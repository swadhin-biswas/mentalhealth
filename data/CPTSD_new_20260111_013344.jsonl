{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "I finally stood up for myself", "text": "***Trigger warning- childhood sexual abuse***\n\nWhen I was around 7 or 8 years old my dad was in town visiting. At this point my parents were either at the tail end of their divorce or finally divorced and he lived in another country. He would come a few times a year to the US to spend time with his four children since my mom was awarded full custody. I have blacked out a lot of my childhood but this memory is one that has always been crystal clear and has stuck with me my whole life. We were all in our living room watching tv, on big couches that wrapped around the entire room. It was very dimly lit, dark even i’d say, the only light was the glow from the tv. I was sitting on my dad’s lap when I felt him slide his hand into the back of my pants under my underwear and he began touching and groping me. I froze, I didn’t know what to say or do, I think it was a mixture of surprise and confusion. I don’t know how long it lasted but eventually he asked me to move so he could get up and go use the bathroom. I was so shell shocked that I didn’t move right away and he had to ask me again. After the movie ended I approached my mom and told her what happened. I felt in my heart that it wasn’t right, I felt dirty and I felt like I needed to tell an adult. But her reaction was more like a non-reaction than anything else. There was no acknowledgment of wrong doing, no asking me if I was okay, or telling me I’d done the right thing. My next memory is sitting in a lawyers office. She asked me to recount what I told my mom, and so I did, and again I was confused as to why the adults didn’t seem to think that anything wrong had happened, or that if they did, why they were hiding it. It was at this point I think I began internalizing that maybe I had done something wrong. After that short meeting we never spoke about this incident again. I was never put into therapy and my dad continued to have access to me and my siblings, even to this day. As I got older over the years my mom began abusing me physically and emotionally. I felt as though she was punishing me or hated me for telling the truth or as she always said to me, “for having a big mouth”. To say I barely survived living with her until I moved out at 18 is an understatement. I feel the abuse I suffered at her hands was worse than what I went through with my father which feels crazy to even say but is the truth. Fast forward to now… I kept this memory and incident buried inside me, I internalized the shame and lived my life until now battling complex post traumatic stress, facing severe depression, dissociation, worthlessness, anxiety, and substance abuse. I was dangerously promiscuous with a hyper sexuality that felt like it controlled my life and I put myself in horribly dangerous situations I am lucky to have survived, and I still struggle to trust people, but despite it all I did survive and I’m now a semi-well adjusted young adult with a “successful” life. In 2022 I discovered the healing power of plant medicine and over the last few years I’ve embarked on 3 ayahuasca retreats that completely shifted everything for me. Two weeks ago I completed my third retreat, and my ninth ayahuasca ceremony. It was during this retreat that I finally revisited that memory I had locked away. The medicine showed me how a serpent of shame was living in me, all curled up, coiled around the inside of my body, warm and cozy, she had been silently driving so many of the harmful behaviors and coping mechanisms I exhibited to deal with the trauma I experienced and the CPTSD I was dealing with. Over the course of the week I was shown the knowledge my mother and other adults in my life had of the sexual abuse, and how the silence and lies and shame is actively eating her alive inside and killing her slowly. It makes sense seeing my mom now, she’s a complete shell of a human filled with hatred and darkness, and I pity her. I was also given the impression that this one memory I have was not the only instance of abuse and that my siblings too may have been victims. That my father operated in the darkness and silence of nighttime while we slept and that it’s a compulsion he has. That his father abused him too and it’s a terrible cycle repeating itself. I purged the serpent of shame during my last ceremony and the relief was instant. I truly feel like I was given a clean slate to move forward with my life in a new way, but the message was clear that in order to really move forward and integrate this healing I needed to face my family and speak my truth in order to end the cycle of silence and shame. When I got back from my retreat I did just that. I’m lucky to have the best grandma in the world, she believes me and supports me and has been an absolute light for me during this insanely difficult time. The rest of my family unfortunately is a different story. My mom admitted to me that she did remember this incident, that I told her and she took me to her lawyer so I could help her case for custody but that she convinced the lawyer it was not a big deal and a one off situation which is why nothing more ever happened. In the same breath of her admitting this she suddenly flipped on me and began denying everything. She said I was fabricating the situation and attacking her and ultimately hung up on me. She has now been telling others in my family that I’m not remembering correctly and making this all up. My older sister is the only sibling I’ve talked to so far and while I felt initially she believed me, after she spoke to my mom she’s now changed her mind. I wrote my dad a letter and while he didn’t admit to anything, he also didn’t deny anything which said enough to me in and of itself. I can tell he’s scared and not ready to talk about it. I hoped sharing my truth would help our family unit heal and move forward but I’m realizing now I can’t force anyone to believe my story or come on this journey of healing with me. I’m disappointed but I also feel the freest and best I’ve ever felt. Why I’m sharing this now on the internet and with you all is: speaking my truth and standing up for that little girl that no one else stood up for has been the most healing part of all of this. I do believe I’ll have some degree of ptsd for the rest of my life but after these last couple weeks it feels like my nervous system was rewired. Something shifted and is healing in me, like getting rid of that snake of shame made room for the light I so desperately needed. For anyone else who struggles or has had experiences that profoundly shaped them in harmful ways, I’m so sorry. I believe you. You are stronger than you know and there is healing and light in the truth. I hope you find it like I did ♡︎ ", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768071243.0, "id": "1q9c7n8", "author": "hopeless-romantica", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q9c7n8/i_finally_stood_up_for_myself/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "why am i chronically unable to let go of this", "text": "the first semester of college ended for me the other day, and i feel like it got ruined by this whole situation its getting to the point where im crying multiple times about this. i havent been able to let this go since august is my reaction warranted? or am i doing too much? i have bawled my eyes about this multiple times, i've called several hotlines in tears, and i dont know if that's normal considering this isn't on purpose. this has bothered me everyday since august.\n\ni was hanging out with my sister the other and we were playing and my hand accidentally touched her chest. it wasnt my intention at all or sexually motivated, and ive been freaking out. i pulled my hand back but didnt say anything, but mentally i was freaking out and was mortified. ive been doing things like replaying the event in my head. basically we played cops and robbers, im the cop, and i was behind her trying to put her hands behind her backl, when i went to grab one of her arms, it was in front and i accidentally touched her chest. i know for sure like 110% certain that it wasnt intentional and had no sexual purpose. this has been pissing me off and bothering me every day since it happened and ive bawled my eyes out and cried multiple times over it. but i dont know if me feeling guilty about this and crying and stressing about it from morning to night is an overreaction or not considering i know its an accident. i literally feel so dirty and gross, and i dont know if thats warranted or not. i wish i said sorry but in the moment i was too shocked too speak so i said nothing. this was in august, and it has been bothering me every day since, BADLY. ive cried about it multiple times and thought about it from morning to night non stop, and called many hotlines. sometimes i feel something weird in my chest and it gets hard to breathe. in the following days i thought about apologizing, and i wasn't sure whether i should or shouldn't. i wanted to say sorry but its such an awkward and uncomfortable thing to bring up, at least thats how it felt for me, so initially i chose to not apologize.\n\ni asked some other people in other subs they said its intentional or im creepy or its a fetish and i know that genuinely none of those things are true, or \"dont touch people without consent but its not like any of that, they said keep my hands to myself but i know its not intentional. some of the other times its happened are like this:the other day, we had to go out to get her hair done so i had to hold her hand as a safety measure. so bc of that we'd have to be close to each other and alot of the time we would bump into each other ,or for example the other day i wwas trying to push move her away with my arm but part of my arm ended up on her chest which i didnt mean to door another time i'd walked behind her and i think my hand brushed by her skirt, which was again unintentional. or we were arm wrestling and i was pretending to let her win so i'd kinda shake my hand aggressively to make it look like a struggle, and in doing so it touched her chest for like a half second\n\nshe slapped my hand, and it jerked my other hand and it hit her somewhere i didn't want. i didn't even think of moving my hand, i believe it just happened cuz of the original slap even tho it didn't hurt or she was sitting at the edge of the bed and i was at the top, lying down, and my feet hit her butt or the other day we were at a store and i was standing by a shopping cart that she wanted to push, so she aggressively grabbed it as a joke. and then i did it back, but when i did it back part of my hand or arm or whatever incidently touched her chest. again unintentional. or we were arm wrestling and i was pretending to let her win so i'd kinda shake my hand aggressively to make it look like a struggle, and in doing so it touched her chest for like a half second these are some of the ones that are causing me alot of distress. with all these it aint on purpose , it isn't sexual, or wanted, but i keep noticing it and dont know why. but i do know that i hate it\n\nthis was months ago and i was very on the fence about apologizing. and just stayed silent about the entire thing. on the one hand, i thought if i didnt apologize then maybe she'd remember it in 10 years and maybe think that it was intentiional or sexual, when it genuinely wasn't and it'd negatively impact her life which is the last thing i want. but on the other hand i thought if i did apologize then it'd plant a seed of fear or doubt in her head about me, and maybe she wouldn't trust me or something. the thoughts of \"what if she thinks its on purpose in the future, what if she thinks it was sexual, what if this negatively impacts her life in 10 years\", kept getting louder and louder in my head, and i wanted to avoid any of that happening. so i chose to apologize. i apologized literally 2 months after it first started bothering me, and the first time i brought it up, i asked if she remembered when we were playing cobs and robbers and i tried to arrest her(since that was the one that bothered me the most, and that was the one that triggered me the most. some of the examples listed above happened before that, but it didn't bother me as much for some reason. but this is the one that REALLY started to bother me), she said no. i didnt ask any further but then the next day i asked her the same thing, and she said remembered us playing it 2 months ago. i said i think i accidentally bumped her chest that day, and said sorry, and that it was an accident. she said \"mhm\" a couple times cuz i kept repeating myself, and that was it. but i still think it'll bother me internally maybe? im not sure. and im not sure if apologizing was the right move to make or i should have left it alone? and idk if i should bring it up with my mom and say i apologized for it, or if i should just shut up. was apologizing the right move? could there by any cons to me apologizing\n\nanother thing is i asked other people, and they called me a chomo, and that ruining HURT. i know that it can't be that. i had no intent, and i know that it isn't premeditated, and i KNOW that it isn't thought out. but i dont understand why it feels like it keeps happening and i hate it so much. and what if what they said is true? or my thoughts are true?? and another thing is. i dont know how to deal or cope with how what people said is online forever now, and that hurts.\n\nhow i can deal with the comments. also if u respond to this saying im doing it on purpose, but passing it off as an accident, or i wanted it to happen, or saying its an \"accident\" you're getting ignored and blocked because those things are just simply not true and isnt helpful, and honestly makes all my feelings 10x worse.\n\nand i also recently started college. and now i feel like whenever i think about the my college life, or at least the beginning of it. i'll just think about this situation and how it has affected me, or think about those comments about me are out there forever(even though they aren't true), and how its tied to the beginning of my college life. . it hurts, and i dont know how to cope with it. i'll think about people insulted me and called me for lack of better words a child abuser, or how i should go to jail and then go to hell, or how i had multiple meltdowns to the point of calling multiple mental health help lines, and even then sometimes the people i'd be talking tried to come off as accusatory, trying to make it seem like i did it on purpose or was intenitonally abusing her. college is such a big part of people's lives, and when i think about how my college started, i have nothing else to think about, except this. i mean my grades are fine, im doing pretty good in my classes. but my mental health has just been insanely bad since a little bit before school started. and ever since february, there have been other things, i would dwell about, or stress about, for a long period, but every time people would tell me it wasn't a big deal. the thing i dwelled about gave me anxiety, and would make me think about it the thing that was bothering me ALL DAY LONG, for weeks/ months at a time. but none of those other thigns comes close to the emotional toll this thing with my sister has taken on me. with all the other things i stressed about, it never made me cry, or call hotlines, or be in THIS MUCH distress, it just made me anxious, and stressed, and i'd think about it alot. but this is by far the strongest, my brain has been fixated on, unable to let go, and the thing im the most emotional about this is such an embarassing and shitty way to start college and i HATE that.\n\ntl;dr accidentally touched someone 4 months ago and i cant let it go\n\n  \n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768070529.0, "id": "1q9bwem", "author":

I initially started due to the impact of a 7 year narcissistic relationship but it’s opened up a lot of stuff from my past, mainly my mother and how I was raised.

My mother is very emotionally unstable and became easily overwhelmed and angry when I was younger meaning I now struggle to express needs and emotions.\n\nA lot of stuff comes up in here about spanking which happened to me if I misbehaved or did something she didn’t like.

I'm so tired of people armchair diagnosing their abusers with NPD. Narcissistic traits/PD is a mental health condition. It's a disability. It's a neurodivergence. It's something people struggle with, and are rarely offered genuine support for because everyone thinks we're evil.  \n  \nAll the things people describe as \"narcissistic abuse\" is just... various types of abuse. Emotional abuse, psychological abuse, psychological torture, gaslighting, scapegoating, victim blaming, triangulation, domestic violence, bigotry (misogyny, queerphobic, ableism, etc), grooming, covert incest, emotional incest, parentification, spousification -- all these words can probably be applied to \"narcissistic abuse\"!\n\nNobody's telling you to not talk about the trauma you endured. No one's telling you that you weren't abused. People who advocate for pwNPD are just saying to make sure you're not stigmatizing an entire group of people based on the actions of your abuser.\n\nMost pwNPD or narcissistic traits are abuse survivors. We're afraid. We're angry. We're mourning. We're trying to protect ourselves. We may not have healthy coping mechanisms but, honestly, a lot of people fucking don't. \n\nAbusers are abusive because they want to be. Abusing others gives them a sense of power, control, and fulfillment. Anyone who says they're abusive because of a health condition is trying to escape accountability for their actions. It can be a factor in their behavior, but that's different from making the choice to hurt someone.", "score": 12, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": 1768069519.0, "id": "1q9bgea", "author": "dead-daughter", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q9bgea/npd_abuser_narcissistic_abuse_is_just_abuse/"}

It helps tremendously with suicidal ideation and even my panic, if anyone wants to know more about it I'm happy to share my experiences. I'm supposed to do 84mg 2x a week but I haven't been able to make a session in a bit over life stuff.\n\n- And my dr just added a new med, Trintellix? Trillix? Haven't gotten to start it yet. \n\n- Meds that we cut off because it didn't help - loreev, a form of ER ativan because it made me so agitated. Paxil, celexa, prozac, geodon, Vistoril/any antihistamine, depakote, trazodone/a lot of mood stabilizers, and at least 5 other meds. My current provider did a test to see what works best for my system because I survived Munchausen by proxy abuse and therefore I'm unfortunately not able to metabolize a lot of common meds.\n\nMy provider also has been actively advocating for me, and we may talk about whether or not disability is even an option soon. \nI cannot believe I lucked out so much on my provider, she's a gem. \n I've had horrific experiences in the past and I'm sure many of us have as well.\n\nAnd my last PTSD specialist therapist who I used to do EMDR with literally ghosted me so I just started regular talk counseling with a LCSW who's been great so far.\n\nI'm around 31, it's taken almost 10 years to find a provider that listens and cares and doesn't shove useless meds down my throat.\n\nSo.......if you're comfortable sharing, what are you taking, or what counseling are you in, if any? Or are you just raw doing survival with CPTSD? \n\n*Hopefully this post goes well and nobody judges each other for whatever works for them, whether you're on meds or just trying to survive CPTSD without any treatment, I wish the best for us all.

I never minded it.\n\nBut once when we had a sleepover and she told me she wanted to \"sit in my lap\". Which sounds completely casual, to me atleast. Nothing sexual.\n\nBut as she did she started to hump me and moan loudly. Which was pretty weird cuz she didn't tell me she wanted to literally dry hump me.\nIt was pretty akward and unpleasant.

I didn't say anything just let her hump me while she moaned and praised me.\n\nAfter a few minutes she stopped and just rested on top of me.\nAnd when I asked like what was this? Or whatever. She told me that she came from the humping.\nAnd I have never felt so damn weird in my entire life. Maybe even disgusted.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "[rant/vent] I watched another of Doctor Ramani’s videos on the Golden Child", "text": "\nI have never been able to find any content related to my sister’s golden child experience. She and I have at least 3, separate, yet interconnected family systems.\n\nOur dad absolutely favored her and still does. She’s the most wealthy and successful, and also the most heavily gifted and celebrated... still invested in.\n\nHowever, she also clearly knows and understands what she is to dad... and she’s very secure in that understanding. Dad was always sort of alone in his emotional immaturity and mom made sure we had plentiful external influence for emotional support and understanding.\n\nShe also assured I had monthly therapy. Mom has passed and I’m now in weekly therapy at age 38.\n\nOur aunt, who was once married to mom’s brother... remarried and she remained an integral support and educational influence in my sister and I’s life. Her family; firefighter and educator husband, his 3 kids, her son and their shared daughter were closer to us than dad, himself... especially at his peak of work stress and responsibilities.\n\nEveryone just sort of accepted that dad was distracted and often emotionally presented as the young kid he was during his own emotional abandonment wounds.\n\nHis older brother was profoundly disabled and unable to even navigate stairs without 5 minutes of very attentive guidance. Their parents built a small 2 story house with 2 bedrooms, a kitchen, a full bathroom and dining area on both floors in order to accommodate him. So, naturally, dad wasn’t fully emotionally cared for and he got the bulk of punishment and parentification.\n\nMy sister is his greatest accomplishment. She knows it... and she was always extremely supportive of me, even when facing dad’s scapegoating. She just only talked about it when she knew we were alone together... quietly and apologetically. She would press dad toward helping me or focusing on efforts toward me as if she were trying to make him feel bad about not giving equal or appropriate attention. She’d also give suggestions that would let her maintain a relationship with her brother after his death... and she’d sort of imply it and dance around things instead of being direct.\n\nI’m still trying to break this down in therapy.\n\nOur aunt and her husband would straight up call dad out on his bullshit with a quick, pointed comment and my sister always respected that. She looked to our aunt for guidance even after she had kids. In fact, part of why her husband married her and his friends remained connected was the community effort around our aunt, her kids and how perfectly we all got along.\n\nThings only fall apart or get vague in moments when dad successfully feeds or starves people into isolation and he successfully dazzles and distracts people into fascination around his own life; boats, sports cars and general success.\n\nOur grandparents home is now a lake house he owns and has renovated a bit.\n\nThere’s plentiful family systems psychology to break down... and I’m not a professional.\n\nI’m just trying to recover from scapegoating now that dad’s primary scapegoat, mom has passed.\n\nStill... dad’s never malignant or vicious. He’s avoidant and will lie about wrongdoing publicly then get very generous almost apologetically. He still holds firm to most lies... especially if the truth seems to threaten the security of his public relationships.\n\nHe likes to sweep things under the rug and some of his traits have disseminated into a somewhat emotionally avoidant immediate social cluster.\n\nMy sister did start working at 15, making regional manager at 17... and she had a vast Catholic education and social system raising her with dad’s money.\n\nShe was often referred to as “too smart for [her] own good” just as I was occasionally.\n\nI often have trouble reconciling the clear differences I always notice in descriptions and videos like this. We have this oddly prosperous homeostasis in our family.\n\nI don’t know who to share this with or how to discuss it.

I remember telling my sister to hide in the bathroom while I hid in the closet. I think this connects to real life, because the last time he got physical with me, I hid in the bathroom. He threatened to break the door down if I didn’t come out, so I opened it. I think that’s why in the dream I told my sister to hide there without me so he wouldn’t know I was inside and break the door down.\n\nI don’t remember everything that happened after that in the dream, but I think he started beating me. I tried to defend myself by hitting him with a hairbrush, but it didn’t hurt him at all. I felt weak and unable to stop him, which mirrors what happened in real life when I tried to defend myself and couldn’t.

No reassurance, no attention, was ignored and left to rot in my room all day like an inconvenience. Never checked up on, bare minimum physical needs met and nothing else.\n\n- July 2023: Suicide attempt, resulting in my inability to tolerate anything about my neck and ongoing flashbacks.\n\n- Around 1 month during age 16: Medications not given. I was left in withdrawals so bad I struggled to stand up straight. I was in pain near constantly from brain zaps. Unable to concentrate, worse than my threshold. My abuser wouldn't be bothered to get a refill, too busy smoking to bother.\n\n- Once off event at 16 or 17, I was sexually assaulted by a child who was 13 and mentally disabled, unable to tell what he was doing. Regardless, I resent him. He touched my groin, pawed at it and tried pulling down my pants to which I successfully stopped.

Didn't know what else to so I told the counselor in which she called my parents. Yeah excepted now that I look back at it. After about a week my mother took me to a \"psychiatric care\" (won't reveal name or location because I dont want former staff looking for me) facility in which I didnt know at the time I just believed I was going to a therapist. I told them the same things I told my friend and mom, which that I was struggling with suicidal thoughts and alot of anxiety like I believed everyone was talking behind their backs at me. \n\nThis taller guy was the one who came in the room around 5 minutes after me saying this and grabbed my arm and proceeded to drag me into an elevator to some floor way above the ground level, every door needed a keycard and it felt like going through a military prison. In the child unit or whatever its called I cant do my research because ill start breaking down I was constantly recorded on a tape player by this one lady in which everytime my parents would call she would threaten to tell my parents I was getting worse to keep me here longer. I watched small children drugged and beat and dragged away by men 5x their size. I only had one friend there who was this girl who had the same issues as me and I felt like she was the only person who actually ever understood me.

This began to happen daily for a month in a half because I stood up for my friend, I can still feel them throwing me into my rooms cold shower and leaving me there for what felt like hours. \n\nThought about getting into mote detail but its yo much for me, its been around 7 and a half years now and everyday I resist the urge to take myself out because I have having to deal with the flashbacks and the sobbing of my old friend and her getting shit thrown at her daily.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Need for validation, my parents didn't beat me or kick me out, but...", "text": "I'll start there.\n\nLast Tuesday, during a discussion with my psychologist, I told her that we needed to talk again about my parents, but that I didn't feel justified in doing so because I had never experienced any traumatic events. I then told her, “But I feel so broken,” and she replied, “Then you have experienced trauma.”\n\nIn 2025, after four years with this therapist, I started talking about my parents (I feel comfortable with her). I think she had already tried to steer the conversation in that direction, but I had quickly ended the discussion with, “It's not my parents' fault. They've always been there for me.” The problem is that when I started discussing it on my own last year, I quickly stopped. Because I felt ashamed, as if I were persecuting my parents, even though they have always supported me (financially)... After all, I'm 30 years old and still living at home. Others haven't been so lucky, and I wasn't beaten either.\n\nI keep coming back here in my search... That's why I'm reaching out to you. I think I'm looking for answers, or validation... I'm not really sure.\n\nI don't even know how to begin... I don't have many memories of my childhood. My parents always worked, so I spent quite a few years when I was a little kid with my grandparents. I've been told this, but I don't really remember it. So yes, I remember my grandfather's fig tree, the schoolyard, a few faces of my former classmates, and a few events... But too few for my liking ans too few good memories.\n\nWhat I do remember is how important school results were. I wasn't exactly a model student and I had to work to get good grades. I remember those entire evenings spent doing homework, crying and my parents screaming when I couldn't do it. How many times did I feel sick to my stomach when faced with my revision, my assessments, my grades. How many times did I not want to go home because I knew I was going to be scolded and punished for my results... Mind you, when I say punishment, I don't mean anything physical, it was my passions and hobbies that were targeted, punished with no TV, no video games, no Lego...\n\nSo I spent my entire school career trying to keep my head above water, to get average grades. It's funny to think that it never encouraged me to be an excellent student... I was a child/teenager with an average grade (11/20 french grading system). I also spent my school years keeping quiet because I knew that if I told my parents about hobbies or new interest, it would be a new source of punishment... In the end, I didn't have many hobbies outside of video games at the time.\n\nIt's really stupid... Because the more I write, the more I see the elements in front of me. But my parents did teach me one another thing, that my feelings don't matter, it's what the doctor says that's true.\n\nToday I'm 30 years old, I'm afraid to leave my parents' house, I don't have much self-confidence, I'm afraid to oppose any form of authority, to upset the people around me, to face the consequences of my actions... My relationship with my parents has never been as peaceful as it is now that I no longer have school results and I have a job. I am actively trying to heal my mental health, I feel like everyone around me is eating better food than me and that I have to smile because “hey, it could be worse.”\n\nI came across this today, shortly before deciding to write this ([https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/z5y930/12\\_complex\\_ptsd\\_signs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/z5y930/12_complex_ptsd_signs/)), and I check a number of boxes... (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12).\n\nDuring my schooling, I was content to go where I was told and where I was reasonably good, which was computers. In my teens, I locked myself into relationships that were going nowhere but were comfortable... My 20s were marked by depression and a disastrous start to my working life.\n\nOn a slightly more positive note, even though I feel like I'm behind, I'm building myself up, trying out hobbies I couldn't experience when I was younger, opening up a little more to others, asserting myself, and actively fighting to give myself a future I can be happy with.\n\nI want to sit in the passenger seat of the world and no longer have to watch the road (and the wall ahead), but rather contemplate the landscape and do my best to become an illustrator... A profession with a future, right? Joke.\n\nSorry this is long, I'm way too talkative, thank you for reading.\n\n\n\nTLDR; I feel ungrateful for blaming my parents for the fact that I feel broken and maladjusted, when they have always provided me with everything I needed materially. Most of my memories of my childhood and adolescence are of pressure related to my school results, crying, stomach aches, and punishments.\n\n \n\n ", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768062022.0, "id": "1q9883y", "author": "EmotionalYaourt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q9883y/need_for_validation_my_parents_didnt_beat_me_or/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "This specifically is what I think makes this feel like sexual abuse in experience &amp;/or trauma processing. Even if the spanking wasn’t done with any sexual motive or intent &amp; wasn’t meant to be experienced sexually, it’s exactly as you said. That explains why it still has effects resembling sexual abuse trauma, like OP feeling dirty about/from it. \n\nOP u/The_upsetti_spagetti, trauma is subjective. What objectively happened is never the truly important part, it’s how it subjectively affected you. We all know trauma lives in the body, the body tends to remember our trauma better than our conscious minds. Regardless of the sexual intent behind the spanking, your description &amp; recollection of it sounds strikingly similar to others who’ve experienced (intentional or unintentional) SA. That doesn’t mean you experienced wrong or are interpreting it wrong, but it is an example of why spanking children is increasingly being understood as abusive—bc it causes harm &amp; can have lasting effects. I can understand why you might wonder if you’re overreacting, you mentioned your mother would have to find a stick to be spanked with when she was a child. There’s a shift in generational attitudes toward spanking/hitting children as punishment—*for good reason*—but that shift is a little slow bc generations that were spanked/smacked as children often think it justifies using some of those same strategies for their own children (like your parents). But just bc your parents may not feel that being spanked as children had a harmful lasting impact on them; just bc you didn’t have to go find a stick to get spanked with like your mom had to as a child; whether or not your parents faced “harsher” punishments as a child *does not* mean that your experience &amp; its effects are just you overreacting.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "Yeah, I think it can have the same effect as sexual abuse, especially in the case of what you've just described.\n\nJust like sexual abuse; you experienced violence, violation, humiliation, shame, scorn and guilt. And you were made to feel that way only because a stronger, authoritative person/people wanted to feel in control of you in a very sick self gratifying way. \n\nAll abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual, verbal, is about control. Physical abuse and sexual abuse are control through violence. So both of these things overlap a lot, and each child/person will experience their own adverse effects based on a myriad of factors (co-occuring abuses, age of onset, prolonged, abuser proximity, etc). But more often, sexually abused children will experience identity disruption and lack bodily autonomy in adulthood, while physically abused children will experience hypervigilance and emotional dysregulation. Again, lots of asterisks there and however you respond to the abuse you experienced in childhood is appropriate and valid for you and the situation you were put in.\n\nSo if you FEEL like you experienced sexual abuse, if you think calling this abuse sexual will help you to paint a clearer picture of your family dynamic, cope with the adverse effects you continue to experience now, then by all means view it that way. But if you're wading against it, if you feel like calling it that is grossly exaggerating how \"weird\" your family is then don't call it sexual abuse. \n\nTo be fair it really is sliding off the edge into sexual trauma, but it doesn't matter how a clinical or the DSM-5 defines it.

They'd decide in their own minds that I was some wicked spawn of Satan that was possessed by the internet and homosexuality, and beating me would fix it.\n\nI to this day talk to much in situations context or explaining myself is needed, because internally I'm at a plea with the other person to at least listen to me, \"I'll tell you everything, you don't have to believe or hear me, just listen please don't come to conclusions\"\n\nIt makes me a personal nuisance, although I'm lucky to have a partner and friends who have pushed me to separating my childhood fears from the present.\n\n\nBut closing off the beatings I got made me more vulnerable to being harassed, if someone didn't like the way I spoke (like a speech impermanent I had) I'd take it, and I wouldn't report it, wouldn't fight back (I eventually did but that's another story regarding the failures of schools and anti-bullying)\n\nThe degradation made me prone to being derogatory towards people who I felt wronged me, it gave me sexual interests regarding more hardcore kinks and individuals that can sometimes reflect how I was treated by my parents, and between the parents and the school system, and even the police (other story) I often distrust adults (anyone older than me, I'm 21 now but I absolutely get weak when there's anyone that's a noticable generation older than me)\n\nAnytime really I'm in any sort of social situation, good or bad, going to the store or talking with a friend, I'll have the leftover mindset of being at risk of being harassed by my parents for disappointing them, or I straight out feel like they'll just step through the door and begin taking authority over me (weird stuff).\n\nLast but not least, it made me secretive, which definitely caused problems in my relationships, and I've only recently got it under control.\n\nThings get better, things get worse.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "Dude, it freaking sucks that you experienced that; I'm so sorry. ❤️\n\nMy dad used to relish in spanking me. He delighted in taking the time to think up and meticulously craft \"attitude adjusters\". \n\nHe would then look for reasons to use them, and I knew it was coming even he told me to \"assume the position\", which meant coming over and standing in front of him, pulling my pants down, and bending over to grab my ankles. \n\nHe not only then had a full, up-close view of my butt, but because of anatomy and because I was bending all the way forward, view of my labia, too. \n\nHe insisted on leaving a mark because if it didn't, it wasn't effective. 🙄 And he would keep going until it did. He wanted me to remember him disciplining me when my butt and bits hurt afterwards when I sat down.\n\nSometimes it was his hand, sometimes it was an attitude adjuster.\n\nBig wooden spoons with a variety of amounts and sizes of holes to play around with how aerodynamic they were, how hard and fast he could make them go, and what kind of marks they would leave. \n\nHe really enjoyed sandwiching just the handle of a wooden paint stirrer between two more wooden stirrers and taping the three together at the base as a handle so there was a gap between the two full-length ones, and when they hit my bits, it made an even bigger and \"more satisfying\" smacking sound. \n\nHe was a tinkerer, and took great pleasure in creating and testing things like that.\n\nThen there was the belt, of course, and part of the routine was that it had to be folded over with one hand gripping each side then bringing his hands together, which pushed the middle parts of the belt out and apart, then quickly pulling his hands apart to make the middle parts snap together loudly. \n\nHe always had a dark grin when he snapped his belt before spanking me with it. With any of them. He wouldn't clap his hands together, but he would vigorously rub his palms together to \"warm up\" in preparation. At least once he spit a little in his hands \"for extra grip\".\n\nHe liked to spank low, too - usually just at the base of my butt, just above my labia. And sometimes, his hand would land just a little lower, so part of his palm would hit it. \n\nPart of me felt dirty when his attitude adjustments would include the bottom of my privates, but every once in a while he would tell me that because he made me, I was technically his property until I turned 18, and he could do with his property as he pleased. 🫤\n\nHe said this to me when I was very young, too. It's one of the three memories I have of being an infant. He was changing me and once clean, he probed my vagina with his fingers. When I squirmed and cried, he held me in place with his other hand over my torso and said (I think more to himself than to me) \"I made this, so it's mine.\" \n\nBut you know what upsets me the /most/ about all of it? 😡\n\nThat I'm into being spanked now. \n\nThat typing all of that out brought me tingles and stirring in my genitals. \n\nThat it's like getting turned on against my will. \n\n\nHe would make me assume the position at his friend's house and Louie would watch dad spank me, but when we were at his place, I didn't have to pull anything down - I would get to keep my pants up as I stood before my dad and bent over to grab my ankles. \n\nHe would sometimes say be was going to let Louie spank me. I used to imagine him doing it, though, and guessed that he would be much more gentle. I would wonder what his rough hands would feel like (he was a mechanic).\n\nBut he never did have Louie spank me. So to imagine your family all having a go just feels very messed up. Very Cinderella. I'm so sorry you went through that. \n\n*It was sexual abuse, and your body knows it.*\n\nI heartily agree with the commenter who advised that you take the time to really intentionally sit with this and what feelings come up from it, and to take nourishing care of your body with water, good rest, and good food, because your body (and mind) processing this IS hard work and it takes a toll! \n\nI suggest as you sit with it, embracing your inner 4 year old and letting them ask \"Why?\" to things that come up, and letting the answers come to you. Then \"And why?\" along the way. Personally, I find this a very helpful process in... well, /processing/ things. \n\nI wish you the best, OP. ❤️❤️❤️", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768070468.0, "id": "nytwhih", "author": "MollysTootsies"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Does anyone think it’s possible to find someone who values both conversation and quiet presence?", "text": "Does anyone else think it’s possible to find someone who genuinely cares about presence?\n\nI mean someone where it’s enough, sometimes, just to exist together. Of course I care about talking, about meaningful conversations, about doing things together—intellectual discussions, fun or interesting activities, spending real time with each other. That matters to me.\n\nBut sometimes I just want being in the same room to be enough. Sitting together, even in silence.\nEven just being on the phone without talking—hearing background noise, knowing you’re not completely alone. That kind of quiet closeness helps me function.\n\nEspecially because there are times when I get really tired and genuinely struggle to speak, physically or mentally. I’m not always able to be coherent. Most of the time I can listen, and I actually love listening to people talk and paying attention—I just can’t always respond verbally in the moment.\n\nI know that’s hard for people to understand. I don’t expect friends to want to sit on the phone in silence, and I get why a lot of people find that weird or pointless. But for me, it’s grounding.\n\nRecently I went through another traumatic event—something I hadn’t experienced in years. Ironically, it’s been harder this time because I’m more aware than I used to be. My dissociation has been worse than usual ever since. I’ve spent much of the summer and this first semester unable to track a thought for more than a minute when I’m not sufficiently distracted. My mind drifts into uncontrollable strings of thoughts—not hallucinations, not normal daydreams either. I’ll lose time, forget where I am or how I got somewhere. It’s unsettling.\n\nBecause of that, I can’t always do basic conversation on demand. If you ask me how my day went, I never really know what to say because I genuinely don’t remember. I hate being asked how I’m doing—I’m too tired to keep lying, but I’m also sick of being depressing or worse yet a cause for concern.\n\nWhat I want is to listen. I want to care about people, to make them smile, to add something good to their lives. I still love intellectual conversation—it excites me. I like broadening my perspective, learning how other people think, and I do have ideas and things I want to talk about. But I can’t always handle the pressure to constantly be insightful or articulate. I’m not at my best, and forgetting words or stumbling over sentences makes that expectation exhausting.\n\nI think this is why I’m drawn to people who have their own full lives—friends, interests, things they enjoy doing. With people like that, silence doesn’t feel like a problem. They don’t need me to fill every gap, and I don’t feel like I have to constantly be talking. At the same time, being around social people actually helps pull me back into the world—I want to be social and do things, but doing them alone doesn’t bring joy. Doing those sorts of things with people whom I share a real connection with is what makes them meaningful to me.\n\nI don’t want to be someone’s entire world. I don’t want to have to match someone else’s energy or volume all the time. Beyond the words, ideas, and perspectives I offer, I want to be someone you can talk to and relax with because I’m not judgmental and don’t require constant performance—someone whose quiet doesn’t feel like absence.\n\nI want to find someone for whom my presence alone could sometimes be enough. Not all the time—I still want to talk, do things, go out, and show up for them when they need support. But someone who understands that quiet togetherness matters, and who isn’t annoyed by it—or even enjoys it.\n\nAnd maybe someone who can tolerate a bit of sadness—not all the details, not complaining, not everything—but who understands that sometimes I’m in pain and just want a hug and not to have to speak. Sometimes I just want to live in the space between words and noise.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Or has anyone actually found something like this?\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768059383.0, "id": "1q973eq", "author": "sleepdeprivedturtle6", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q973eq/does_anyone_think_its_possible_to_find_someone/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "My CPTSD isn't a memory, it's a machine: How my \"Power Model\" defense mechanism continues to manufacture trauma in safe environments.", "text": "[Cultural Context Note]\nThis analysis is rooted in a high-context, collectivist East Asian environment, where implicit social rules and group harmony take precedence over individual expression.\n\nThis post is about a theory I built when I was 11 years old—I call it the \"Power Model.\" It once protected me, allowing me to survive in a social world I couldn't understand at all. But today, 13 years later, I realize it has also imprisoned me.\n\nIf you have ever felt like an eternal \"outsider,\" or if you need rational analysis to understand what others do naturally, perhaps my story will make you feel less alone.\n\n1.The Beginning\n\nAt 11 years old, in middle school, I was mocked.\n\nNot occasionally, but continuously and collectively.\n\nWhat bothered me most wasn't the mockery itself, but that I genuinely didn't understand why. I couldn't figure out what I did wrong, or why everyone else knew how to react while I was clueless. Even the teachers felt there was \"something wrong\" with me.\n\nI tried imitating others—joking the way they joked. It backfired, attracting even more disgust.\n\nBack then, I didn't know I had ASD and ADHD. I only knew one thing: I couldn't read the rules of this game.\n\nBut I had to survive. So I did the only thing I could: I started to analyze rationally.\n\nAnd then, I built a model.\n\n2. My Discovery: Social Interaction is a Power Game\n\nAfter long-term observation, I reached a core conclusion:\n\nThe essence of social interaction is a power game.\n\nDiscovery 1: Invisible Class Structure\n\nAlthough everyone is nominally equal, everyone actually occupies a \"class position.\" This position determines:\n\n * What you \"can\" do.\n * What you \"cannot\" do.\n * How others will treat you.\n\nI realized that everyone's behavior must align with their class. This is why my imitation failed—I wasn't in that position.\n \nThe same joke is witty coming from a high-status person, but offensive coming from me.\n\nDiscovery 2: Bullying is the Simplest Way to Gain Power\n\nI observed that bullying spreads like a trend. Why? Because bullying climbs the ladder.\n\n * The initiators raised their status.\n * The followers didn't necessarily hate me; they wanted to attach themselves to the leaders to share in that power.\n * Power is control. By mocking me, they lowered my class and gained control over me, thus elevating themselves.\n\nDiscovery 3: My Position\n\nI spent a long time thinking about my place in this system.\n\nConclusion: I am a Dalit.\n\nAnyone could mock me.\n\nEven though I had good grades, I didn't belong to the circle of \"elites.\" I was like a high-class courtesan in a novel—useful, perhaps respected for utility, but everyone knew my true station was never with them.\n\n3. My Survival Strategy: Fawning and Attachment\n\nOnce I accepted my position, the question became: How do I survive?\n\n * Improve grades? Useless. I was already good, but still a Dalit.\n * Change behavior? Worse. Acting \"out of class\" invited more ridicule.\n * Improve speech? Failed. My internal complexity couldn't be translated into words.\n\nFinally, I found the only effective strategy:\nFind someone willing to protect me, fawn over her, and lock onto her.\n\nJust as others joined the bullies, I needed to attach myself to a protector to gain shelter under their power. This became my survival mode for my entire student life.\n\n4. How Power Sensitivity Permeated Everything\n\n(1) I Cannot Accept Kindness\n\nBecause I was younger and had poor self-care skills (ASD traits), classmates often took care of me. But to me, being taken care of is a marker of a subordinate. \n\nIn those moments of kindness, I felt extreme anxiety, pain, and even anger. \n\nI knew they were well-intentioned, but my model screamed that I was being dominated.\n\n(2) Compulsive Analysis\n\nI felt I had to constantly analyze the \"flow of power\" in every interaction. If I didn't understand the hierarchy, I couldn't make the \"appropriate\" reaction.\n\n I analyzed social interactions all day, suffering from emotional flashbacks at night. I completely lost control of my brain.\n\n(3) Inexpressible Pain\n\nBeing mocked in middle school was one thing. Being treated like a child in university was another form of torture. \n\nIt is a cruel paradox: my external image is completely severed from my internal cognition. I see everything clearly, but I cannot let others know that I see it.\n\n(4) Even My Sexuality\n\nMy sensitivity to power shaped me this deeply: I found that what excites me isn't sexual satisfaction, but the power dynamics reflected in the act. \n\nMy orientation became extreme BDSM—not for the \"play,\" but for the raw power differential.\n\nAs Oscar Wilde said: \"Everything is about sex, except sex. Sex is about power.\"\n\n5. How This Model Shaped My Life\n\n * Social Life: Seek a protector -&gt; Fawn. (When I had no protector in college, I hid in my dorm bed in infinite panic).\n\n * Priorities: I was numb to stress unless it involved survival. Exams meant nothing. The fear of a potential social crisis always outweighed my future.\n\n * Loss of \"Like\": I don't know what I like anymore. In the Power Model, there is only: \"Does this raise my status?\" or \"Will this make me lose status?\" There is no space for \"Do I enjoy this?\"\n\n * Maintaining a Fake Identity: I got my degree and a job not out of desire, but because Identity = Class Label. Without it, I am a Dalit.\n\n6.The Fundamental Difference Between NT and ND\n\nIt took me a long time to realize the difference between me and Neurotypicals (NTs).\n\nHow NTs Play:\n\nThey gain status naturally. Social intuition guides them on autopilot. They often don't realize their motives are power-driven, but they do it unconsciously.\n\nHow I Play:\n\nI need conscious effort just to achieve \"normal\" status.\n\n * Realize I need status.\n * Analyze how to get it.\n * Execute strategy (Fawning).\n * Monitor results.\n\nThe Trap:\n\nBecause I lack intuition, I must rationally analyze every behavior, so I see the power dynamics that NTs are unaware of.\n\nBut because I only use rational analysis, I mistake \"Power\" for the entirety of social interaction. NTs operate on multiple dimensions (emotion, connection, interest). My world was simplified into \"Only Power.\"\n\n7. The \"Overfitting\" Problem\n\nLooking back, I realize my model has a fatal flaw. In machine learning terms, it is Overfitted.\n\nThe model performed perfectly on the training data (the bullying environment), but when applied to new data (normal society), it produces catastrophic errors.\n\nIt is a Bullying Defense Guide.\n\nIt works in hostile environments. But in a normal environment, the core assumption—\"Everyone is fighting for status, care is just a form of power\"—is false.\n\nBecause the model is \"half-true\" (power exists, but isn't everything), it is hard to falsify.\n\n * Someone shows kindness -&gt; I interpret it as power assertion -&gt; I submit/fawn -&gt; They treat me like a child -&gt; My status as \"lower\" is confirmed.\n\nThe model doesn't just observe reality; it manufactures reality. I pre-set all of humanity as enemies to protect myself.\n\n8.My CPTSD is Self-Manufactured\n\nThis is the most terrifying realization. My CPTSD is not just a residue of the past. It is being continuously manufactured by this model.\n\nThe Mechanism:\n\n * Trigger: A normal interaction occurs (e.g., a smile).\n * Interpretation: The Model says \"This is a power check. You are subordinate.\"\n * Reaction: I feel humiliation/threat (identical to the bullying era).\n * Reinforcement: I analyze the threat, reinforcing the Model.\n\nStandard PTSD is a flashback to a past memory. My situation is a continuous production of trauma. \n\nSince middle school, I haven't met any truly \"bad\" people. This means my CPTSD is entirely created by my own cognitive framework.\n\n9.The Cost\n\n13 years later.\n\n * I don't know what I like. The model only asks about utility.\n * I maintain a false identity just to avoid being a Dalit.\n * Meaningless Pain:\n If there were a parallel universe \"me\" with ASD/ADHD who didn't build this model, she might struggle, but she would be pursuing her passion. \nI am enduring meaningless pain, maintaining a mask just to avoid reliving the trauma of being 11.\n\n10.Why I Can't Escape\n\nI know the model is twisted. I know it imprisons me. But I can't get out.\n\n * It's my OS: It's not a thought; it's how I perceive the world.\n * The Loop: It is self-reinforcing.\n * No Alternative: Without social intuition, I have no other \"sensors\" to perceive dimensions other than power.\n * Fear: Not analyzing is scarier than analyzing a threat. \"Not understanding\" is the ultimate terror.\n\nFinal Words\n\nI write this not to find an answer. I've spent 13 years looking for one.\n\nI write this because:\n\nMaybe there is someone else who replaces social intuition with rational analysis.\n\nMaybe there is someone else who sees power dynamics and mistakes it for everything.\n\nMaybe there is someone else trapped in a model they built, seeing the prison walls but unable to walk out.\n\nIf you are that person: You are not alone.\nAnd to researchers and therapists:\n\nSome people's CPTSD is not a \"residue of past trauma,\" but a \"trauma generated continuously by the current cognitive system.\"\n\nThis is my \"Power Model.\"\nIt once protected me.\nNow it imprisons me.\nAnd I am still trapped inside.\n", "score": 11, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768056388.0, "id": "1q95v6s", "author": "Living-Box309", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q95v6s/my_cptsd_isnt_a_memory_its_a_machine_how_my_power/"}

A medical doctor will eliminate some causes and that will give you a sense of reassurance just by virtue of knowing what it isn’t. There are two possible outcomes. One is they will find “nothing”. Then the next step is mental health care. The other is that they will find something. Then you can attend to whatever they find and the next step is still mental health care because you already know that there is deep trauma. Deep trauma won’t go away. It will continue to try to get your attention with symptoms until it gets the attention it seeks. You are only 18. I am 57 and was 49 when I first started paying attention. Your body still has a ton of resilience at that age. A lot more than I had, and I was still able to start healing and reverse many health problems that came with it. \n\nDr. Schubiner and Dr. Sarno have written books and developed protocols to get at some of the needs that are under chronic pain. You can easily find information about them by typing in their names and chronic pain as search terms. \n\nDo find a therapist. A therapist that has specific training for complex trauma. Sensorimotor therapy, Internal Family Systems, are two examples. \n\nYour body is in conversation with you. That’s why you feel pain. It’s not punishment or even a sign of “illness”. Healthy bodies send signals when something is needed. The pain is the signal. The “illness” is a healthy signal to unhealthy conditions and causes. You have agency, your body knows that and it’s addressing that agency. \n\nJust in case you can’t afford therapy, here is a post I wrote with free and cheap resources. But still get a therapist if you can. Some therapists have sliding scales. I can’t quickly find the original post, so here is the content:\n\nFree or nearly free healing resources I use:\n\n1.\t⁠Neurodynamic breathwork: all online, first session then first month FREE, then US$60/month. https://breathworkonline.com/\n2.\t⁠SOMA app by Niraj Naik: all online, app has some free sessions, weekly live online sessions free, second app tier $10/month https://www.somabreath.com/\n3.\t⁠Subscribe to Sounds True newsletter via email.

One need is validation of you as a person and of the obvious fact that you are in pain.  I’m sorry you don’t always get the compassion you deserve and seek. A lot of people care, a lot of people who care are not skilled in offering validating responses.  and some people don’t care. Unfortunately, it is up to us, and will always be, to remember this and choose who we vent to or what we do with their responses. Other people’s mistakes and missteps are not your failure though. \n\nIt’s good that you have a therapist. They are probably benefiting you and that’s good. That said, it looks like you have needs beyond what they are comfortable with or even trained to recognize. Start looking for somebody who is specifically trained for trauma. Bullying is grave. A well intended therapist who is effective in some ways can still be inadequately trained to treat trauma. In the mean time you might want to write an email to them saying that you are reconsidering your goals and needs in therapy. Therapists keep your goals in mind. An email might allow you to express your needs more convincingly and might allow the therapist to offer a more helpful response.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768057515.0, "id": "nysnm2m", "author": "TogetherInLife"}

I was raised as a hard core people pleaser and didn't feel like I ever deserved anything good.  But who knows where you would be if your body didn't jump in and start helping you mask your pain?  When you are young, its is your only option.\n\nYou can start slow.  No false positivity because your nervous system will know.  One day say, maybe I'm not the worst person in the world? 🤔  And let that marinate. Maybe the next day you might think your hair doesn't look half bad. Each time you catch a mean thought coming through, try to actively stop it or rephrase it. It becomes easier once you start.  You deserve love like anyone else.  But you can't look outside yourself anymore for it. Us CPTSD kids have been looking for love in all the wrong places.  Someone said to me once...would you ever say the horrible things you say in your head to a child or even an acquaintance?  Well no, of course not.  So why would you say it to yourself who is already a damaged little kid inside?🫤  \n\nOur parents did us wrong.  So we have to be our own parent now.  It sucks.   No doubt.  And feel free to let all the anger about how unfair that is come on out.  Don't dismiss your own feelings.  They are legit.  Starting the process of being kind to yourself is a big first step.  Its really only phase 1, but I never made any progress until I figured that out.  How can you convince your nervous system that you are safe when you still have a bully living in your head?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Growing up hearing “no” to everything, now that everything is “yes,” I don’t want anything anymore. Anyone else?", "text": "I grew up with an OCPD father. Love was there, but control was everywhere. Almost everything was a “no.” Going out, field trips, visiting friends, attending functions — nothing was allowed easily. It wasn’t framed as punishment, but as protection. Going out was dangerous. Friendships could lead to the wrong relationships. Freedom always came with fear attached to it.\n\nSo I learned how to survive within that system. I learned how to ask for permission. I would mentally prepare for days before bringing anything up. I’d plan how to present it, what words to use, when to say it, how to convince. Then came days or weeks of convincing, begging, crying. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn’t. But that process shaped me. Wanting something meant fighting for it.\n\nI carried the same pattern into my marriage without realizing it. Before doing anything, I would prepare, explain, convince. One day my husband looked at me and said, “Why are you trying to convince me? If you want to do something, just do it. You don’t need my permission.” That moment hit me hard. It was the first time I truly understood that not everyone works like my father did… and that I’m actually allowed to make choices freely now.\n\nBut here’s the confusing part. Now that everything is a “yes,” I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I don’t feel excited to go out, to buy things, to plan things, or even to want things. It feels like the fun disappeared along with the resistance. When nothing needs to be fought for, nothing feels urgent or desirable. It’s like my motivation system was built entirely around restriction.\n\nI’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this — growing up with heavy control and then feeling strangely empty or unmotivated once freedom finally arrives. How do you adjust to a life where you don’t have to beg, convince, or earn permission?

I was watching this version of Alice in wonderland it was in black and white and than I dissociated and I was in the movie, and with one of my very first exs ever and we were exploring these hallways that had different doors and every door we opened was just another childhood trauma that I've experienced. \n\n\nThan somehow it lead to me and this ex having sex and for some context this irl event was when I was 11 or 12 and was my first sexual trauma expirence. I was young and naive and said yes cause i didn't wanna lose him and we had no protection either. It was a huge er visit and luckily I never got pregnant or any stds / stis. But did ignore me and dump Me after traumatizing me fun shit. \n\n\n But the unprotected part is what happened in the dream and I kept saying as my child self in the dream \"we shouldn't it's not safe what if I get pregnant?\" And he responded in the dream with a fuck it attitude. \n\n\nThan when we finished and he finished inside we had to continue crawling through these hallways than we got to this more opened play ground like area and than he just suddenly disappeared and I was alone with this thing chasing me. It looked a kin to a bonnie plush from fnaf and this also leads to another trauma that I live with.\n\n\nOne of my ex best friends we were friends for 15 years and we bonded over fnaf and so many other fandoms we even roleplayed made ocs all that stuff back when I was 11 - 16. And this playground was right near where I use to live and we always hung out there. \n\n\nGoing on I than left the nightmare scape by sneaking through this drain thing you see in Manhattan streets. And I shrunk down went through and woke up in my childhood bed. I was looking for an adult to talk to and they all just left me. When I tried to call my mom or dad these fbi workers tried to kidnap me and through some fuckery I escaped. \n\n\nWhen I tried to tell my than friend group [ all made up of ex friends who left cause my adhd was \"to much\" or that I wasn't social enough with them ]  they laughed it off but when I said \"hey this was a movie I'll show you guys what I saw!\" We go to the theaters and everything and before they can see I get kidnaped again and boom my alarm wakes me up.\n\nThis is one of my worst nightmares and my last year plus this year so far have been rough. I recently had to leave behind my childhood home cause my parents have bed bugs and I don't wanna carry that to my new place. My mom is taking it seriously my dad isn't. I'm redealing with the loss of my sister and that's piling on. And to add insult to injury I almost took my own life If my roommate didn't talk to me. Plus my tourests are picking up again.

Currently with private therapy (going on two years) and although with known trauma, awareness of CSA for one year. There's more but I hope you get the jist. \n\nThe question:\nI've had voices for decades but I wasn't aware that they weren't mine. That came through therapy and when I noticed or became 'aware' it freaked the hell out of me. Since then, it's pretty much the norm of listening to the conversations, some clear, some not, some stopping once I get wind of something, sometimes so much noise that I can't hear myself think and it's very disorientation but ...\n\n... I thought \"okay, that's not too bad I suppose, no? What else could happen?\"\n\nI was wrong. \n\nOne evening (recent), I had a strong sense that my thoughts were not my own. I mean like, I was shoved back, way back and the person thinking wasn't me. It was so clear and I heard  ... \"I'm not you, I'm XXX\". \n\nOmgosh, I never sensed so much fear and awareness from both sides like that since I, 1. Realised the route cause of my trauma, 2. Realising the conversions I heard where not mine. Even now when I try and think back ... Its like. If I looked into a mirror and then noticed the face looking back wasn't me but instead of a mirror it was all happening in my head. \n\nWhen I tried to bring it up in session, something happened that caused an erratic, vocal and somatic response that even now I can't make sense of. \n\nBTW I generally know something is up when I get the CSA somatic responses. That took a long time to accept now that I understand why thanks to therapy. \n\nI can't make sense of it and I'm just even more confused as I've been for the past how many odd frigging years!\n\nJust when I think it's going okayish, bang!

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "Diagnosed DID here. Hearing voices isn't always sign of DID, but very, very common with dissociative tendencies and CPTSD. Most professionals aren't up to date but current studies show that ~5%+ of the population is affected, likely to rise given the current increasing global stress.\n\nUsually voices are associated with repressed or dissociative parts of the self. They can range from programming (voice of an abuser and shame looping in the mind) to partial switches without amnesia (OSDD1b, PDID, etc) to full blown DID (amnesia between switches, split-screen reality, high degree of emancipation between parts...).\n\nWhat you describe is very familiar to my experience. Especially if they/you have enough emancipation to claim a different name. But best is probably to ask for a MID218 test etc to assess how much actual amnesia and dissociation you are actually facing.\n\nIt is a very, very misunderstood condition with a ton of stigma and mystique around it (Hollywood didn't help). Fear is normal. But even in the context of DID, with enough curiosity, compassion and collaboration between these parts, the situation can become an amazing adaptation boosting resilience and prosocial capacities.\n\nA lot of excellent people and therapists I know around have DID, they just don't talk about it because in our society, it is akin to coming out as gay in Central Africa.\n\nDID is a normal reaction to an unbearable situation. It keeps people alive as a last resort while they faced terrible things hard to fathom. It is the wound of \"no one helped\". The mind might even create the village that was supposed to be here for us.\n\nHaving parts talking to each other is actually a great development imho.

Especially for csa or prolonged trauma in childhood, it quickly becomes absolutely essential to your survival to analyse a situation, a human, a face, a movement in a split second to accurately predict what to do next to not get hurt or if you can feel safe or are in immediate danger.\n\nThinking at this high pace (was always told \"you think too much, you could use your energy for something else\" or \"you should worry less\" or \"why do you analyse everything so much?!\" - srsly just typing it makes me angry when I think of those ignorant people who would say this 🙄) often comes from a thing called introjection. Poorly said, you start to think FOR and like your abuser, like \"if i hurt myself the way you do, you don't have to do it to me anymore.\". So it's also a desperate try of your brain to protect yourself. \nIt may also be linked to emotionally unstable and/or immature caregivers, like taking responsibility for their feelings, feeling everything for them so they wouldn't have to.\n\nAlso, I was raised in the belief that only if I was working or getting things done, I would be worthy of love. Kinda became a core belief to always be busy and never stand still (also mentally!!) or else my existence wasn't justified.

I've met plenty of \"lower IQ\" people who struggle massively with over analyzing, rumination, looping thinking, etc. And plenty of super high IQ people who don't. I mean presumably if you have CPTSD your nervous system is in a perpetual state of fright and therefore you are using these coping mechanisms like over analysis to try to regulate. So I don't believe lowering your IQ would help whatsoever. I think trying to forge a sense of safety within your body is the only thing that helps.\n\nI would be extremely wary of a psychiatrist who think that \"low iq\" people are happy because they dont think as much, or something bizarre like that. Besides being so incorrect it is just a mad thing to say, its also quite cruel. Surely they also have many patients with a below average IQ as obviously this population can suffer with mental illness too. And cptsd is caused by trauma, not by being too smart, so really anyone can have it. Honestly the whole thing sounds like quite an insult.\n\nAlso I think you need to find support that is trauma informed because it's also quite ridiculous to suggest that you can change your thinking as a traumatized person.

Around 4 of those years were very focused, deep trauma work. About two months ago I had what my therapist and I understand as a “core trauma contact.” It felt like touching a live wire with high voltage — extremely raw, overwhelming, and destabilizing.\n\nWhat surprised me even more is what happened after.\n\nSince then, many of my life supports and identities have started collapsing one by one. It’s become painfully clear that a lot of what I did, who I was, and where I was going in life was driven by trauma adaptations.\n\nThe most painful realization is this: my entire life I lived with a belief that if I endured enough, tried hard enough, stayed strong enough, then things would eventually be okay. That belief gave me hope and kept me going. Now I see that it was also a child survival mechanism — and after the core trauma contact, it no longer works.\n\nI understand this intellectually, but emotionally I’m struggling a lot. I feel like I’m in an integration phase where old supports have collapsed and new ones haven’t formed yet. It’s terrifying and deeply disorienting.\n\nOne question keeps coming up, even though I know it’s probably not rational: why did I even start therapy? Right now it feels like therapy took away my faith in the future, and I don’t yet have anything solid to replace it with. I feel lost. I keep reaching for things that used to help me cope, but none of them work anymore.\n\nI know people say “it’s darkest before the dawn,” but honestly right now I just need to hear real stories — from people who went through a phase like this, survived it, and later felt that therapy was still worth it.

And she is right. I still have low days, but am also noticing small random bursts of joy and even excitement which are very different from the happiness I felt in the past.  Way more real and honest.\n\nI finally had to ask myself, would I really go back to that person again if I could? The answer came right away, absolutely not.  Underneath that happy bouncy mask was an extremely sad, lonely and neglected girl.  I have plenty of scars, but I can now build a life of consistency and respect.  I could never go back to living in a delusion.\n\nIt's going to take time and adjusting, but ultimately we are on the better path.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "I don't have a story like one you're looking for, but I think it's felt very dark sometimes but also light other times throughout my journey. Not really a \"darkest before the dawn\", but I think I'm learning to accept that my life is not a movie and so I can't expect everything to be fixed suddenly; this is something I have to live with and it's also not a \"fixing\", but rather learning to live with who I am and accommodate that person, instead of trying to bend myself to fit some normative idea of a functioning person who is healed. I think two years ago I also had this feeling of not having something to look forward to / faith in the future, and in many ways it is still persisting today. But it's been helpful to try to look for who I am, if I strip away the layers of trauma and defence I have built, and that's lead me to a few things, for example coming back to my core love of literature, wanting to go back to school, etc. I still feel really really shaky about it all, but at the very least it feels true to me. So I think \"reaching for things that used to help me cope\" actually doesn't move you forward, because what you are doing is coping; it might be helpful to try some creative practices, find which ones stick, especially if you're able to ignore those really critical voices in your head.

I feel like I’ve been absorbing too much and it’s starting to make me feel small and weird. So I’m trying to have some boundaries often as simple as “hey, don’t talk to me like that” or “can we pause until we can speak calmly”. Thing is this seems to be a massive trigger for her.  She feels as though, I’ve been really extreme, like I’ve been aggressive and I’m trying to check myself but I really don’t think I am. it sets off a spiral, when she gets angry or triggered or whatever it is… it just doesn’t calm down for ages,  she gets really contemptuous, and critical, I think then I try to then over explain or try to repair and keep a connection, (I think this is my own anxious dynamic) but that seems to make it worse… the therapist suggests I walk away but I’m finding it really hard. Also because she keeps saying I’m being cold or distant if I do. Or even when I do go into another room she comes after me and keeps going. I feel like she wants it to keep going, like even if we spoke about and resolved one issue, the thing that triggered for example, she’ll bring up something else to keep it going. I feel like I need to leave the house but I find that really unsettling to have to keep doing that. \nI feel really scared by the lack of effort or ability to deescalate or repair or calm in these moments.  \n\nI read Pete Walkers book on CPTSD and it feels like she goes into a fighting trigger and into what he calls the outer critic… like she works really hard to blame me, to say that the reason she feels the way she does is because of me and if she can’t find a good reason in the current context she’ll find something from anywhere, from 10 years ago. Getting so worked up until she’s flailing around in anger. she eventually crashes into this exhausted state of everything is shit, nothing is going to be good.  I feel like this is really hurting a trust for me that we can stay with some kind of connection and care even when there is friction. \n\nI’m really torn needing to have some boundaries so I can feel my integrity in the face of her behaviour, and it causing so much friction and triggering her.

I've had lots of trauma from childhood, but the last few years I've been seeing an amazing therapist who doesn't pathologise me, lets me be me, doesn't punish for extreme emotions. in my class there are people training who have never lived through any trauma and its clear to see in their lack of insight and understanding. but there's a couple, like me, who have been through trauma and are in late stage recovery who I know will make a difference when they qualify. The training in the UK is three years long with lots and lots of self analysis which normally weeds out the wrong uns in the first few weeks. I truly believe that to be a genuine therapist you need to have had some sort of negative life experiences which makes you uniquely qualified to understand things from the clients perspective. Not to know exactly how it feels for them but to have true empathy for them. For myself if I can help someone be the best version of themselves (yes I'm quoting Carl Rogers, who is prick) then they're on the right pathway. I don't want to change anybody, I want to be able to give them the insight and strength to live with their traumas as much as possible.

It takes 3-4 years part time although level 4 is full on (2 years) seeing clients, being recorded and then pulled apart in supervision!! All a learning curve. Then you can get BACP registered and practice. Trauma work therapy is level 5 which you can't do unless qualified and working as a therapist. I chose not to do a university course as I felt that was too academic and wanted to learn in a charity that counsels trauma survivors. As I understand it somatic work would be a personal development course you could take once qualified, in the way I'm doing the process. It's also a lot cheaper to do it this way. However if you wanted to go down the university route then you'll come out the end of it with the ability to be BACP registered. in training we get a lot of stuff said to us which I might not agree with, but for me it's keep my mouth shut, even though sometimes I want to scream at the tutor and think as soon as I get my own practice I can practice how I want to practice.

Unfortunately I don't have any tips for around London way but you could look into charities that support domestic violence/rape/sexual assault survivors. there's a young girl on my course who wanted to do what you're thinking of doing. doing level 2 in counselling and then doing a degree in counselling, however after doing level 2 she decided she liked the learning environment better in the charity. She's already done a degree so made an informed decision. I'm studying through the charity, at the end of it I'll be a qualified counsellor/therapist. Both descriptions mean the same thing nowadays. level 2 isn't marked outside of the training centre, level 3 is where your work goes out to be moderated. Level 3 is a huge step up from level 2. much more demanding. More homework etc. You're watched as to how you get on with your peers, lots and lots of role-play and a lot of laughs! How you take negative feedback. I probably do around 10 hours of homework a week. I can't compare it to a degree in psychotherapy at uni as I have no info on that however I do know that it's much more academic focused. I prefer being on the ground floor so to speak and being in smaller groups, level 4 you get a placement and have to do 200 hours over 2 years of 'counselling' with a client where you are observed by a qualified therapist. Personally, I would do it the way I'm doing it and then do a personal development course on somatic work. I plan to do level 5 (trauma) when established in my own private practice.

Many older therapists also don't use the newest evidence based and trauma informed approaches, unfortunately.\n\n\nAre you seeing psychologists or clinical psychologists? It's so much more unaffordable but I have a friend who is a psych and she explained to me the difference in their training and suggested I only see clinical psychologists (here in the aus system).\n\n\nOne of the strategies I found really helpful before I could afford therapy was to go to the provisional psychology clinics at universities. They charge much less than registered therapists and often do telehealth now. The students are in their final year of clinical psychology placements and heavily supervised so it means they are up to date on the newest treatments as they've just done their masters or PhD, and they're really conscientious because they want to pass their course and get better at delivering therapy. ", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768051621.0, "id": "nys6i6g", "author": "No_Cheesecake5080"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "DAE have a hard time watching movies because of trauma (vent)", "text": "So because of my trauma with authority figures, especially parents and teachers I have a hard time watching alot of movies which depict strained parental relationships and harsh teachers. But also I end up breaking into tears when I see movies which depict more kind gentle and openly affectionate parents and teachers. It goes both ways.\n\nAnd it really sucks for me because I love watching movie and generally consuming media and literature and oftentimes many of such movies in question happen to be my favourite movies \n\nFor example I really really love the movie Dead Poets Society. Infact its actually one of my current hyperfixations because I loved that movie so much and reasonated with the message it presents. It even became one of the reasons why I am looking forward to become a teacher in near future. It also brought me out of a creative slump i was going through because I was on abilify for a while before and its side effects really crushed my self esteem. \n\nBut despite all my love for this particular film it is a very much a hard watch and i hate that its such a hard watch for me. Whenever I see the father and son scenes with Kurtwood Smith and Robert Sean Leonard in the movie I physically shut down like my body just cant take it.  Those scenes mirror my reality very much and parallels my relationship with my own parents. Even if my parents would disagree because they have allowed me to have the very human right of autonomy my parents are exactly like the father in the movie. They constantly tell me how much they regret letting me choose humanities over STEM because I still struggled. Even when I told my mum about the mean science tutor &gt;!grooming and eventually raping me for years as a child!&lt;\n\nIt also doesnt help that because of how much my parents have hurt me growing up and even right now in my early 20s just like RSL's character in the movie I have quite a history with &gt;!suicide and self harm!&lt; I have dealt with those thoughts since I was ten and last summer i had attempted twice because I could not take them anymore. I really loved RSL in the movie, he is very dear to me and like I said before, i absolutely adore this movie and I really wish I could easily watch it movie multiple times. And I want to be able to watch it fully without having to skip scenes because those scenes are important too. I guess this movie cuts me that deep because I have lived that life.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Why I don’t see my childlike traits as a problem anymore", "text": "I’ve read a lot of posts on here that frame age regression and being childlike as something unhealthy/shameful. But in my experience it’s also been healing and I was wondering whether we can talk about childlike coping that’s actually healthy?\n\nI grew up way too fast and missed out on being a kid and having someone take care of me. As an adult, a big part of my personality is childlike. I have childlike enthusiasm. I’m a little naive. I like doing childlike things such as making snowmen, arts and crafts, decorating, playing games, stuffed animals, etc. My partner is significantly older than me and I enjoy the playful dynamic that comes with that at times.  I’m also a physically small person which I guess adds to the childlike vibes I like to engage in. \n\nBeing childlike is a way for me to experience the care free youth I never had, and also a way for me to just enjoy the moment more. I think as adults we’re expected to let go of our childlike wonder and that’s unfortunate. \n\nYes, age regressing, being naïve and wanting attention from older men has certainly caused me problems in the past. But after doing a lot of healing, I’m at a point now that I can recognise when it’s safe for me to be a child and when I need to be an adult. I’m able to set healthy boundaries in my relationships and find a balance between receiving care and giving care.\n\nI guess in my experience, healing doesn’t have to look like getting rid of all your childlike coping mechanisms, but rather finding a balance and being able to engage in them more consciously. Instead of it being a switch stuck at either 100% adult or 100% child, it’s become a sliding scale I can navigate more freely.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768036695.0, "id": "1q8zofy", "author": "SummerTeaLeaves", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8zofy/why_i_dont_see_my_childlike_traits_as_a_problem/"}

I was there for a week, maybe a little more, I dont remember. But how could they tell? And why. Was it an obvious medical diagnosis? Could they see me and just tell right away? Or maybe it was my medications?? I know they were in contact with my therapist, but all the data he had on me was so surface level. Did I just act like someone with CPTSD? I dont doubt the diagnosis. I know its true. The signs were all there. Im 22 now, and I think I was 20 when I went. But of course, time blurs for me so I cant remember.\n\nBut after it, I just felt really pathetic. Because I dont remember much that would make me have any traumatic memory. In my mind, I was just weak to life. I even told my mom the diagnosis, and she was shocked. Because my life was fine. It wasnt all happy go lucky. But it wasnt some traumatizing, horribly abusive life.\n\nWas it just weak?? I think about it and I feel like I traumatized myself because I just wasnt ready for the world. Ever since I was a kid, it was paranoid and anxious. I was diagnosed with childhood depression, ADHD, ADD, and bad anxiety at age 7. At that point, my little brother hadnt died. I dont think he was even sick. Ill be honest, I remember being kissed by slightly older boys. But at the same time, the memories are so foggy and mangled in my mind, and I've had the weirdest imagination my whole life. I cant be fully sure.\n\nI was a troubled kid in school. Id always have break downs and id get sent to the kindergarten class as punishment. No one was hitting me. Any abuse i suffered was a brief moment in my life. Im not trying to downplay it, but its always felt like people have gone through worse and they dont describe it as fully life altering. They deem it bad times in their life and they move on. They dont go to mental hospitals and get diagnosed with CPTSD\n\nThey dont take meds their whole life and have to get told theyre being put on more anti psychotics to combat constant nightmares and debilitating paranoia. Am I weak? Did I grow up weak? Bad things happened to me, and I've grown. But im 22 and I cant sleep without my baby blanket and stuffed animal. I freak out at the thought of dissapointing someone.\n\nI feel like im just unwell. And its upsetting because I know I'll never be okay. Not as okay as other people. I know everyone has baggage. And no one's 100% mentally sound. But why do I feel like I was less equipped than the average child. \n\nAnd I dont mean anyone that has CPTSD is weak. I just feel like that \"appropriate\" reasons they developed it. Long term abuse. Horrific accidents. Constant bad home life. And for me it was just.. I was a scared, anxious kid.

CPTSD isn't one incident but rather a thousand tiny insults or jokes by adults or kids that hurt you.

I know it sounds harsh but that's pretty abusive to constantly make someone flinch and then laugh about it.  And if they've been doing that your whole life, it results in you not feeling physically safe.  The adults thought it was hilarious...but how was a little mind supposed to understand it wasn't real?  😢  Our parents grew up with a lot of tough love and it shows. \n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 43 and when I look backwards on my life, all the emotions made sense!

There are large sections of my childhood that I don't remember.  I know now that is because I was in fight or flight for most of my life and my body was just trying to keep me alive.  It didn't have time to turn those traumatic events into memories.  And thank goodness!  It does that to protect you.  Your brain will literally shut down to conserve your reflexes because it does not know the difference between emotional and physical danger.  \n\nBelieve what you feel.  Reading your posts, I can see you kinda sense the truth but accepting it is hard.  I always thought I had a good childhood but once I started listening to my gut and allowing my true feelings to process, I found so much bad stuff I was hiding.  Just because a family looks normal on the outside doesn't mean its healthy.  Once you start allowing yourself to feel the feelings,  your inner child will start to tell you more. Not everyone is irrevocably damaged.  And you don't have to stop loving your parents.  But you have to stop abandoning yourself by continuing the narrative your parents and aunt and uncle gave you.  They may not have intended to hurt you,  but they were reckless with a small child's feelings.   And to hear you say how far back you were sad...I'd wager that you needed a little extra love and instead got the opposite.  Everyone needs love and kids need it at the right time so they can grow up as a whole person. Their job was to teach us how to self soothe and regulate our nervous system.  Not pretend to hit you and then laugh when you have a natural reaction to it. \n\nIf you can start showing love to that little kid inside and listening to the feelings that come up instead of laughing them off, you will start to see a mental switch. But your nervous system won't trust you until it feels safe. \n\nI grew up around a lot of careless adults like that and was also bullied at school by mean kids.  As an adult it makes me angry to think of how anyone could treat a kid like that.   Maybe they aren't bad people, but they did cause harm.  It's ok to feel that.  I think the biggest problem we all have is the guilt of even admitting our parents didn't do a great job. Try to start giving yourself grace,  you deserve it. ❤️", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768057791.0, "id": "nysogsp", "author": "RevrsEngineer"}

My husband is one of the lucky ones who is very mentally healthy and stable so he is my rock. We agreed if I ever said it was too much, no questions asked my husband would step in with Bub and give me space unless I asked for support.\n\nEarly pregnancy my dr warned me that due to childhood trauma pregnancy can bring up a lot of emotions and that I needed to be very careful and vigilant of how I was feeling. My trauma involves a lot of self hatred so during pregnancy I did worry i wouldn’t be a good parent, I worried I’d regret having a baby. I talked all this through with my dr and husband. They reminded me bad parents don’t worry if they are being bad parents. \n\nBaby was born and I didn’t have that “magical moment” of connection people talk about. It took me a few weeks until I would say I adored her. That’s completely normal, lots of people just don’t want to talk about it. My parents didn’t come to meet baby for a few weeks and that fucked with me a bit. (They live 10 minutes away) A lot of my trauma is from childhood neglect and abuse so being “neglected” again as an adult really got to me. I didn’t realise until my daughter’s birth how much I hated being called mum. It made me think about my own mother and I think the idea of having the same name and title just disgusted me. It wasn’t until my baby first started calling to me as mumma that I’m now okay with it.\n\nMy worries are gone about being a bad parent, I’m a great mother. I think some of my trauma had potentially made me a better mother. I’m very empathetic and patient and don’t often get frustrated with baby. Sometimes I do have moments where I look at my baby and think about how I was treated at the same age and it really distresses me but I know how to work through that. I have nieces and nephews that have hit ages where I had major trauma happen to me and that was very hard but in a way I’m glad that I figured out how to work through that before having a kid of my own. \n\nOverall I am happy I had a baby. It has also helped to heal me in some ways. We share some features that I always hated about myself but seeing them on her I adore them. She is so so so cute. She has my eyes I always thought were a weird shape and my nose I always thought was too wide. Now they look perfect to me. Also being someone’s safe space is just amazing.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "I think one of the most valuable things we have is we are aware of our CPTSD. This means that if you want to be a parent (which I think it’s different than having children), you have to consciously understand and chose that your children will go first. You will have to put yourself aside and focus on them and their needs. If you’re ready to do that commitment (now or in the future, in my case I’m working on this with my therapist), I think it’s a good thing to know what kind of parent you DON’T want to be. I know I don’t want ANYTHING of my personal shit to mess with my kids, so I’m not having any until I’m completely healed or at least healed enough to understand myself fully and understand how my actions my harm my kids. There’s a lot of stuff I know I will never do to my kids or put them through. And a lot of stuff I will give to my kids and teach my kids, things I never had and craved and I think every healthy kid should have from their mother.

And if it’s something you really want to do, then go ahead, but do your research and work with a therapist so your own trauma doesn’t affect your kids. It’s the same with any other mental issues, you really have to understand how you life is different than “normal” people and how it may affect your kids and then work so it doesn’t affect them.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768053008.0, "id": "nysac8s", "author": "Worried_Raspberry313"}

I have CTPSD from being scapegoated, the black sheep etc. My dad only knew her for 1 year before they divorced, and he has repeatedly guilted and triggered me for going NC with her, although I don't feel any conflict/drama otherwise, I'm doing it out of necessity because I barely functioned before, I function a little better now, but I still have lots of recovery and healing left. Any time I see my dad I feel judged and attacked, even though he doesn't know anything. Because of this, I also tried going NC with him, but because he never \"did anything\" to me, I felt a lot of guilt for it. I'm ONLY seeing him out of obligation, and I don't feel cared for or \"Loved\" in the slightest by him, I only feel judged. When I tried to distance myself from him, my grandma guilted me into contacting him again, with the result that I am again hurt. Strangely, it seems as if everyone close to my dad has gone NC with him, and I don't really get it, because he's only been triggering to me because of existing trauma, and never did anything bad. That'd make me feel horrible by also going NC with him because he'd basically be alone, but at the same time I feel like it's knowingly hurting myself/almost self-harm anytime I speak to him. He does cross boundaries a lot, and just makes me feel so uneasy, sad, heavy etc., even when I don't regularly think about my family life anymore. I think I'm just going to reduce contact by a lot without breaking it fully, because I know I'm still going to be hurt every time (it's been years at this point and it doesn't seem to get \"better\"/more tolerable).\n\nThank you, don't know what the point of this is, but I'm guessing it's probably very common to be guilted by others for going NC, or in some cases also feeling guilt?", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768028037.0, "id": "1q8xayt", "author": "Working-Wish-789", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8xayt/guilted_for_no_contact/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "p.2 of my drug induced psychosis during a concert", "text": "I just need to write this down (partly again). I don’t know how else to process this.\n\nSo my friend reached out to me, as I already stated in my edit. It’s alright now. I guess.\n\nThe psychosis made me realize something. I experienced in my childhood several kinds of abuse. I‘ve never had anything stable in my life. Nothing and no one, I could rely on. I knew that already. But what i‘ve now realized fully, is nothing hurt me as much as the abandonment I went through for most of my life. Especially in my childhood.\nI was born too early. I had to be in an incubator for 3 months. I was born with hypothyroidism, that went away eventually. Of course my mind can’t remember the incubator, but my body did. I was 18 when i realized I developed ptsd from the incubator. Until I was 10 when it was dark at night I had these visions and feelings I couldn’t explain. I never tried to explain because I haven’t had the vocabulary for it and I assumed I would‘ve been ignored anyway. This intense feeling of being trapped, almost claustrophobic. The deafening silence that makes you hear your own organs. The feeling you’re completely on your own and even if you did try to scream nothing would save you. I had visions of smooth curved surfaces. I couldn’t explain why it made me so uncomfortable. \n\nWhen I was around 3 my mother (filipino) stopped learning the language. She just gave up. She never taught me hers and she didn’t learn mine so there wasn’t much of a relationship. I couldn’t ask for the most basic stuff because she didn’t understand. My father was a workaholic with possibly ocpd, my brother a sadist that made sure to let me know regularly he didn’t want to spend time with me, my sister ran away and my mother used any opportunity to get away. I was on my own. always. I was medically neglected. I‘ve had a lot of accidents in my childhood that led to injuries and was sick a lot but that didn’t bother my parents. Financially i was neglected too due to my father’s ocpd tendencies and not because we didn’t have money. We are or at least my father is fairly wealthy. He couldn’t even buy me a proper helmet for my scooter or bike. He thought our retro neon purple and pink ski helmets were good enough…\n\nNot even I could speak our language. Which is the core of my avpd. I speak differently than the people in my country. I had to learn how to communicate myself because no one spoke to me enough I could actually pick anything up. In kindergarden and school i avoided people for several reasons. So i guess I mostly learned how to speak by watching TV. TV is in a slightly different language. Some people say it’s just a dialect but it’s really not it’s very different. In my country the spoken language is strongly tied to their national identity. I‘ve experienced all my life racism, bigotry especially language related and backhanded curiosity of others. \nI have never felt I belonged anywhere. \n\nAnd that’s exactly what my psychosis mirrored.\n\nI‘ve never exactly processed a certain trauma I went through. It was one of the main things my mind latched onto during the psychosis. I haven’t thought about these aspects of this specific trauma ever really. When I was 6 my mother and I went to the philippines. She pretty much just abandoned me there. Left me with strangers. I had no privacy at all. Toilets were in the middle of the room with no walls or stalls. Some stranger showered me. I was terrified and felt violated. And I couldn’t say anything because they didn’t understand me. At one point we were on the beach and no one told me i couldn’t walk there barefoot. I caught a parasite. Some time passed and i was half paralyzed. I couldn’t move my legs and was in immense pain. my mother and aunt told me to shut up when i cried and made me walk myself to the doctor. At the doctors office i saw heavily disfigured babies. and then when it was finally my turn the doctor came with a ridiculously huge needle. like 4mm in diameter. Some people held me down and I think i passed out after i saw it. \n\n\nDuring the psychosis my mind constantly repeated „philippines“ like that would explain everything that ever happened in my life. I haven’t exactly had any memories of anything. I thought was in a loop. And i‘ve never experienced anything else than what happened in the loop. I was completely paralyzed. i didn’t move, speak or react. I just let things happen. There were several points during the ambulance ride where i felt violated. They put needles in me and immediately i thought „philippines“. My body remembered what happened in the philippines. Some paramedics were hovering over me and once they lifted my legs to get to my fanny bag around my hips to look for my insurance card (which I absolutely never have with me btw except that night for some reason) that’s when I thought „brother“. Back when we were kids he was constantly pinning me down and straddling me. One paramedic called me „really weird“. Another was shining a flashlight into my eyes and said „it’s obvious what kind of case this is“. In my psychotic state I thought it’s obvious I was dead. \n\nIn the hospital I was still psychotic. I thought i was there already a million times and it always ended the same way no matter what I did. I thought in the last round of the loop I tried to flee by attacking the nurses. And I almost did the same again. I was really close of jumping from the bed attacking some nurse and just run for freedom and trying to break the loop. But I thought I tried that a million times already and it never worked. It’s learned helplessness. So I stayed and sat there quietly. There was one irregularity in this new loop though. One of the nurses spoke MY language. That threw me off. That might’ve been the trigger that made me slowly snap out of it. I was like he wasn’t there before. Who tf is this?\n\nAll my disorders were at their peak during my psychosis. I have cptsd, avpd and pure o ocd. The replaying of trauma in different ways, the anxiety, the not talking because i felt the way i speak was shameful, and constant intrusive thoughts and judgments on my self. When the needle was inside me i thought I was disgusting. I remembered the feeling of all the times in my life where i enjoyed pain. My mind kept telling me \"you probably like that, right? you like getting violated, right? You’re so disgusting, no wonder you’re in hell. You really deserve this\". \n\nWhat I felt during the psychosis was like being indestructible in the worst way possible. Like i‘m not human but a spirit that can’t be destroyed. Like pain is endless. It was like floating in space in eternal nothingness and you just wouldn’t die. Nothing to grab onto. Just completely on my own for all eternity. I felt like god was punishing me and I deserved it. That my kind of hell is exactly this. Being trapped with no way out and no outlet. Just on my own. \n\nI keep repeating what happened during the psychosis. I was more or less fine for one week but now I think of the severe hallucinations and heart palpitations before the psychosis. How it felt like my legs were dying and melted together so i constantly had to force them apart. How I tried for 2 hours straight to ground myself. And then the start of the psychosis was the worst. Mind you i was in a concert. I had visions from childhood (i still don’t know if that is part of the psychosis or if i actually had visions I had when i was kid and i remembered them). Memories flooded me of the vision. I knew everything that happened during that night before it happened. How i tried to do reality checks and every single one failed me. How even the reality checks were part of the loop. How I looked at my watch and time stood either still or went backwards. Everything I saw was proof for the loop. Like i’ve seen it all before. I felt trapped in hell and that realization was what paralyzed me. I saw myself getting lifted up from the floor, dragged and carried, and people crowding me a million times. And I just didn’t care anymore. I gave up. The absolute worst was the feeling i had. In hindsight it was the same from the incubator. This deafening silence even though i was in the middle of a sold out concert. the same thing happening over and over and over and I can’t do nothing. Truly just trapped and alone.\n\nMy avpd is also constantly attacking me now because of what happened. How i acted even though i was literally out my mind. Normally I have extreme levels of self control and obviously that wasn’t present. My mind is trying to convince me my friend who i went with doesn’t like me and that she thinks I was being inappropriate. Even though that’s a lie. I feel embarrassed how I held her hand for dear life for most of the concert. Right before I completely lost my mind and then fell to the floor I was either hugging her or she hugged me. I was holding onto her for dear life. But I already thought she wasn’t real and never was. I was crying for 3 seconds, stopped, walked backwards, fell and became unresponsive while semi awake.\n\nSince then I‘m always close to panic attacks in crowded places. I used to kinda like concerts. And yeah it’s been less than a month since the event so obviously I‘m still in the process of healing but idk… Concerts especially metal ones were one of the few things I was able to look forward too. Now it’s gone too. One of my favorite bands slaughter to prevail will soon come to my country but I can’t go. The last thing I want is another trip to ER. I‘m afraid my heart will either stop, I can’t breathe or will develop psychosis again but this time without drugs.\n\nA very sick part of me kinda wants to experience it again. Like my life feels so empty and numb that I willingly make myself suffer. I‘ve always kinda been like that. And it’s so weird and ironic because on one side i‘m extremely careful, disciplined and always health concerned but I also have a very masochistic side.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "My biggest recommendation is curiosity and not trying to fix anything. If she’s triggered and it’s upsetting for you then attend to your own needs for regulating your emotions. Often ppl w cptsd have trouble knowing how to regulate when the distress is so high. The nicest thing a partner has ever said to me is I’m here I’m not going anywhere I’m here with you and just finding connection. Also when cptsd isn’t addressed it definitely doesn’t get better with time, it gets worse. I also recommend little things like music is a great regulator it can change your mood so quickly and that can be helpful. I guess I’m saying if you are able to be supportive while maintaining your own health then she’s really most likely afraid of not having some level of basic need- safety, connection, uncertainty, abandonment, neglect. The most painful thing in a partnership for me was when we started dating after a couple weeks I was upfront with him about my cptsd and that I’m deep in process of healing and I told him he should maybe just read some things about cptsd for his own protection and mine as well. It can be emotionally draining. He never looked it up over like a year until I got triggered by the fires in La completely erasing my childhood neighborhood a year ago, and he couldn’t handle just sitting with me in the sadness and the disbelief, he had to fix it - it made him uncomfortable. And his fixing it was minimizing or some toxic positivity. He then looked it up-cptsd. I think he thought I was like just another drama queen invoking the word trauma until he witnessed me in a full episode. But it hurt me more than anything that he never looked it up. Like if a crush of mine has some pain or illness that I don’t know much about I go research it immmmediately.

So long as you keep letting her know that you are there and wanting to support her and follow through on that support, then things will work out.\n\nIf that’s not enough and she’s in therapy, ask her if you can attend one or more sessions where you focus on your relationship and how you can best support her.\n\nI’m having relationship struggles with a family member, and my therapist suggested we do this. It’s not “couples” therapy, because we both aren’t individually working on our own issues as homework (because my family member doesn’t think they need therapy - I disagree), the focus of on me and how I’m struggling, and when their struggles come up my therapist focuses on my response and what I need to do to change (because as they said it’s unethical for them to provide therapy for my family member when these are my sessions and they aren’t wanting therapy). I’m just sharing this in case you don’t think you need therapy either, you likely won’t be put on the spot about anything or whatever.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "My suggestion would be to explore this in therapy with your therapist. For me my best healing has come when things have got difficult with my therapist, and when we've done the work to get through it. \n\n\nIts seriously seriously scary to do. Because it shifts from a relationship where I wasnt really 'in' the relationship, to one where I was. And all that that risks.\n\n\nAnd, in complete honesty, I never have managed to fully work things through completely with therapists when things go wrong, because I feel like I'm 'making a fuss' by 'not letting things go', if its not resolved quickly in one or two sessions.\n\n\nAnd, even at the level I've been able to work things through, raise them, be heard, its been hugely valuable.\n\n\nFor two therapists, their response helped me recognise that they weren't sufficiently able to bring themselves and take accountability, for them to be safe for me to heal with. And for the others, they showed they're human and prepared to step in, look after themselves, be assertive, and also grounded enough to take appropriate accountability.\n\n\nThe stuff that comes up relationally and how its handled by a therapist is really important in terms of us feeling safe enough to do the work with a therapist, and also relational work is ultimately whats going to help us to heal and be in the world. As cptsd is ultimately about terror around being in relationship and healing is finding healthy ways to be and feel safe when in relationship.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1768032607.0, "id": "nyr5e5x", "author": "TryingToBreath45"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Hi, I am new here...would anyone care to see my story?", "text": "If interested, here we go\n\nWell...more like a vent because I've never (I think) vent to this extent before... with clarity.\n\nTo the earliest of my memories, I remembered a family that wasn't my biological parents. Apparently, I was left in a different country, with great aunts and uncles, so that my parents can work to earn money. That was a happy time of my life...before I met \"those people\". I think around 4 yrs old, my paternal grandparents \"introduced\" me to them...hey these are are mom and dad. Oddly, I recall the scene. We were at some sort of carnival, a merry-go-round, crowds...strangers acting close. That is where my happy memories ended.\n\nGrowing up...memories of hunger, and silent nights fill my head. Dark figures float in the corners of my eyes. I hide under my covers. If not for days of solitude, or locked in the bathroom and stairway ... a strong hand comes down and knocks my breath away. Blood spills from my nose and mouth, bruises forming on every inch of my body. Screams of panic, as I'm tied up and head plunged into a deep bucket of water, drowning to catch my breath. Long nights \"standing\" on my knees, feeling my very malnourished weight crushing my knee caps. Mop the floor and clean the toilet or else you can't eat! Throughout all this, my young brother witness my cries for mercy. I had thought he did not understand, as he did not faced the same treatment...a doted son.\n\nAt some point (I think I was 8-9) I was left at my maternal grandparents, while my parents and brother went on a trip for a month. The memory is foggy...but one night...my grandfather took me back home and slept in my bed. Just us. Boundaries broken where it shouldn't be. Years later, we came into contact again, and he asked: do you remember that day in the summer long ago?\n\nWhen I was 11, one night exploded in a violent outburst. My neck twisted to the point I thought it would snap. Screaming between my parents and hands were thrown. And then silence. My brother and I were left alone in the house. Neck aching, I resolved the choice to run away from this hellhole. My brother decided he has to stay with me. He was only 8. Grabbing what little belongings my 11 yr old self thought was important... some pictures books, our 3 turtles, jackets...and we left. Wondering the neighborhood, a day passed... it wasn't long until a kind officer found us.\n\nOur journey through the foster system was a blur...it wasn't easy. Finally, we landed at a home - a family of 3, and a lovable dog. For us siblings, it was a culture shock. Rules were put in place, and table manners with enforced at every bite. Bedtime at 9pm sharp. I dont remember when but I started to get the feeling that I was not well liked... my brother? he was an angel to my new foster family. Was it my fault I didn't know how to express myself? Was it my fault that I can't answer a simple phone call correctly? Was it my fault that I wasn't \"normal\" like my brother? I guess to them, it was.  \n\nChild services set up meetings, at our approval, for our biological family to see us. I was reluctant, angry and resistant. The hatred was to the point that I blocked out my ethnic language to avoid \"hearing\" them. These people never gave me the time of day, and now they're acting nice? HAH.  \n\nMy brother had more frequent meetings with the biological family. To this day, I believed they bribed him away from me...and back to them. And so...we were separated. My foster family decided to adopt me into the family. Growing into my early teens and into young adulthood, I recall that we did not get along. I won't get into specifics...but going from a physical and mental abuse,  into a new type of mental abuse was rough. I was too different and not \"normal\".\n\n\n\nAt some point in my 20s, I separated myself from my now family. Life was like a blur. I drank, smoked, drove recklessly. Got tickets, flunked college, worked endlessly. Almost to the point that I thought my childhood was just a distant nightmare.\\\\ It took a lot of soul searching and expanding my social circle to other people but...eventually my new family and I rekindled. I wanted to appreciate and understand that...maybe they had a reason for the way they talked to me. Almost to a point that I don't recognize myself and the new personality that I developed just to look \"normal\".\n\nWas it acceptance? Did I understand and processed enough of what happened? Suddenly flashbacks of the distant nightmares came back. Any small negativity triggers my body into a frenzy state. Violent movies sent my heart racing as I flinch at every contact of a fist. Bloody sights causes eyes to turn away. Acts of drowning and struggles in water causes me catch my breath for air, as I unconsciously shove my feet into the ground...hoping it's still solid.\n\nI had done therapy as a child. Child services required it iirc. It didn't work for me at the time. I was too closed off for it to have any effect. In my adulthood,  as I'm struggling to \"fix myself\", I figured I'd give therapy another try. I already understood what I was going through...the difficulties I was facing...yes I know...\n\nSomething about the professional assessment of my state and diagnoses put me at ease. Ah...years of being called dramatic, unruly, disobedient, a slew of other things finally felt acknowledge to me. I wasn't crazy.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you for reading my story ☺️", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768020813.0, "id": "1q8v1xp", "author": "Suzurei", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8v1xp/hi_i_am_new_herewould_anyone_care_to_see_my_story/"}

I broke it off tonight after he keeps saying everything but breaking up with me, q because he just kept pushing me. I tried to explain why i needed space, how it wasn't his fault, I'm not mad or anything just really not ok. I've said it over and over again. He then will continue to defend himself from my \"attack\", about how that's so wrong. Not acknowledging the fact that I'm bawling, telling him my life is falling apart and I'm drowning, I just need space! I needed it because I didn't want to lose it on him because I was triggered and I knew it wasn't his fault!! I told him it wasn't his fault, lets pick it up again in the morning. So I ended up frantically trying to make him feel better, all while he was upset with me because his ego is bruised because he wants to be the one to help me..? I just don't know how I ended up here. \n\nI'm in crisis in my life because of events outside of my control that are happening, and he doesn't understand that my triggers are not his fault. I don't get upset with him, because I know it's not his fault. I've done some serious work in the last 2 years to get here. \n\nThis is day 4. Every word I've said has been wrong. He says I'm criticizing him, attacking him, now this is not the man I've known. I know it's only 3 months and we don't know each other that well yet, he's just turned so cold. He was so caring, it's like a switch flipped. If I had told that man in the beginning that what he was doing or saying was hurting me, he would have been beside himself. I've told him what I needed, a million different ways in the last 4 days. I've apologized a million ways from subway, validated his feelings and how my shit affects him. He just keeps saying he doesn't know how to help me. So I took it to the internet to try to find a better way of explaining what i need, he said that now my words weren't genuine. \n\nBut this is day 4. I can't breathe. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can barely work. He just wouldn't drop anything. Things would cool down and I could speak again but then he would just continue blaming me so then I would go back into triggered and here I am. It was honestly so incredibly confusing. \n\nI couldn't keep defending myself, not when my kids need me, and I need to work through this crisis. I can't do that when I'm fearing for my life because I'm triggered. \n\nI just don't understand. I'm not expecting to be allowed to treat him like garbage, I'm super aware of how I speak to him and the words I use, I feel so dismissed. I speak to him respectfully, saying how i feel not that he's done something, I'm exhausted. I just asked for space. He told me I changed. The day the crisis happened. Well, you think?! \n\nHe told me to speak to my counselor. Then wanted to know what meds I'm on. In the middle of this. Like when I can't form words but please let me disclose the darkest parts of myself to you because it will make you feel better right now. I told him it felt like he was going to use it against me, that he was asking at this moment. He told me I'm avoiding. Lord.\n\nI've been seeing my therapist weekly, fyi. For 2 years. I'm not lacking in support or education on my behavior, and I take my meds regularly. They do help. I have great relationships at work and family, though my work is insanely stressful, one thing people would never call me is unkind. \n\nI'm  having a shitty couple of days, and when my bf doesn't even acknowledge that I'm crying and hurting and just tells me it'll get better! I'm playing board games! Instead of just being like hey, what do you need? Or hey, I see you're not ok. But instead nothing, and I got hurt by it so kindly asked for the night, let's talk again in the morning. I can't believe that's what started this. Here is the exact text I sent him:\n\nI love you and I appreciate that you're trying to make me feel better but it's doing the opposite my love. I'm gonna take the night to deal with myself and the rest of this nightmare, but I'll text you in the morning 💖\n\nThere's so much more to it that's happened after that. I just kept pleading with him to just stop, maybe give me some grace, I'm not perfect but I'm not the monster he was treating me as. He kept saying he's a good person, it's better to stay positive, what are you gonna be like this forever? I don't want to be with someone that just sits in their depression. Everything just felt like such a knife to the gut. I'm incredibly positive, like what?!\n\nAnyone have an opinion? I could use some perspective. Maybe a kind word. \nI'm so hurt, please be gentle if you tell me I'm the problem. I'm happy to accept if I am. I know it's not easy being with someone like me, but i thought i was a really good person. Now I just don't know again.  I'm back to thinking I'm the problem. But then my brain says otherwise, so I'm so confused! I feel like my ptsd won. \n\nAnd I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense, I'm fairly emotional.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "I'm so tired.", "text": "I've posted my story before, then deleted it out of fear.. but i want to post it again\n\nThere's a lot.\n\nTw: Physical Abuse, Emotional abuse, verbal abuse, sexual assault, grooming, manipulation, stalking, domestic abuse, threats, kidnapping, suicide, animal abuse, neglect \n\n\n\n\nI was born into a house of domestic abuse. My dad was severely abusive towards my family, especially my mom. From what I've been told, he would gaslight her, acream scream scream - and hold in her choke holds and shake her. Hold her by the hair and shake her violently. He would chase her with a car, with my twin and I in the car, threatening to run her over and kill her.\n\nOne day, he swung her around jn a choke hold, and nearly killed her. He caused permant damage, so that was the day we all left, for our safety. I wish that was the end of my story - but that's just the beginning. My dad wasn't about to let us go that easily .\n\nSo, he began to stalk and follow my mom everywhere. At her job, at places she went too- hed find her. He made countless Facebook accounts to keep messaging her, threatening her, etc. Eventually this was brought to court - for custody wise, for my sister and I\n\nThis went on for months. During this time, my mom would let us visit him sometimes at restaurants, or schools. But, with this, came rhe kidnapping attempts. He trapped my sister and I in a trunk and tried to drive away-  but other people stood infront of the car to stop this. This happened many times, until he wasn't allowed to see us until the court thingies were decided \n\nThis made him so much angrier. He went to my mom's job one day and tracked her down and screamed at her, threatened her and said she stole us from him. The police had to escort him out abd he didnt get charged for anything. They said it was his mental health \n\nHe made hundreds of drawings of my mom hung in a tree and him holding hands with my twin and I, the three of us smiling. He wanted her dead. He wanted to kidnap us. We were in danger.\n\nThis is when my mom met my stepdad and she often left us home alone with my older sister (half sis but I just call her sister(, and brother, my older sister only being around 16 - when there was a man the loose wanting my mom dead, probably willing to have my older sister and brother dead, and my twin and I kidnapped.\n\nThis became a regular, and my older sister had to step in to raise us, pretty much. When my stepdad started to come over, she still had to raise us, and do a lot of stuff my mom should've done, not her. \n\nThe court decided- my dad would get my twin and I, unsupervised, every weekend. My dad's family all took his side, either not wanting to step in, or blantly saying my mom was a liar.\n\nThis is when that abuse and control started for my sister and I, for the next few years. My mom abd stepdad got married, and my older sister moved out at 18. \n\nShe often had to watch us, so my mom and stepdad could have sex, so she was still forced to raise us, as my mom slowly faded into the background. And, according to my sister, my mom, grew mean too. She would yell, she forced my twin to pick up spilled glass with her bare hands, she threw our toys all around once.  And she was working 3rd shift so we barely saw her.\n\n... that's when my stepdad started to give me attention. And gifts!!! Dad was hurting me, mom barely saw me- so I clung onto the love I DID get. This went on, until one day, he raped me. He told me not to tell anyone, so.. I didnt \n\nI dreamed off the assault for months after. Wet the bed. Knew stuff I shouldn't. Found stuff I shouldn't. And I never told a soul, until I eventually repressed it. \n\nMy dads abuse grew worse. He would hold uo by our necks, lift us up by our hair and shake us and drop us and hit us. He would call us slurs, call us cry baby's, call us a million terribke words, that I cannot name them all. He would hit our dog, mango, to scare us. \n\nHe would threaten to break up with his girlfriend (who he also abused, and who we also adored(, when we argued, so we'd stop. He would take away our food and ket us starve, if we whined. He would lock me in dark rooms, if I was \"bad\", he would threaten to kill himself. He threatened that God would kill him. He threatened me i would burn in hell forever if I didnt apologize for everything. For every single mistake\n\nHe would call me weak.\n\n\nAfter after moment of abuse, he'd isolate himself and cry. I followed him, and.. let him vent. He said he was a terrible dad that deserved to die, and that he'd go to hell, and that he should die. \n\n...I knew his mental health was bad.\n\nI always comforted him and begged him to pray, even as I was in pain, even if my throat was sore from crying and screaming and wailing. I still wanted to //help//\n\nHe died, 2019. Allergies \n\nI stayed  with just my mom and stepdad after this. My stepdad grew emotionally abusive, often insulting my body, my worth, everything. Slowly, this abuse made my repressed memories of the assault come back... and also the grooming.\n\nDuring the emotional abuse, where he would be belittled me, my worth, my body, where he'd accuse me of lying and yell at lot, a part of me started to crave that kindness I once had, even if it WAS grooming, because it was still love.\n\n My mom changed, too...she got more neglectful for me. She would always bring my sister and stepdad to the doctor, but never me. I was always overreacting, just had anxiety, etc - even the time I was sick for weeks, to the point I nearly collapsed. \n\nShe laughed at me when I begged her to stop smoking by me because I was getting bullied for it and my breathing was getting bad. She screamed at me whenever I had anxiety attacks infront of her, and even went as far to \"agree\" with my anxiety which made it worse\n\nWhen I cried, she yelled. When I made a mistake, she called me slurs and terrible words. Eventually, my twin and I tried to move to my sister's for a week for our health, and when my mom found out she gaslight me asking what we did wrong, asking why we hate her, etc\n\nThis became her habit. She says stuff like \"I hope you remember this when you're older\", \"youre lucky im not abusive\", \"kids would be happy to have your life,\" \"you don't have trauma\" and stuff like this. It was getting.. overbearing \n\n\nMy stepdad turned nice again. He gave me attention, gifts, money, books important to him and played songs about sex while driving me to school, and I.. grew attached, again. A kind within the storm.\n\nOctober 6th, 2024... it all got too be too much. So... I attempted. I got scared after and went to the hospital with my mom... and she made it about herself. \n\nShe joked with the doctors. Told them she told me to get therapy and I had refused ahd laughed and said \"SHE IS NOW!!!\" (she never told me to get therapy, lol), she told me I'm lucky to have her because she had nothing. She used it as an excuse to reinforce that \"your stepdad loves you\" (she has excused his emotional abuse), she even took the heart reading thing on my finger to show the doctors her heartbeat. They didnt stop her. They laughed, too... she also forced me to say no when they asked if I was abused at home. And she made it seem like it was my older sisters fault. \n\nShe was angry the way home. Yup... \n\nI attempted 5 more times after that, now all silent because of how my suicide attempt was treated.\n\nThen, I found out the truth of my dad, that my mom hid from my twin and I. My dad killed himself. Since then, I haven't been able to rid of the guilt, since he relied and vented to me, showed signs and I didnt do anything, and he died.\n\nI got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, anxiety, depression and I forgot the others.\n\nMy moms neglect grew worse. She and my twin argue a lot, and I hate it. She uses me for her vent source. I hate it.\n\nMy stepdad stopped the kindness Eventually, he's just.. content now. Casual. My mom has made it clear i can't go to her about the sexaul assault because she has chosen him over the emotional abuse, over when he attacked my brother, over when he was transphobic to his kid,  when he made sexual jokes to his kid and that family cut him off. She told me if i ever get groomed, she'd be so mad and angry with me.\n\nSo, she isn't a safe space. I told my therapist tho, since I'm 18 she can't report. \n\n\nI still live with my step-dad, and recently this has triggered my trauma every single day. I have daily panic attacks, I'm always on edge, sometimes I'm shaking, I struggle to eat, I can barely sleep, I'm scared, anxious, I disassociate for hours every day, I'm scared of it happening again, I have flashbacks every day, I remember how it felt and tasted, every day, I have to curl up in a ball to protect myself from the memories. Its.. difficult \n\n\nSo that's my story - and that doesn't include all the bullying, friend abandonment, lies, online manipulation, the amount of people who used me for their own benefit online, the ex online friend who threatened to kill me and harass me for months, the many times ive been in dangerous situations, when I got set on fire, when I almost drowned, the car accident, etc- all of that\n\nI'm tired. I'm barely making it through senior year I'm so so tired... I feel so heavy, and depressed, anx i want to cry. I want the memories to stop. I want to stop being scared. I don't wanna be a burden ", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768018416.0, "id": "1q8u97c", "author": "DawnZoid", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8u97c/im_so_tired/"}

No use fighting what you can’t change. \n\nOnce I free up my emotions from being stuck on the past, I bring my attention back to the present and future. What I can control in the present to feel safe. What I’ve learned is the majority of C-PTSD symptoms come from not being present. Either being consumed with what has already happened, or what will happen. You have to teach your mind and body that you are in the here and NOW. \n\nSome ways I’ve been doing this are:\n\n“Voo” chanting \n\nMeditating with one hand on heart, one on stomach \n\nBinaural beats, thunderstorm sounds, or other pleasant sounds that soothe my nervous system (I like marbles clacking together or water dropping) \n\nCo-regulating with my partner or dogs through eye contact (grounds me/stops dissociation) and cuddling (warmth and hearing their breathing &amp; heartbeat makes me feel safe and has a nice calming rhythm) \n\nMinimizing screen time\n\nGoing outside for walks or even just to sit and breathe \n\nStar/moon gazing (takes my breath away and fills me with a sense of gratitude for being alive despite all the bad that have happened) \n\nUnfollowing/unsubscribing to anything online or IRL that is negative or triggering \n\nSimilarly, minimizing contact with anyone who triggers my symptoms. My in-laws are these people. They may not have caused my C-PTSD, but they sure as hell do a lot of the same shit that the people who did do. You don’t even need a “good enough” reason. Listen to what your body is telling you at all times but ESPECIALLY around others. If your body is saying “no” to them, listen. I did not respect my body’s signals for a long time and developed chronic hives from stress. Only ever break out around my family or my in-laws. Not a coincidence. \n\nNo big lights on. I’ve had only my Christmas tree lights on, nightlights, and a red light projector on for the last month or so. The cozy lighting makes me feel safe. Especially in winter (most of my traumas happened this time of year) when my body goes into a freeze state.\n\nHobbies, bonus points if they’re not on your phone. I’ve been playing my Switch, doing LEGOS and puzzles, and other crafts. They distract me from my symptoms \n\nWhen my brain won’t shut up, I put on a podcast. It gives me something interesting to listen to while I shower or clean or do other boring tasks. \n\nI try to challenge my thoughts when I catch them come up. If I start replaying an event or fantasizing about confronting my abusers, I say out loud “STOP” and then I ask “is this helpful?”. Then I try to redirect my thoughts to something productive or positive. \n\nI watch a lot of content or movies and shows of families. Not toxic ones. That makes it worse. Wholesome ones. It heals my inner child \n\nI talk to my partner about what’s going on in my head and she holds space for me. \n\nControversial but I’ve just started meds finally to address the insomnia, anxiety and depression I’ve been dealing with from CPTSD. I can’t say how well it’s working because it’s only day 3. It does feel good to have a professional I can go to who has treated other people with our condition \n\nSomatic therapy. This one is huge and I haven’t gotten too far into it. But essentially it’s just releasing the stored trauma in your body through movement such as yoga or massage. This one helps me a lot when I actually do it. You’re basically opening your body up through these practices, and that rewires your brain to feel safe despite the flashbacks. \n\nI’ve heard great things about EMDR but haven’t tried it yet \n\nHumming!!! Sounds strange but it stimulates your vagus nerve and helps you feel safe. I do this one all the time. It’s great cause you can do it almost anywhere and it doesn’t require much effort. \n\nWhen feeling unsafe to yourself or others, seek help. Don’t be afraid to check yourself in if you need to. The world needs you here. \n\nThere are more things I probably can’t think of but hopefully this was a good starting list for you. In essence, do anything that is a healthy distraction, and move through your emotions through physical movement or expression (art, music, talking to a friend, crying, laughing). \n\nI hope you find relief🤍", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1768046949.0, "id": "nyrvp2u", "author": "kalekitty222"}

I want to share my story exactly as it happened.\n\n⸻\n\nHe was born to a kind, clumsy woman. His father left before he was born. They struggled for about two years—just him and his mom. On days she couldn’t afford a babysitter, he would go to work with her. She was young, just starting life, and didn’t know the world yet. So when she met him, her whole world lit up.\n\nHe was a con man and a delinquent, and they fell in love. Eventually, they got married. He never could have guessed how it would turn out. He eventually had a sister and could see a beautiful devil in her eyes. They grew up together and fought constantly, but they were close.\n\nIt wasn’t all happy childhood memories, though. The stepfather was violent when he drank—and he drank a lot. Then he had more children: there were four in total, including him. The childhood was rough, but the teenage years got even rougher. The stepfather became more violent over time, and what was worse, he took a disturbing liking to his daughter—a liking no father should ever have. That made him sad, though he didn’t understand why at the time. He wouldn’t fully understand until much later in life.\n\nThey moved around constantly, never having a permanent home. This made him feel like he had no safe place. When he got to high school and met her, he instantly fell in love. She was beautiful but dangerous—a delinquent herself.\n\nHe started down a different path than he should have. He began street racing before he even had a learner’s permit, just to have money for food or a game he wanted. He also did other things to survive—things he will never forget but does his best to push down. Eventually, he tried drugs. He shouldn’t have, but he loved it. They made him forget the things he had done and gave him a blissful escape. He smoked, drank, and numbed the pain as best he could, doing whatever he needed to survive, legal or otherwise.\n\nEventually, he dropped out of school in his third year and started working for gangs and less-than-savory people. Years passed, and he eventually got tired of the life he was living. He stopped. He put everything down and walked away. The withdrawals from that life almost killed him, but he pushed through.\n\nHe went back to school, got his GED, and even started college. That’s where he found her—the best mistake of his life. She was an old fling from high school, and they hit it off. They got married. He saved her from a rough situation and took care of her. For the first time, he had someone to care about. He was happy. Yeah, they never had it easy, but they were together, and for a while, it was good.\n\nThey started saving, bought a car, and were about to buy a house. But life always comes when you least expect it. There was a car accident that took everything from him—his home, his car, his job, and his health. But not her. She stuck with him. They had to move in with family. It sucked, but it worked.\n\nEventually, though, distance grew between them. She cheated and left him for another man. He was devastated. He couldn’t get out of bed. And then he found out he had cancer. It broke him. He had no fight left. Her family started harassing him, pushing him further, and now he doesn’t know where to go from here.\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768017985.0, "id": "1q8u3v6", "author": "Fun-Honey5024", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8u3v6/i_want_to_tell_you_a_story/"}

I normally remember some of my dreams, I have words, language, a way to describe the dream, some images (it's a thing I\"m doing now) ........but there was nothing......no images, no words, nothing. I couldnt make my mind form words and my mind was blank.\n\nMy subconscious was frozen, the same way I froze when I was born to a Mother who had zero empathy , zero maternal instinct, and no remorse for her abhorrent behavior.   I felt like someone reached in, and pulled me back in time.\n\nWhen He said that I felt like he was looking right through me, to my past.   Like he knew the worst part of my abuse, WAS the second part.  Something Ive been struggling to process all my life.  That my Mother , did NOT care if I was in Pain.   Not that I know, but I'm pretty sure  Mothers are supposed to care if their child is in pain?\n\nIt's interesting how as a child, or adult, how you don't allow yourself to see it, or know it.  How you dont' let yourself know somehow something so blatantly obvious ..... how cruel and indifferent your parent is.  No matter how unloving they are, you tell yourself its you asking for  too much, asking for something that obviously doesnt exist the way you think it should exist, and maybe this version of \"Love\" this callous , heartless, cruel, abrasive, unloving, indifferent, emotionally neglectful, unkind version of love.............is love?.   But if it was love, then why would you have to numb yourself and hide yourself whenever you were around your Mother?   Why would this \"love' scare you?  Why would this love require you feel nothing?  Be nothing?    A therapist told me \"love is safe\", I thought 'whats' safe?\"\n\nWhen you grow up without love, you know you don't feel good, but I couldnt get my mind around why I felt so bad, nor could I make the connection between my depression and pain, and the way My Mother was unloving and cruel.  It's never them, it's always you being sad for no reason, and who cares anyway?  No one.\n\nI developed a very high tolerance for despair.  High tolerance means  you just endure.  You stop looking for consolation.    Since, no one cared, took action, amended their behavior, sought to comfort me, then I must obviously either be fine , or I deserve the pain.\n\nBecause every time  you admit you feel pain, sad, abandoned, depressed you end up hating yourself , or your engulfed with shame, when you go looking for love and compassion and its met with indifference, and callousness.    It's dangerous to admit to yourself that youre feeling anything painful, hurtful, when the support and love  you seek that never comes to your aide, is a constant reminder of how unlovable you are.  Your humanity becomes your worse enemy.\n\nThe Shame of being faced with a loveless uncaring parent is intolerable.   And every time your human need for love comes up, your hating  yourself more and more, when you should be hating them.\n\nThe shock is starting to wear off a bit.  I'm starting to feel really..........*angry. Like scary angry.*\n\nMy body is slowly starting to unravel it.   Why I froze my feelings, why it wasn't' safe to admit I felt anything.  I wanted to scream, I wanted to throw something for being born to such a horrific parent and being powerless.\n\nIt was too horrible to feel that bad around someone-a parent,  who cared that little.  You dont' call them a psychopath, you call yourself nothing.\n\nIt wasn't safe to react to the pain, to the abuse, because I knew what would happen......................After.  Either a look of indifference, amusement, or pleasure.   Some vague sense of letting me, know who was in charge.   The dominant stance.

I was like, 16, working at a pizza joint. Like, my shift lead was more emotionally considerate than my own fucking mother was. Random drivers hanging out in the back were parenting me better than she could.\n\nAnother time she did it, when I told her about my SA, and she cried violently and made me comfort her because she was so broken up about how it could happen to me. She eventually got really angry ans threatened to have that abuser killed, like planning to actually go out and do it and talking about hiring someone to do it, which made me freak out and I actually had to get someone to get in touch with my abuser because I was legitimately worried she was going to start stalking him! I found out that day im absolutely opposed to the idea of vigilante justice, to say the least. I just wanted some like, emotional support?? To be told it wasnt my fault and she was on my side, but no. I hate my abuser, but I dont want him to die for the crime he committed against me, and I cant understand why she would think I wanted that? Or that it was ok for her to say that to me?

When things are positive, you’re usually too busy enjoying life to notice how your body is feeling! - Or maybe that’s just me, my therapist says I’m terrible at noticing the sensations in my body (which is common for those of us with CPTSD).", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768032637.0, "id": "nyr5g4q", "author": "ImpossibleMoon2642"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "I want to have any kinds of suggestions or resources to overcome my past childhood trauma.", "text": "Hi👋😊. Hope your days are going fine.\nA little bit about myself: I am Southeast Asian Male and will be 22 this year and I am trying to overcome one of my very lasting childhood trauma till this day. I was born in a not so strict conservative family environment but both my parents are quite open-minded persons. But as far as I remember, these open-minded things doesn't come until I was late teen around 17 or 18, like that. Everything was not so controlled by my parents until I was 18. This is just a little bit but, hope you will get the idea. Now, here's how my trauma begins.\n1. So when I was around 10 or 11, I really did got shocking experience. On the night of my middle school promotion exam night which is to go from standard 4 to standard 5 while I was still studying, my father and mother got into verbal arguments whether they use quite a lot rude words to each other in my mother tounge. The reason for them to argue is that my mother accused my father of cheating and something like that. And the conversation got so heated that they are smashing thigs around them. One of the shattered piece from the mug, scratched my forehead a little bit coz we have really small house so I was doing my stuy in the main room and they are arguing in the hallway to the kitchen. After some time, they stopped and told me to just sleep.Ofc, they treated my wound since it was not that serious, they just did first-aid and then told me to sleep and they also slept separately that night. In the morning, my father take me to outside to have breakfast and I did my quick revision on the way to the exam. After the exam finished around noon, we (My father and I)came back to home found that my mother was no where to be seen coz she's living with her parents. \nThat thing last for almost one year but they finally back together after some spoking and resolving. But the household was not the same as anymore from that day onwards, there is little little arguments (where they use quite rude words) over the times. Until big thing happened.\n\n2. This happened the same thing also, on my promotion exam for the senior high school year; promoting for standard 8 to standard 9 and I will be around 14 or 15. The same pattern, on the night of my final exam day the argument suddenly broke out being with the same case accusing of each other cheating. It was so heated coz even the police got even involved, my mother called her family over to defend her in case of my father suddenly becoming violently. But fortunately there was nothing serious happened but for very first time in my life, I felt broken. Coz on that night, the conversation got so heated that they even started talking about divorcing and stuff like that and later my mother a d her family brought my youngest sibling to their house on that night after asking the me and my younger sibling the smae question whether do we want to go with them? We said no but my youngest sibling did know that much since he's still around 10 so they just simply took him away. After that, me, my younger sibling slep. In the morning we went to my exam and come back and have lunch and rest for day. And do you know how the rest of our summer holidays went? We were not allowed to see our youngest sibling. I don't care what happened between adults but why restrict us also? You know what they said?, They afraid that my youngest sibling will come and live with us. Those kind of things are quite stupid things to say to us children. Yes, they really treated us differently. Like, they do not even welcome us anymore to their houses. They looked with us with disgusting eyes coz we didn't not go with them when they called us on the night of my exam date. These separation between siblings last one year straight. Being the eldest for my siblings do you think I can handle for my age? No, but I tried to do it anyway coz I cannot fixed my environment so I tried to fixed myself. From that onwards, both my parents tried to slaunder each other through newspaper even. For the very first time in my life, my father cried in front of us and he told us every thing from their marriage until these day(While I got a chance to listen tomy father side story but never get chance from my mother side) Even till, today sometime I felt, I was adopted coz as far as I remember I never felt like I was loved truly by our parents despite being the eldest. But I never question them about because we did family blood test one time because we all have the same blood type so I thought it can nerver happened. \n\n3. Throughout my these childhood experiences, my attitude, lifestyle behavior changes quite a lot. There were times, when I really tried to k*ll my cousins, even siblings with a knife and yes I really did grab a knife and run towrds but the adults stopped me from doing that entirely. But you know, no one literally no one my parents did even consult me with why I did that. Even now when I thinking back, I really deserve to be dead. Why was I thinking like that. I couldn't comprehend myself till these days. So to overcome, and foget everthose memory, I started addicted to p*rn after my second trauma happened. It last me a very long and become my habbits that I am trying to overcome that thing this year and I am trying to seek some additional help to overcome. Coz because of these things my social life till this days not so good. I regret getting addicted on that which makes me loses interest in the things I like to do when I was happy young and active child. And This is my very first time opening up coz I have been carrying this for a very long time and I know I have to eventually let it go but I need help in over coming this. \nI have cut so many scenarios that is causing me traumising but these two are most haunting me that's why I would like to seek some help or resources to get over.\nI'm sorry, if I am not conveying my messages in the way you might understand. but I hope you will get the idea.  \nMany Thanks", "score": 4, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768014449.0, "id": "1q8sw8u", "author": "Dramatic_Salad_8953", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8sw8u/i_want_to_have_any_kinds_of_suggestions_or/"}

Although, if anyone has any opinions or advice I would genuinely be interested to hear it. Thanks\n\nWhen I was relatively young I dealt with online grooming which lead to sexual trauma due to my low self-esteem where I went further looking for validation. Due to this, I felt little urge to initiate or develop romantic relationships as a teenager or later.\n\nAt 19 a close friend told me she had a crush on me. I am a lesbian, but I was not particularly attracted to her - Regardless, my immediate instinct was to accept and reciprocate. (I proceeded to chug the rest of my beer and say 'We can date then if you want'. Not my most romantic moment.)\n\nI felt extremely validated that she found me attractive, and confident that I would eventually grow to also find her attractive. She was kind and pretty, so it didn't seem like it would be too difficult. This was also at a peak point of a binging/eating disorder period I went through, so I was heavily influenced by other people's opinions of me - To hear she found me attractive was honestly surprising. \n\n2 years and a half we dated and I consistently struggled to both understand how she found me attractive and to maintain consistent attraction to her. I found it difficult to keep up sexually with her high sex-drive and would frequently fake orgasms just to get it over with. \nI understand that this doesn't paint a particularly healthy image of our relationship, and it likely wasn't particularly healthy inwardly for me - but outwardly I was supportive and affectionate. I genuinely tried to be the partner I could be and I was mostly happy. Like a pendulum, there were moments where I would swing up and feel entirely content within the relationship and be eager to reciprocate romantically/sexually but eventually the pendulum would swing back down and I would start to struggle again.\n\nTowards the end of the relationship, I started going to the gym and actively focusing on my appearance, mental-health and weight-loss. I dropped several sizes and gained some confidence. \nWe had been long distance for the last year due to going to different university placements and I was starting to feel overwhelmed with both my workload as well as maintaining a relationship. I broke up with her citing this as the reason and it was amicable and we remain friends.\n\nIf I am totally honest, we broke up because I struggled to maintain a healthy facade for the relationship and often felt emotionally exhausted after having dealt with friends/work and then having to communicate with her on the phone. She preferred to text/call for hours, and I felt forced to respond quickly so she wouldn't become upset - I was never rude or dismissive, but I would sometimes lie and say I was going to gym/had overtime so that I wouldn't have to be on my phone to respond. This was clearly a communication issue on my part.\nDue to shame I have never actually told anyone about my trauma - It didn't feel severe enough and I didn't want to affect my parents/friends. I realise now it likely would've been beneficial to tell my girlfriend about it, but I dont know how I would've even have begun the conversation if I had.\n\nI'm now 21 and I guess I'm struggling to understand where to go from here, I know I ultimately need to work on my mental-health but I still sometimes feel sexual/romantic urges and I find it difficult to understand how best to act on them healthily.\nI often feel I become so obsessed with the way that my sexual trauma has affected me that it prevents me from actively allowing myself to get better/seek solutions", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768011648.0, "id": "1q8rvdf", "author": "International-Fig561", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8rvdf/struggling_to_communicateinitiate_adult/"}

It was so intense that my eyelids had bleeding marks and my entire face was swollen up for days. I had two retake tests in uni during the Christmas holidays which made me very stressed. After my final test I came home exhausted from everything. The next day my bf ended up breaking off our 4 years relationship and that was the final straw. \n\nThe past 9 days I’ve been extremely depressed. I haven’t been able to have a proper night sleep since the first day of January. I’ve been thinking about every single issue that has ever happened in my life. I’ve been dealing with really weird nightmares and I’m really not myself, as if something took out my entire normal functioning brain and body. The past few days I’ve thought about what went right and wrong in my life and where I was the problem and where I wasn’t. \n\nThe past two days I messaged a few people from my past to apologize for certain things I’ve done or didn’t handle properly. Most reactions were positive except for one but that was mostly a her problem. This made my body lighter, for the first time in years. A feeling I haven’t had in years. \n\nI also put aside some past issues that I had no control over because I was a child and teenager. I didn’t know what I could’ve done better because I wasn’t mature enough to deal with all that. For the first time in my life, I accepted it. Literally all of it. And I feel so relaxed physically and also mentally. \n\nI think my bf and I will most likely reconcile after a while because he has his own issues and has the tendency to be a drama queen if he doesn’t get enough attention from me. I will leave this up to destiny for now. \n\nFor now, I need to accept the fact that some very heavy stuff happened in my past. I went to therapy for years but this whole month of self reflection on my own helped me more than anything before. I’m almost 24F and I think life has a lot of positive things ahead of me because I survived my past. Which means I am strong enough to deal whatever comes now because the past is in the past, it shouldn’t even matter anymore.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Performance anxiety during sex tw.graphic", "text": "Mentions of:CSA,Sexual Activity,Assault\n\nI haven’t had sex in like 7 months. I want to but I am so anxious. I’m 18 now but the trauma from my childhood is just getting increasingly difficult to cope with. And everytime I have had sex it’s been a big amount of anxiety for me the memories of what happened being a big part but also the anxiety of doing good.\n\nI almost feel like I’m performing and not fully in the moment. Huge trigger warning as to why I think this could be because it’s quite graphic. But the rapes started when I was 8. It would happen frequently sometimes multiple times a day.\n\nI would have to be into it. If I wasn’t I’d be “punished”. Especially at the start or if we’d already done it multiple times I would cry. Or push the rapist away. Or ask if we could do something else like watch porn which we sometimes did. If I did that or my rapist could tell I wasn’t enjoying it I’d get hit,punched,strangled. And the rape was more painful.\n\nIf I complied and I guess “performed” acting like it was so good even when it wasn’t half the time and moaned and talked sexually I was being “good”. And I’d be rewarded by the rapist doing it so it felt good or at least didn’t hurt. But if I didn’t perform well enough making sure to show I “like it” or didn’t want to or cried the rapist would attack me do it in my butt. Didn’t make sure I was lubed with vaginal stuff because I didn’t really produce much usually on my own because yeah obviously I was so young. So it would just be dry and painful.\n\nAnd if I cried during the punishments my rapist would make it extra painful and extra drawn out until I pretended it felt good even though I was in extreme pain or discomfort. Often I would just not even feel like I was there just so I could get through it. Like a dream like state. I still knew what was going on and stuff and interacted but I wasn’t fully there.\n\nNow when I have sex I feel the need to do it perfectly. I get anxious about if I’m doing a good job. Am I being sexy enough? Am I doing too much or too little dirty talk? Does this feel good to him? Am I being responsive enough? Honestly it’s like I’m filming a porn video rather than having sex.\n\nAnd sometimes Im just doing it on autopilot like I’m having sex but I’m just doing things without really even thinking. They’re not really for my pleasure more for him. And if I want to do something for my own pleasure like if something feels really good and I give instruction like to do a specific spot or speed I feel greedy. Like this isn’t about me. I should just be greatful he even agreed to have sex with me what’s wrong with me this is for him and if he feels good that’s a bonus.\n\nI also feel really inadequate and like I’m letting guys down if they like anal. I can’t do anal. I find it disgusting maybe because of the trauma but even the thought I just can’t. If a guy asks I feel awful because I have to say no. I guess I don’t have to but I really hate it. No guy has ever made me feel bad about not wanting to do anal sex but I feel bad. Because it’s not being compliant and perfect and stuff. Making him feel good.\n\nSome of the guys I’ve been with consensually are the sweetest people ever and really wanted to do it for both of our pleasure. They didn’t make me feel that way it’s a me thing. I just feel like I need to be perfect for him.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "That is terrible. The reason it's happening is probably because you are safe now. It was deep down inside but now you're nervous system may be saying hey ok I'm ready to deal with it now. Your able now to see what was unseen because it's time to begin healing. This is a good sign. But it's important to have guidance right now or you could retraumatize yourself. Learning to stay present through a flashback is an essential skill and it is a skill that can be learned. Staying present through a flashback and, importantly, coming out of it recognizing that you're still safe, this has the effect of demonstrating to your brain that there is no actual danger, only the echo of danger seared into your nervous system, and that will tell your brain that it doesn't need the full defensive response of actual danger. Doing that is a huge step forward. The flashbacks will get much easier the more you practice it. Practice saying to yourself \"I'm safe\" and look around the room and name five objects out loud. Do the 5 step grounding exercise, it works.\n\nBut that is just the beginning, you'll need to do something with the information you experience. It will need to be processed and become part of your own narrative. \n\nI believe in you. I hope you have some support through this journey.

The psychiatrist I was taken to on that same day we went for the first time after hearing me out told me that I had no real issues and that I just need to socialize more and go to the gym, which my parents agreed with. \nA while after that I opened by mistake to my mom and told her about how I got repeatedly SA'd as a child for months and it tore her and my dad up. I finally now told my parents that I want t\no go to a psychologist because I want to know more about myself and to help with how I act pertaining to what happened to me, they said yes begrudgingly and I thought the first session went well, that was until I made the mistake of telling them how my sensory issues like sitting in the closet may have something to do with trauma. I paid no mind to it until my mom saw me sitting in my closet reading my book, she freaked out, my dad heard it came and also freaked out, and went on for what seemed like hours while I dissociated not bothering to explain myself, telling me that everyone goes through something painful in their lives but they don't sit on it and do a self pity act while going nowhere forward in life and that he's not going to let me go to a psychologist again if she's making me think that doing something like this is normal that no one in the world would see me sitting in my closet and think that I was alright or normal. I thought that was the end of it and cooped up in my room until my mom came in and told me that she convinced him that I learned my lesson and that ill never do it again, telling me how he was worried. The following days until my next session I pretty much kept to myself not trying to talk to them more than I should and they accused me of being horrible to them, my parents of all people and that this is an overreaction. \nAfter my second session which I was allowed to attend things went fairly fine again until I asked my dad if he'll pay for my third session and he started telling me that I'm not getting any better and asking me again why I sit in the closet, I decided to give it a shot and explain myself because my psychologist suggested it, and he got upset and started it again telling me that I have no problems or issues, I may be a little traumatized but everyone has gone through something traumatic but they never wanted to claim it so badly until me, that he remembers that I tried saying I had ADHD and it was a mistake to go along with it because I like attaching myself to illnesses and thank goodness the previous psychiatrist shut me down.\n\nI'm starting to feel like I'm going crazy for thinking that this has started over a non issue, I feel like I made a big mistake opening up to them I don't feel okay and I don't think that people usually talk like this about someone's trauma.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767999932.0, "id": "1q8ndea", "author": "Even_Ad4940", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8ndea/am_i_crazy_for_thinking_that_my_csa_trauma_is/"}

So it’s all good and you can go on with your day, you did nothing wrong and it’s just one of those uncomfortable things that happen to everyone. \n\nIn other occasions, some probably did actually see you but chose to not respond to you. These are the people you need boundaries with. For example: never give these people your friendship. The problem is knowing which is which. \n\nIf some people seem valuable to you you could ask them about it, totally fair thing to do! \n\nBut also, if this continues over and over another thing you could consider is that you’re highly sensitive or very introverted. Which means that to you, you are talking louder and coming off clearer than you “actually are”. To others (non highly sensitive) you’re whispering and barely making a notice of yourself and so they don’t get a proper signal to respond to. This just means you need to connect to other sensitive people, because using an unnatural loud voice is going to feel really weird. \n\nBut yeah, never forget people can be shitheads:) that’s a very important life lesson.

Sometimes the type of self love I see touted as the gold standard seems to be unconditional self affirmation instead of unconditional self compassion. You may not always *feel* like you love yourself, you may not even like yourself most of the time. The unconditional self compassionate self love is respecting and protecting yourself even when you don't like yourself. That true love is making yourself a safe space for you. \n\nIt's not easy to build that self compassion. It is so slow and often unseen. I spent my childhood and especially my teenage years in a near constant state of self loathing. There are still days for me now that I fucking despise myself. The difference now is that I've built a foundation of love for myself. I recognize when I'm falling into the despair spiral and stop it before I start hurting myself. I can realize the pain of my inner child is doing the talking, and I can gently guide them and myself back to a state of being kinda okay. I know I can be upset with myself but I don't have to act on it. I can feel small but still refuse bad treatment. I take care of myself even when I don't want to, even when I feel like I don't deserve it. \n\nThat's the kind of love we all need for ourselves.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "I always feel like I'm the wrong one.", "text": "A common theme I've noticed throughout my life is that I have always subtly feel like the \"wrong one\". I felt consistently that way as a kid in my family. I was always too sensitive, too emotional, not hard working enough. Then I became hard working and started pulling straight As at school but the criticism continued. I ended up struggling a lot with perfectionism when it came to my grades as a result. At school, I was bullied a lot as a little girl. I was too quiet. I was unpopular. Before I started to become a straight A student, I was also called dumb at home but also at school and it somehow felt like everyone was in on \"it\". For the life of me I never did figure out what the actual fuck \"it\" was, you know? \n\nI am still not sure why people didn't really like me. I got excluded again and again from my friend group as a preteen and young kid. I never had a friend group beyond that point. I ended up going to high school with no friends but eventually made some mostly superficial relationships with others. But never had a friend group again. \n\nI think maybe I became more reserved as my perfectionism in school snowballed after 9th grade. But I've always been quiet and maybe that's the issue. I remember my mom asking me repeatedly as a kid if I say hi back to people when they greet me as if I'd eventually fess up and tell her I didn't and it would be a lightbulb moment for her like \"Aha! I have figured out why my daughter is so isolated with few if any friends! It's her fault!\". \n\nI also didn't really socialize much when I got to university. It was all studying like my life depended on it. And in a way, it did. The perfectionism was strong by then. I guess I can't be too hard on myself for that. It was hard growing up constantly and intensely being yelled at by a full grown man I call \"Dad\" for being \"stupid\" and having a \"lazy mind\". I graduated and left home as soon as I could at 23. I finally left the family unit that made me feel so wrong, too much and not enough at the same time. \n\nBut that feeling stuck. I find myself, 10y later, still feeling like I'm on the outside looking in in most aspects of my life and I can't seem to shake it. Even though I pretty much have all the trappings of a successful life. I own a property that is beautiful, comfortable and clean. My body is healthy and I am able to invest in the hobbies and things I value and enjoy because, financially, I can afford it and I have the spare time to do so. I have a career that earns me enough to be financially independent and comfortable and enough time off to enjoy all of it. I have all the things I worked really hard for because I couldn't expect anyone to help me because I've always known and felt like no one is really there for me so *I* have to be the one. And that is entirely reasonable. If not me, then who? Like what? Just fail because no one is there for me? That sounds dumb as fuck. If no one loves me or likes me then I am at least going to be that for myself so I can survive and succeed. I deserve that much. \n\nBut it doesn't change that I still feel so outside of everything and everyone. I watch coworkers around me make plans outside of work and comment on each other's social media and things. I did at one point feel like I was kind of getting close to these people but then for some reason, I started getting left out of things again. And it hurts pretty badly. I know I shouldn't care. These are coworkers, not friends. And I know why it hurts - because it mirrors what happened when I was too young dealing with too much for my age, I guess. \n\nI also run into some content online where people say \"well you're the common denominator, you're the problem\", \"people with few or no friends are red flags\". I get why someone would say that. And it makes me want to be defensive because I actually don't really understand what it is about me that has been so wrong my whole life that people just don't like me. And before anyone says - yes, I am aware that not everyone needs to like me. I am actually not a shitty person, I promise. I am also not asking for *everyone* to like me. But there really is something soul crushing walking around and feeling like there's really no tribe to be found for me, if you know what I mean. Can we not just honour that feeling for a little bit?

I also dissociate without really noticing and then forget many things. Especially if the stress has been going on for a long time.

It is a possibility so don't think this is all your fault. My partner usually notices before me when I get in a state like that (however he is not abusive). I'm worried for you, I can understand that this is scary for you.\n\nI hope you can leave soon. Can your therapist help finding strategies to deal with the memory issues until you are in a better position? Is it possible for you to focus on getting more sleep?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "I think I am losing my sanity", "text": "I've come to realize I don't live like a human. I don't feel human. In fact, I don't even see people as people. Explaining this fully would take pages, but let me try.\n\nI have no consistent, solid, or fundamentally \"human\" connection to anyone. Actually, let me correct that: to anything. Objects included. I don't feel anything towards anything.\n\nFor example, I have almost no emotional bond with my family. It's not that I'm angry at them or because they were abusive (though their parenting and actions are the reason for my current state). I just don't feel that sacred, familial tie.Even my innocent little sister doesn't \"mean\" anything to me. Remembering her doesn't stir anything inside. It's as if she's a fictional character.\n\nThis applies to all people. And not just living things—I have no emotional attachment to objects either. I own very few clothes. I've almost never bought clothes for myself. I wear my father's old clothes. That doesn't mean anything to me either.\n\nIt's as if I have no sense of belonging inside. The city I live in, my country, my family, my ethnic background—none of it seems to mean anything. More accurately, I doubt I see them as human. They feel like symbols to me.Because of that, I have no consistent or clear feelings towards them. People who have wronged me and whom I \"hate\"... I can only say I hate them when they're not around. But face-to-face, I can feel affection for them. It's a very strange dynamic.\n\nFurthermore, my connection to reality is quite distorted. Almost my entire day is spent in imaginary scenarios and fantasies. While resting, eating, or studying, I act as if someone is with me. I talk to them, sometimes taking it further—I assign them seating arrangements and converse accordingly. Sometimes I stop what I'm doing and wander around my house talking to them. These aren't just quirky or slightly \"off\" behaviors. Sometimes I spend 3-4 hours just walking around and conversing with these imagined people. I laugh at my own jokes, get angry at their actions, give them the silent treatment, have arguments with them. From the outside, it must look like someone is wandering in the dark inside the house—quite an experience for my roommate, lol.\n\nMy brain has thinned its connection to reality so much that when I create an alternative reality, even though I'm making up the story in real-time, my reactions are as if I'm living it. My responses feel completely natural, and I can add the most extreme details to the story effortlessly within seconds. I don't feel like I'm living it, though. Because sometimes I forget I'm completely alone at home. The difference between my roommate being home or not feels negligible to me.\n\nI also frequently pick up a knife and touch myself with it—press it against my wrist, touch my throat, just play with it. It feels like a normal activity. To be honest, I'm not even sure if I'm scared when I touch it to my wrist. Since I have no connection to myself either, I only feel a small, instinctive, purely biological flicker of fear—but no shock. I don't throw the knife down and think, \"What am I doing?!\" I create personas, personalities inside myself.\n\nSometimes, the scenarios I build are later remembered by my brain as actual events that happened. While building the scenario, I convince myself so well that I'm hallucinating that it later feels like I actually saw things.\n\nMy last post here advised me to \"avoid stress,\" but I don't get stressed. I'm completely neutral. I don't do these suicide \"rehearsals\" in anguish. I do them out of curiosity.\n\nMy history:I have raped 7-8 times by my cousin for 2 years.Emotional,financial and psychological abuse/neglect.\nI have witnessed and experienced severe Psychical brutality in primary school", "score": 10, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": 1767992309.0, "id": "1q8k3vr", "author": "Historical-Mix1944", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q8k3vr/i_think_i_am_losing_my_sanity/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Trauma affecting relationship", "text": "TWs: SA; abandonment; neglect; betrayal; general abuse.\n\n\n\nI am trying TRE (trauma release exercises) solo due to finances, and I don't know if I did it properly. I have constant muscle bracing, 24/7, and it really hurts. During TRE, I ask my body what it wants to say and I have a dialogue with myself. It has always lead to heavy emotions. The other day, the shaking got very severe and I had a visual flashback of a SA trauma. An urge to scream. Then, I cried. But it was like..as an observer? Like I felt okay. Not overwhelmed. Not out of control. I always disassociate during traumatic events. When I had ab urge to scream during TRE I didn't because I didn't want to scare my family and neighbors and my inner voice said, \"You won't let me release this.\" and the shaking became much more gentle. I felt bad and then I kinda resolved to release it and the shaking got severe again and I started crying. But as I was crying, I was still in the present and thought \"I'm so glad I'm crying and grieving this.\" My muscles became incredibly clenched afterwards. Protective, I suppose.\n\nSince then, my partner and I have had some friction from ongoing unresolved problems that trigger feelings from my past and I have been enraged and ruminating on my anger towards him. I will say, he is not abusive or mean at all. I just get triggered by him. I have tried to suppress it, but I am fuming. ​\n\nI feel like I am viewing him as a symbol of all of my pains and projecting the dynamic of victim and abuser onto him. I mean like..when we fight we aren't only fighting about what's between us. We are fighting my past. And I am fighting so hard because I never fought for myself before. It's become like a roleplay of me standing up for myself. Like he isn't my partner to me. He is every person who has ever hurt me. And I am standing up to them. \n\nBut I must explicitly say, he is not them. I am not in an abusive relationship. He is not cruel. He is not sadistic. He is not unfaithful. And yet, I get triggered and he becomes them. I feel like I'm insane in a way. Because I can't see him clearly much of the time. When I do, I want to cry, because I see his innocence. \n\nWe undeniably have problems. But he is a kind person. He has autism and demand avoidance. He tends to work too much. He tends to have inappropriate social boundaries. He tends to use distancing language when overwhelmed. This is what triggers me. Because they mirror my neglect, abandonment, and betrayal trauma. He doesn't trigger my other traumas. But I feel like I'm fighting the ghosts in my head. His behavior would bother a lot of people. But it makes me unglued. But he is a good man. I am afraid of losing him because knowing him is like going through a minefield of my trauma. But he's also helped me heal.​\n\nI woke up so full of hatred towards him today. \n\n  \nI just want to rest and feel safe. I want to feel loved consistently. He loves in a distant way.

And as a fellow perfectionist, it was… humbling… to be the worst in my class.  But, it’s helping me with accepting long projects don’t have immediate rewards like school did.  Now I’m trying sewing.  It’s a few levels higher on the perfectionism and anxiety scale than archery.\n\nI’ve had a lot of small steps.  Feeling a bit of anger every day because I couldn’t feel it at all due to childhood abuse.  Writing in a gratitude journal every day.  Doing one thing towards a goal every day, no matter how small, so I didn’t feel I was wasting my time.  Feeling a small part of an intense emotion daily.  Paying attention, for like 10 seconds at a time each, of what my eyes were seeing, my ears were hearing, and my body was feeling, to learn how to stop dissociating and being in the present.  Starting to notice when I create a pressure cooker of my emotions.  Finding little work arounds that help me do what I want to do, despite my body not wanting me to, like brushing my teeth.  Giving myself permission to wear the pretty clothes.  Even more importantly, giving myself permission to BUY pretty clothes, because I always had ugly ones.  Small meditations of keeping my mind blank, very small, like 30 seconds, but each day.\n\nBig one that was great and sucked was recognizing that I’m not always at fault.  In any relationship, there’s at least 2 people who share the blame, even if it’s 99.9% to 0.01%.  This is great for when I learned how to speak out.  It sucked for when I realized I can be right, and others will still paint me as at fault because they can’t see their own biases (which funny enough, I CAN see).\n\nGiving myself patience, grace, and kindness when I’m not progressing as fast as I want.  This one… oh boy.  There were many failures in this one.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1768007118.0, "id": "nype21n", "author": "i_am_soooo_screwed"}

You’re a human being worthy of love and belonging. \n\nFor me, developing the nervous system-level-understanding that cPTSD (shame/fear) is a nervous system state—not who I am—and that I’m the one who relates to my cPTSD, made a huge difference. I now notice symptoms instead of fusing with them in panic. Mindfulness helped with this. Mindfulness is a fancy word for noticing thoughts and feelings as separate from you (the one observing them).\n\nI did—and still practice—learning, one day at a time, to recognize my triggers, stay with my self when triggered, and engage with life and others to honor the gift it is to be alive—instead of trying to live life to prove I’m worthy of love and belonging. \n\nAt the core of my recovery is accepting that each of us are worthy of love and belonging an inherent gift—even if we didn’t experience that gift growing up. It’s been choosing to accept that truth—despite what shame tells me—and then treating myself as if it is true by caring for myself in a loving way that has made a big difference. One day at a time, one small set of actions at a time.\n\nI return to that truth when deregulated and calm myself. It’s a daily practice.\n\nEMDR helped, but consistently caring for myself, recognizing when I was deregulated (my needs weren’t being met), meeting those needs, and then choosing to engage with living in progressively bigger ways—without my worth being on the line—has also helped immensely. \n\nBeyond all of this, I choose to hold the belief that despite my suffering—and the suffering of those around me—that life is worth living. I choose to believe that Jesus Christ has experienced and overcome my suffering. It’s recognizing my relationship to God as His child that has solidified the core belief of being worthy of love and belonging.\n\nI still manage my cPTSD symptoms, but they’ve largely receded to the background. They’re on my brain bus, and I don’t try and kick them off, but they also aren’t steering nearly as often anymore. \n\nFinally, I’m 34.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "One a-ha has come to me through internal family systems therapy… To reparent your inner child. And that brought out the protective big sister and big aunt and mother in me that I needed as a child. And then I have turned that kind of energy in words towards myself. I am giving myself the things that I needed. And as I am doing that, I feel myself evolving. I feel the center of myself becoming stronger. I call it my heartwood. Because that is the densest middle part of the tree that grows so strong that the tree doesn't break - just bends a little bit - when there's a storm. \n\nComing out of my abusive childhood I was very porous. I was full of holes. I didn't have a solid identity that was stable. I had bits and pieces of myself but so much of how I thought and how I reacted was a trauma response. I was codependent, fearful, meek. I was so deeply alone inside of myself that I accepted really poor behavior from people in the early part of my adult life, after leaving that abusive childhood. And so I was a doormat at times and I got myself into painful situations at times. But I learned through each bad situation. I decided with each bad thing that happened that I didn't like it and I didn't want it in my life so I was going to do something different.\n\nOne small epiphany that I had when I was in my 20s and learning from these difficult situations where people hurt me… Was that I was not going to play the victim. Yes somebody might have hurt me and I could be angry about that and I could hold them accountable. But what I also had to do is take responsibility for how I let them. And that made me question myself and my interaction patterns. And I decided I didn't like these situations anymore. They tore me up. And so I began to try to change my interaction patterns. And I stopped letting people walk all over me because that's how I ended up in those bad situations. I started to listen to my gut more. I started to pay attention early to people's characters. I decided what I liked about people and kind of made a little bit of a list in my head. I like people who are genuine, and kind, and intellectually curious, and accepting of others, and funny… I love funny people. And so I evolved who I was making friends with and filling my life up with.\n\nThen, ultimately all of that growing led me to a period where I decided to live by myself. And during that time I've done the internal family systems work quite a bit. And I gotta say when I began that, being alone and living alone so much – it was in the pandemic – it was uncomfortable and painful. I got very depressed. I just moved to a new town so I didn't even have the comfort of all of my old friends. Though we did talk on the phone. But I moved through all of that, getting therapy, learning to think differently… And now I have grown into a person who knows the things that I want and need. A person that rises up in my own defense if something is unjust. And I have this calmness inside of me that no matter how much I love someone, if I have to lose them I'll still be OK. But I don't have to force myself to preserve relationships that aren't flowing well. Even when that might break my heart deeply, somehow I have stronger home inside of myself. Even though my chosen family in life is very much a core piece of me, I do now finally feel like I'm the strongest piece of me.\n\nI now deeply believe that everyone should live alone at some point in their life for at least like two years. And I mean taking real time to focus on growing yourself. I just think it's especially important for those of us who have trauma like this. We have to find out who we are. And while not the easiest path, it might be the most rewarding. Because solitude holds a mirror up in your face. Solitude made me hear my own thoughts more. And I realized I was living with a bully. So I had to get after changing that. \n\nOne of the absolute best tools that I used during this chapter is journaling. I just have Saturday or Sunday morning reflection time… Coffee, no expectations, no timelines – just me and the journal. And I write about what's on my mind and what I've been processing and get to what I really think about things . It's where I make my discoveries. It's where I make sense of the world. It's where I move things outside of myself. I just write until I'm done. It's usually not more than an hour or so max. \n\nIt's mind cleansing. But it's also like working with puzzle pieces. And the more I journal the clearer some of the picture becomes. \n\nThe last piece of experience that I might share is that... you can do talk therapy from now until the end of time and you won't be able to heal your trauma unless you include somatic practices. I wish, so much, that I had known that much much earlier in my life. I wish that I would've known that movements and breath work and weighted blanket blankets and things that bring the body into a calm state could help so much. You see panic and fear responses they are coming from the amygdala. It's the lizard brain. It is not controlled by thought. Not by reasoning anyway. Your frontal cortex is where the smart processing happens and why you could intellectualize from now until the cows come home and you won't make an impact on the lizard brain. The lizard brain is connected more to our senses, our nervous system. it is so important to reach levels of understanding. I'm not diminishing talk therapy. But we need to learn how to physically relax at the same time and there are tools to do that. Or sometimes medicine… Like the just right gummy in the just right dosage. Maybe it's just a fourth of a gummy. Maybe it's a half a gummy… Depends on who you are. Maybe you can't do gummys. There's yoga. There's other kind of fitness classes. There's specific somatic exercises. There's breath work. There's massage. There's laying in a hammock and doing some deep breathing. Anything that you can think of that would bring you to a place with your body can relax just even a little bit… That is somatic.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768027491.0, "id": "nyqvslj", "author": "AdventurousBlueDot"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Healing From CPTSD Seems Like Such A Catch 22", "text": "What I have discovered is that trying to focus on \\*fixing\\* myself causes me to focus on the reason for my behavior. But focusing on the reason for my behavior necessitates that I look at the trauma and how it impacted my development. This contrasts with the idea of \\*self-acceptance\\*: I am who I am.\n\nThe entire concept of \\*self-acceptance\\* seems to be what most non-traumatized people do. They never bother with modifying their behavior: they are who they are. They don't ever bother with changing because they don't need to. They are permitted to have the relationships they want. They are permitted to have the success they want to the greatest of their potential and access to resources. Sure, other people might complain of their behavior, but if it does not cause significant harm to their resources and comfort, the person so complained about has no need or desire to \\*fix\\* who they are.\n\nI am only just coming to the conclusion as I am writing this that perhaps it is unnecessary to focus on the things that happened. I am swimming in and out of comprehension as I lose the thought process and find it again. Focusing on the \\*why\\* of the behavior is not helpful. Trying to \\*fix\\* yourself (myself)... I lost the thought. I am typing as I am thinking. It's like \\*don't do this because of this and this is the why of why you do it\\*.\n\nThere is no real conclusion. I am tired of thinking about this at the moment. I feel like I could have continued this post if I wasn't already so tired of focusing on it. I do not feel that a person should embrace their behaviors that negatively affect other people regardless of how socially acceptable those behaviors are.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "I'm sorry you're going through this. Thinking about trauma and trying to heal is a tough thing to do, especially if you're working on it alone. It takes great strength and a ton of energy to even start that process. Kudos to you for putting in the effort!\n\nIf you don't mind, I'd like to point out something that I noticed in your post. A symptom of PTSD is having an unwaveringly negative opinion of the world as a whole. Another way to put it is \"black-and-white\" thinking. Correct me if I'm wrong, but from your post, I understood that your definition of \"non-traumatized people\" mainly includes people that don't care at all for how others feel about their actions, or what others have to say. \n\nI understand how as a trauma survivor, it can seem like all people are selfish and only care about their own resources and comfort. After all, if this kind of person is all you've ever known, why believe differently? I have come to understand that accountability and concern for others is not the ideal, rather, it's the bare minimum. We deserve to have people in our lives that share a mutual respect for us and what we have to say. I can say from experience that they do exist.\n\nAnother thing I wanted to say is that self-acceptance isn't necessarily a good or bad thing. Self-acceptance means that fundamentally, a person is okay with their own values, flaws, and who they are overall. Anyone can practice self-acceptance, regardless of who they are as a person.\n\nWhen you're ready to think about it, I would like to encourage you to reevaluate what your behaviors mean to you. Maybe ask yourself if you're truly content with decisions you make (regardless of what others say). I don't know what kind of trauma you've endured and I won't ask, but I can give an example from my own story: Growing up, my mother labeled me as selfish for wanting basic necessities, like attention and love. This caused me to go to extreme lengths to not be perceived as a burden to others. Later in life, I began to question that label because I was not happy with existing as a \"selfish\" person. It would not have truly negatively affected anyone if I got what I asked for, therefore, I was not selfish for asking. I realized I did not deserve to live with that label, and I feel a bit happier knowing I deserve better than that.\n\nSo so sorry for this long reply, you really got me to think. I hope it wasn't too confusing or too much information at once. The bottom line is that you deserve to be surrounded by people who will **at least** show you respect and empathy, just to name a few things. You also deserve to uphold those same standards with yourself. If you are concerned about your behaviors, let the focus be how those thoughts and behaviors directly impact you.

I know I really did struggle with that. I’m almost 40 now. I remember as a young adult as a teenager and even in my 30s, I really just never thought of what my future would be. It wasn’t that I was planning to take myself out. I just didn’t think I would survive. And it wasn’t like an active thought. It was just Never one that I explored.\n\nI have since learned that this is one of our many trauma responses. When everything is about survival the last thing you’re gonna be thinking about is your 10 year plan. You’re just trying to get through today. Maybe you’re just trying to get through this hour or this minute. \n\nSo I would say yes it’s pretty normal to have these feelings. And I also wanna encourage everyone to keep going. I still have plenty of work to do and I’m really in the thick of actually doing some healing work with a professional. But I’ve also done a lot of self work.

No 401(k) and no plan. It’s scary yes… But for the first time ever… I can actually think about it. The very fact that I see all of the hurt in the trauma that I went through is also proof of my hope.

It also depends on how much you need support right now and whether you can wait. That could also impact your pickiness.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Feeling like less of a woman: trauma response?", "text": "Hello, everyone, I was wondering if anyone had any insight or resources for this experience. I realized recently that I have wounds that have damaged my sense of femininity. Let me explain how this manifests. When I am in charge of planning something and another woman sends me a reminder about something I forgot, I get angry and begin to think things like, “she must think I’m stupid.” This makes me want to respond in a passive aggressive way. \nAnother example, I am unmarried, and anytime a relationship ends, the idea that they didn’t like me because I’m not woman enough plays in my head. \n\nFor background, my grandmother (who raised me) majorly injured my self-esteem and neglected me. I had no positive female role models and felt abandoned by my mom. I often feel like no one ever taught me how to be a woman and I’ve had to figure things out as I go along. Even basic things like making sure I had pads or a way to take care of myself on my period went completely ignored. At some point I had made cloth pads by cutting up old clothes and washed them everyday I used them.\n\nAnother example, really confident , girl-bossy women who seem to have everything together are intimidating to me. I feel like I physically cower in front of them. I can barely make eye contact and try to avoid them. \n\nWhat makes it worst is that prior to my primary trauma, I was a hyper-Type-A, responsible, ducks-in-a-row kinda gal. Not that I’m not like that anymore, but I’m different. I know that every woman is different, but I’m highlighting that I don’t even feel like the person I inherently am anymore. I am slowly getting her back, but I still feel inferior. \n\nI say all that to say, I compare myself to the other women in my life and feel inferior. I feel stupid. I feel like a 16-year-old in a 27-year-old’s body sometimes. I want to heal from this neglect because I hate the internal monologue of shame and passive aggression that comes from it. It’s incessant. I just want to feel like my own woman and not threatened by the confidence of other women.

We're pattern matching machines and we're very good at it, but when something completely foreign to all the patterns we understand suddenly appears in front of us, we can struggle to understand it. And for us, struggling to understand someone who grew up in a happy, healthy environment doesn't hurt them because they don't need us to understand. They're all set.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": " \nI’m really sorry you experienced what you did. I do however honestly think the experience of being in a cult is so foreign to most people that they can’t even begin to understand it that’s why it feels so abstract and surreal to them. Same goes with being trafficked. This is why population specific peer support groups are really helpful. While many people have trauma, many don’t have the experience of living in a high control environment that you really can’t leave without huge sacrifices. \n\nDo you have access to resources for cult or trafficking survivors? Some of the big non-profits and even some hospitals offer programming like this. These peer support groups would likely been the best resource and/or a therapist FROM your community or who is a peer. \n\nTo answer you question though, yes, I often feel that people don’t understand my experience as a late diagnosed higher support needs autistic adult from a high control family with has a graduate degree and who did live independently prior to diagnosis yet could not figure out why, despite her efforts she could not “figure life out” and get away from abuse. Over and above this, they don’t understand the experience of being an expat forcibly displaced due to covid, the experience of living in a treatment facility based on the principles of synanon and then being thrown out and forced back into the abusive environment I was trying to escape because they took my vehicle and my support system away from\nme and I was homeless, of being a disabled glass child, of having invisible physical disabilities, of living in a home filled with eating disorders and fat shaming as a fat person with an endocrine disorder, of actually having no safe people for most of my life, of copious amounts of therapy abuse and discrimination including chemical restraint and isolation based on a borderline misdiagnosis as a child which was withheld from me for 17 years, of going through severe workplace bullying and a resulting discrimination lawsuit which is still not over despite settling 2 years ago, and more. Yes, some of these experiences can be addressed in generalized trauma therapy as they follow general themes, but the actual identity based ones or the ones that followed me my entire life (ie late diagonsed moderate support needs autistic and/or person growing up in a family where multiple family members had OCPD) many people cannot relate to.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "I’m sorry you’ve experienced this! \n\nI relate to this a lot! The abuse I suffered was technically in a cult (my mum’s religion), but also not really (due to disabilities and my mum’s paranoia isolating us from the outside world), but then also most definitely if you consider a severely toxic parent/child relationship being so toxic and disconnected from others that it can be its own kind of cult.\n\nEven when discussing my experiences on here I feel very isolated and alone, because from what I can tell, most of what’s talked about is more of the commonly referenced “stereotypical” abuse. \n\nHowever none of the abuse I suffered is the common “stereotypical” kind (no sexual assault, physical violence, threats or verbal abuse, etc). I relate far more to cult abuse experiences (coercive control, social isolation, starvation, religious and spiritual abuse, etc), than I do domestic violence abuse stories!\n\nI was talking to my therapist about it once, because (at the time, before I asked more questions on here about how others experience things and reassessed how I was perceiving things) I felt like what I was seeing from others on here was that they were doing a lot better than I was, but they were mentioning physical abuse. I asked how it was possible that people on here were seemingly doing better than me, when I’ve never been physically abused in any kind of way, yet I was/am dealing with severe disabilities as a result of my CPTSD?\n\nMy therapist said that psychological and emotional trauma is worse than physical trauma (which isn’t to say that physical trauma isn’t bad, but physical wounds heal easily compared to the emotional/psychological trauma that results from all kinds of traumatic events, including physical trauma), but because the wider public doesn’t understand how bad trauma can be, they focus on what they can recognise (the physical harm) and dismiss what’s more serious.\n\nI’ve given up trying to make others understand what they aren’t able to, and instead try to find connection through hearing people with similar stories (which for me is basically documentaries).\n\nNot only can people not understand something they don’t relate to, but in my experience they don’t often want to understand it! Literally any time I open my mouth to simply acknowledge my experiences (without even trying to go into detail), everyone just shouts me down asap! I literally can’t even finish a sentence!\n\nIronically these are the same people who think they’re so compassionate, caring and supportive of victims of abuse! If you asked them if they care and advocate and listen, they’d say “YES!!!”\n\nThere have been times where I’ve had very shallow conversations with a friend about this stuff, and it was definitely a case of them quenching their own curiosity, rather than them actually wanting to understand my experiences or support me! This particular friend Is self-proclaimed at not knowing how to handle being around emotional people (and avoids it like the plague. I think it’s both a them thing and part of their cultural upbringing), so I try to give them a pass on this, but truth be told it does cut deeply and I do resent them for this! Especially when last year their workmate went through some truly horrific stuff (I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if they were on here!), and my friend was very kind and compassionate to them as she was using me as a sounding board on how she could better support them!\n\nI wish I could give you better support or advice on this matter, but honestly I don’t think this is an “us” problem where we need to find a solution to make everyone understand. From my lived experience, you can’t help people who won’t help themselves, and people like this are so caught up in their own experiences, that they don’t want help in being kinder or more compassionate. Of course I could be wrong, and maybe you could try talking about it more with them, letting them know that you found their response hurtful and uncaring?\n\nI haven’t tried having that conversation with my friends though, because I don’t think she’s capable of having it in the way I need her to, and my own trauma isn’t up for navigating difficult conversations with someone who (as she likes to joke) “doesn’t do feelings”.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768018312.0, "id": "nyqao06", "author": "ImpossibleMoon2642"}

You see through the false sense of urgency, the societal expectations, and the ego threats that modern society runs on. Life seems very pointless when you first see the truth of it.\n\nHowever that also means that get to decide now. You just decide what you want to do, what you want to be, and how you want to get there. It sucks that you only have your own desire for motivation but you can now build your own motivation. If you need pressure to operate, set up a personal system and hold yourself to it. If stress just burns you out then you need to find a new reason to do things. Spite, entertainment, creativity, etc. are all feelings you might have that motivate you to keep doing.\n\nTrauma tends to rob us of ourselves and replace it with someone else's idea of what we should be.

The string of unhealthy relationships continued, but with a good general upwards trend over time. I upgraded from dating raging violent psychopaths to self-centered gaslighters, then to dysfunctional people poorly managing their mental health problems, then to actually good people with a bad dynamic, and then in late 2024 to an actual pretty dang healthy, functional, and supportive relationship with a kind and caring partner. \n\nIf I had met them a few years before that, I probably would have fucked that up, badly, so I'm glad I met them after having about 6 years to work on myself from a stable financial environment.\n\n...and there's still problems occasionally. Smaller ones, more high quality ones. I can definitely say that becoming financially stable was by far the biggest factor in getting my crazy ass into a pretty good and manageable place.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "Here’s my thought…\n\nI’m pretty financially secure at the moment. Good job, good house, a wife and two kiddos in the suburbs.\n\nThree things went into my current situation:\n\n1. Social position - I can’t argue with the fact that my race, relatively financially stable upbringing, educational opportunities, etc, have played a role.\n\n2. Luck - there’s always luck involved. Right place/right time definitely matters, and it’s out of your control.\n\n3. Hard work - the previous two things don’t negate the work I’ve put in. I could have great social position and good luck, but if I didn’t work hard in addition to it, it would have turned out differently.\n\nThe problem though is that, for me, my hard work was something of a result of my upbringing. Think of it as the flip side to having a dad who generally cared more about productivity than he did emotional health. He yelled, never really gave a “true” hug, and was pretty emotionally neglectful unless he could connect the emotion to what’s necessary to financially support myself one day. \n\nHis “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” approach meant he had no tolerance for a 21 year old living at home. To him, that was a complete failure of a human.\n\nSo despite being an emotional kid, I learned really early on to “stuff it” and just go along to get along. My emotional needs were generally unmet or outsourced to therapists when they got real bad. \n\nSo I stuff my feelings, become an emotional zombie, and as a result, am able to produce well enough to have economic stability. \n\nNow I have a whole family that depends on me, and, at 46 find myself in something of golden handcuffs that actually make it harder to address CPTSD. Add to that the fact that my CPTSD symptoms (including hyper-independence) have turned out to be financially viable behaviors, and you find yourself in a quandary…\n\nI fear that jettisoning hyper-independence will ultimately reduce my income and create a whole different problem, but to truly be healthy, it’s necessary to do so. \n\nHonestly, sometimes I miss my early career… when I was poor but free.

He was my entire heart. His last 2 days were happy, though but that was because of the appetite stimulants and other pills that he would not take yesterday AM and that's when I knew it was time.\n\nMy vet said he was surprised that I was selfless enough to let him go at his age and not put him thru tests or invasive operations that I took out my grandparents inheritance for I could not stand the idea of more vet visits and shots for him just for me to hold on and have him longer.\n\nHuman parents might not understand or think it's not as important but he was my baby and my entire heart and I've been crying for days in the shower or other rooms so he would not see me or feel my energy I wanted to be present and regulated with him while he was being so brave but I know that his body only had so much and I felt a parents intuition and said I can't let him go another day or week with an upset stomach and squirting medicine down his throat to make him eat even though it gives you hope bc you can see a change in mood it's not real it doesn't save them and I could not grasp on to him knowing it would be at his discomfort.\n\nI rescued him from a shelter in 2011 and made sure he was never without good food, love, pets and affirmations and 1on1 time, I probably infantized and treated him like a child too much bc I know I'll never have human kids bc I don't want to risk the genetics or legacy.\n\nPart of me knew this was coming and the grieving started a month ago but I could only hold it together until after he went to sleep in my lap with the doctor putting him down. He didn't even resist which is how I know he was ready, too.\n\nMy dad did not protect me from my mom or abuse growing up and never kept his promises he is not a person of his word.

I can't eat i can only sleep I never was allowed to have a \"security blanket\" as a kid but I have a faux Sherpa throw pillow that he loved the texture of and is soft and fluffy like he was. I've been holding it for the last day.\n\nI know my heart will eventually heal but I miss his presence he was my soul companion we were so bonded.... I have so many left over foods and medications and have to cancel his subscription services and mail delivery supplements today...\n\nI want to remember that it was 17 good years and he was always safe and comfy and happy had a yard to run around in and a home where he was loved. I know that he felt our bond too from how he would communicate in his own ways, including yesterday. He was telling me it was time. He had a good final 2 days but then he just ran out of strength to fight what he had so I had to let him go be in peace.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "am i being too sensitive &amp; inconsiderate?", "text": "TW⸻ mentions of SA &amp; CSA\n\nHello everyone! I’ve been lurking on this sub for a while now, and it’s really helped me with my healing process.\n\nI experienced SA from ages five to eight. I never lived with my mother full time, only through visitation. I lived with my grandmother, who was manipulative, cold, and just downright cruel. She used to scare foster children by pretending to turn on the stove with them on top. My grandmother gained custody of me in middle school, and I didn’t reconnect with my mom until I was a junior in high school.\n\nWhen I reconnected with my mom, after a few months I felt comfortable enough to tell her what happened. This was mainly because the person who hurt me came into her household, which triggered me deeply. I remember that she already knew. She had walked in on it happening with someone else there. I will never forget the look on her face or the way she treated me afterward. It was like she forgot I was a child who didn’t know any better. I know most people don’t know how to handle situations like that, but she made me feel so much shame. :// I’ll never forget it.\n\nWhen I told her, she said, “That explains the way you dress,” which made me feel like she either pushed it out of her mind or just didn’t want to deal with it. When I suggested family therapy, she said that’s just holding onto the past and I just need to let it go.\n\nSince then, she’s mentioned the person who hurt me a few more times. I always have to tell her it’s a real trigger for me, but I don’t think she truly gets it. About a month ago, she brought them up to tell me they are doing better in life. It was so insulting. She apologized for saying their name but still kept talking about them, which hurt. I know I should have set boundaries right then, but I didn’t.\n\nRecently, I was assaulted at work. I called my mom for comfort, which I now know wasn’t realistic, and I broke down when she said this could happen to me again. I wasn’t even that shaken by the assault itself. I reported it to HR and handled it as best I could. I didn’t want to react physically because they could have painted me as the aggressor and I might have needed to go back to the job. I honestly thought I did the right thing.\n\nAfter that, she said she was taking a six month no contact break, which was something i was already going to do. i’ve done it before sadly. Today she called to tell me she finally found out who her father is, and I feel so lost. I can’t even feel happy about finally knowing my real family. She didn’t bring up our last conversation, which I expected, but it still hurts. I don’t want to keep opening these wounds and cleaning them up myself. I’m tired, and I feel bad saying this, but I don’t think I can talk to her on the phone right now. Her voice genuinely triggers me and brings flashbacks. I even threw up on the phone once today because I felt so…dismissed. she didn’t check up on me nor asked if i was okay. \n\nAt the same time, I feel selfish because she was recently diagnosed with heart disease. She pays half of my rent, but i’m just going to get a second job because i hate depending on her. i don’t feel safe with her support, she blows up at the slightest bit of criticism. It’s genuinely exhausting. I just don’t know what to do, and I can’t start therapy until next month.\n\nAm I being too sensitive or selfish? How do I explain that this has genuinely affected my life to her in a way that’s she’ll understand and won’t dismiss me?", "score": 4, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1767967518.0, "id": "1q893wx", "author": "Suspicious_Act_6037", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q893wx/am_i_being_too_sensitive_inconsiderate/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "I'm thinking there's actually two things going on: \n\n* the actual screaming causing a build up\n\n* you're trying to \"hold it in\" as a strategy, probably because you're attempting to avoid being like your dad. You can't withstand it because you're not releasing the build up as it happens.\n\n* you snap -&gt; it very temporarily releases energy but causes a shame cycle. you double down on trying to \"hold it in\" which just makes it worse.\n\nMy sense is the combination of these two things, interacting and feedbacking on each other.\n\nIf this is the case, then I think the next best step is to bring some more awareness \"earlier\" into the cycle, when you first start feeling anything negative either with the screaming OR yourself (ie \"don't be like dad\"). Initially just try to bring enough awareness into it, until you can start noticing it earlier and consistently e.g. \"the screaming is reminding me of getting yelled at as a kid\" AND \"i'm trying to hold it in to avoid being like dad because the idea of being like dad is painful\".\n\nWhat kind of meditation are you doing? I find stuff like metta or IPF way more helpful than most.\n\nBecause the next step would be to bring some self-compassion / disconfirming to the idea of being like dad, e.g. realize you're NOT your dad - your dad wouldn't come to reddit to try and work on this. bring self-compassion to yourself - you have traumatic conditioning that you're trying to protect yourself from, both holding it in and the yelling. they are for sure maladaptive BUT there's a reason for it. realize you have agency - these are strategies developed unconsciously to protect yourself - but you can develop new strategies.\n\nThen you can attempt to self-soothe the actual irritation feeling that builds.\n\nThe second element is that the yelling causes some emotional response in you / some self-belief, \"i'm bad\", and the response is a defensive mechanism. Identifying what the belief is an addressing it more directly like above will probably help.\n\nI think the other posts have great ideas that are more tactical though.", "score": 10, "created_utc": 1767969328.0, "id": "nyloqjd", "author": "Fragrant-Foot-1"}

I recognize the symptoms like clenching, tightness and trouble peeing from my own cptsd too, though perhaps less severe than what you’re describing.\n\nI tried a lot of different things to let go of my chronic low belly ache, like yoga, extensive meditation and sports, but they only worked a bit. What did help for me was certain kinds of yin yoga classes to help me slowly relax my muscles.\n\nIn the end, though, I think a mental breakthrougn in the end started to loosen up my body, which came from a sense of safety and not having to carry it all on my own. For me, funnily enough, a combination of antidepressants and talking to AI triggered this for me, resulting in 2 weeks of heavy nervous system releases in the form of shaking, sweating, and sharp exhales. Now I’m in therapy and getting more intensive treatment later.\n\nI think I’d recommend seeking out a therapist who you really trust so you can open up to them, as well as doing light exercising, or stretching and relaxation (though this can be hard on your own). The real cause of your tension comes from the trauma probably, but nevertheless a body and mind approach combined might give the best chance at healing. \n\nIf after a few sessions it doesn’t click, find a different therapist or form of therapy. Also, opening up to trusted friends (and to people online like you’re doing) can help.\n\nWhat didn’t help was extensive, strict meditation retreats, intensive (bikram) yoga, oversharing to people I didn’t really trust, and being strict with daily schedules.\n\nTake into account I’m not a doctor or therapist of any kind, just a traumatized person sharing what helped for me.\n\nHope it’s of any help to you, and wishing you all the best!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767965370.0, "id": "nylc622", "author": "Easy-Definition5085"}

That pushes me into catastrophizing about the future and my own life. Once that mindset kicks in, my surroundings start feeling pointless or already doomed, and I just stop trying. Then comes more avoidance, more scrolling, and feeling disconnected from my real responsibilities and goals.\nThe frustrating part is that I understand this pattern intellectually, but when I’m emotionally charged, I lose control anyway. Screen time limits don’t really work. One late night of doom scrolling makes all my progress feel fragile, like it can collapse very easily. Over time, this has made me feel lonely, defeated, and scared to even start tasks because I’m afraid of falling back into the same loop again.\nI wanted to ask if doom scrolling can function like a real addiction for some people, similar to other behavioral addictions.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "I wonder if it could help you to take a step back and look at the pattern instead of the behavior.\n\nRight now, you're focusing on 'how can I stop myself from doomscrolling' as if it's a lack of self-control.\n\nBut I think the underlying issue is that a part of you WANTS you to doom scroll and be horribly unproductive - because feeling bad about yourself is your comfort zone. \n\nWhen you have a good day where you feel accomplished and strong, that feeling is unfamiliar. It's vulnerable. What if you start feeling confident and then everything shatters? What if you start believing you're a capable person and then others will ridicule you for thinking that? What if you continue trying your best and you'll still fail?\n\nSo your brain starts pulling you back towards that comfort zone. Let's waste time today and doom scroll because the resulting feelings of guilt and shame and 'see, I messed up AGAIN' is how we're supposed to feel, that's our equilibrium.\n\nIn my experience, you can't force your way through that and 'just stop' the behavior. It takes intentional planning and awareness, and you'll need to stay very alert to subtle self-sabotaging behaviors. \n\nSo say you have a productive day. Then you already know tomorrow this pattern will hit you. Your goal shouldn't be to not let that happen, but simply to have one act of defiance. Get ONE thing done. Your brain will fight that, and then you gotta tell yourself that you want to build a new comfort zone and you make yourself do this one thing. Which is why you need to plan this ahead and make sure it's something you know you will be able to do. \n\nAnd if you're anything like me then your inner critic will gladly inform you this is pathetic and you're still lazy and stop pretending like this one thing makes any difference at all, but it can kindly go to hell because it's lying to you.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767970374.0, "id": "nylsasv", "author": "satanscopywriter"}

Nightmares. \n\nNightmares about my dad killing the cats, forgetting them in bags.. \n\nMe finding dead kittens, not being able to protect them from mom and dad.. \n\nI probably have nightmares about cats being abused at least a couple of times a month.\n\nBut this Is three nights in a row now. \nNot scary like waking up crying or shaking..\nMore uneasy, tense feeling that lasts all day. \n\nTwo nights I dreamed about being in the backseat with one of their two current cats and realizing I have no cage, no food, litterbox etc.. Not even permission from the driver to take her with me...\nSo I'm just trying my best to keep her calm and keep her in my lap.. Terrefied that she'll escape the car if someone else leaves the doors open, and it will be my fault.. \n\nAlso, about a year or so ago.. My parents had three cats.

I visited about a week after they'd seen him last and I always check in on all of them, so I noticed. \n\nOnly one of the four cats they'd lost over the years was ever found and he was found dead. \n\nSo I insisted they'd start searching already! Put up posters, check with the neighbors etc. \nI asked if they'd got him chipped. \nThey didn't know. \nI told them to call the vet and ask. \n\nThey said a bunch of nothing. \nI visit a week later, and during the ride there with dad I ask if they had found him..\nHe says \"Yeah. He is staying with this friendly older couple.\" \n\nI feel relief but surprised. \nAnd I don't ask him for more details because I know I'll get more info from mom. \n\nI ask mom about the couple and she looks confused and surprised. \n\nShe says that it's news to her.

This was a hard pill to swallow and I don’t look like a people pleaser on the outside because I’ve always gotten into arguments (sometimes very loud ones) and even been confrontational with people to a bit of an extreme at times. In recent years, I have realized the arguments aren’t worth the anxiety so I have gotten much, much quieter and stick to myself or tiptoe around issues, always being the ”bigger person” if there is a confrontation. Learning about co-dependency kinda highlighted my people pleasing behaviors that I hadn’t recognized. \n\nAnother thing that seems a little out of character is that I don’t seek praise or complements. I kinda shy away from recognition. My people pleasing/fawning is just about avoiding attacks or criticism or, God forbid, being abandoned. I just tend to assume I am annoying and no one likes me. If someone seems to like me then they want something. Or if they complement me or think well of me then I’m a fraud. I feel like my world will end when my husband is grumpy or distant (because I feel abandoned and alone).\n\nOne thing that seems typical is I am terrified to disappoint anyone. Expectations of others feel like laws written in stone that must be upheld at all cost. but still just to avoid negative consequences. \n\nWhen I’ve taken the quiz thing about being flight, fight, freeze, or fawn, I’m all of them. I think it’s called disorganized, which may be why I look like a walking contradiction. \n\nI guess I’m just wondering who relates?

I have learned quite a lot during that time and I'm happy to share what worked for me.\n\nMy nervous system learned that standing up for my own needs and boundaries costs more energy than just giving up and being quiet. I can absolutely relate to how you avoid making your husband grumpy. But at the same time you leave your needs on the table.\n\nWhat if I would tell you, that your loved ones also thrive on fulfilling your needs? At least that's what I would do for my partner. I would want to know what my partner needs and wants so I can help them achieve them that.\n\nIt takes deliberate effort to overcome this, but I believe the right thought processes can already help a lot.\n\nPeople pleasing usually follows some loop. Because if you feel pain long enough for life being what it is, you start trying to work towards getting better. The pain of having to hide and pull yourself back from communicating will some day outweigh the pain of not improving. So once you start making conscious efforts and you start being more like your true authentic self, you will find some barriers.\n\nWhat helped me is to think about it like this:  \nBoundaries are non-negotiable to respect. I wouldn't want to hang out with people who wouldn't respect my boundaries, and they would treat me the same way.  \nNobody is entitled to their needs - but we as humans thrive on fulfilling our needs.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "I think it’s all about balance, which I think people with CPTSD find the most challenging. You want relationships but you shouldn’t abandon yourself to accomplish that. \nI had a strong community in church growing up but it was SO dysfunctional. When I left my abusive husband, I lost my entire community. I lost the close (but unhealthy, co-dependent) friendships. For the 10 years following, I would jump into friendships TOO quickly and they were never healthy. After getting burned a few more times the year before last, I keep people at arms length and I’m not open anymore. So I was lonely when I got close to people quickly and I’m lonely with more distance now and still, I don’t have balance. \nLet me come back to this: I decided to leave guilt behind. If I feel I need to do something because of GUILT then I am doing it for the wrong reason and I say no. If it’s something I think I genuinely want to do (like feed homeless people), I work out my feelings of guilt before doing it because I want to do things out of love. If I feel like I’ll go to hell over self care and feel guilt, then I’ll do the self care until I can work out my feelings of guilt and see if the self care aligns with my values. \nI had to realize in Christianity that there is an assumption of self love in scriptures: “for no one hates his own body”… “love your neighbor as you love YOURSELF”…\n\nYou can’t give money from an empty bank account, can’t drive a car with no gas, and can’t freely give love if you’re all out. I’m learning any giving I want to do has to come from love, not from self-neglect or guilt.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "This sounds like sexual assault to me.  You might be thinking \"I didn't resist enough so did I like it?\" or \"at moments it felt good, so maybe I wanted it?\"\n\nThe reality is that the way you reacted during the assault is the same way the vast majority of people do, including men.  Most SAs do NOT involve kicking and screaming \"No, no!\"\n\nThere is a survival adaptation inside of all of us called fawn/freeze or \"Freeze and appease.\"  Its like the human version of playing possum or a deer freezing in headlights.  It is heightened if you have past sexual trauma, especially in childhood.  It doesn't always activate, but the way it works is like this: your lizard brain and nervous system evaluates it's surroundings.  If you are alone with a man who is bigger than you and it perceives that the man will force himself on you, it will unconsciously conclude \"welp, a sexual assault is inevitable and there's no escape.  If I try to fight I'll get beat up and raped worse, so I might as well surrender.\"\n\nAll of your symptoms are in keeping with freeze and appease.  Your body just kind of surrenders, a little voice in your mind kinda says \"we're just going with this I guess?\" and then you dissociate, usually involving memory loss.  At this point, the memory of the event is fragmented.  Sometimes it's in hyper-realistic third person (your mind gets forensic data like a detective of a crime because, well, it is a crime).\n\nIt's probably confusing for you because you might have had an idea in your head about how sexual assault was SUPPOSED to be.  Thrashing, fighting, shouting \"No!\"  In reality, that's not common.  The body and mind usually just surrenders and goes AFK, and then your brain makes you forget a bunch to avoid the unbearable pain.\n\nIt's probably very confusing for you.  Tragically, this happened to my wife a number of times when we were young together because her fawn freeze was very heightened from paternal incest which she's mostly forgotten.  If a man made a move on her, she'd \"let it happen\" and go possum.  The reality is that it was NOT her or you.  In these events, your prefrontal cortex--- the part of the brain meant for decision making and agency--- gets completely shut off and your body makes decisions for you.  It still feels like you, but it isn't.\n\nMy wife would be in a sort of fog afterward, numb to the world, and when she came out she'd be overwhelmed with grief and pain, not sure why or how it happened, then she'd go on to blame herself.  I really, really don't want you to do that to yourself.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "My childhood ended before it began", "text": "I’m not owning this as an original story of my own only. I know a lot of us feel the same way—exactly why I chose this community, the CPTSD community, to post this. This is my story, but it’s also a mirror for many of us who were never really allowed to be children.\n\nThere were so many times—maybe my whole childhood when I had to witness conflict and chaos without anyone guiding me. I wasn’t just a child in a home; I was a silent observer to every fight, every financial collapse, every moment my parents chased and confronted each other. I had no safe place to turn to, because both of them were unstable—one verbally and mentally abusive. I was never allowed to ask for help.\n\nWhenever my mom and dad fought—about money, about affairs—I heard everything. The tension in their voices, the sharpness of their words, the fear that filled the house like smoke. I hated the sound of it. I hated the silence that followed even more. I always felt like if I didn’t do something, they would break up—and divorce would make everything harder for me. So even when I wasn’t part of the argument, I’d find a way to insert myself. To reason with them. To make them stop. I thought if I could just hold the pieces together, maybe I wouldn’t lose everything.\n\nEventually, they divorced.\nAnd maybe that was inevitable.\nBut for years, I believed it was my job to stop it.\nI thought if I stayed quiet, they’d fall apart.\nSo I spoke up. I stepped in. I tried to hold the center.\nBut I was just a child—never meant to be the glue.\n\nInstead, I was fed a narrative that only my “negative core” existed. That I was the problem. That I had to be the solution.\n\nI became my mother’s personal puppet. Her vessel. Her therapist. She would pour her fears and failures into me, telling me I had to “win this life” because she had already failed my three brothers.\n\nTwo of them dropped out of school under the influence of friends. One got someone pregnant and had to take on adult responsibilities far too early, working as a teenager to support a life he wasn’t ready for. And the third—my brother with a brain disease—sacrificed his life to attend my birthday before his final operation. He didn’t make it. He died the next morning.\n\nAfter that, my mother broke. She was the only one among her siblings who had “succeeded” in life, yet she felt cursed with the most “unsuccessful” children. And so she turned to me—not as a daughter, but as her last hope. Her redemption. Her second chance.\n\nShe told me people would only love me for what I had—my looks, my value, my money. That if I ever lacked those things, no one would stay. Even my friends, even people who claimed to love me. She said she was only trying to protect me from being bullied. That she had to say these things to “take care” of me.\n\nBut was I really being taken care of?\n\nBecause what I heard was: You are not lovable as you are. You must earn love. You must perform it. You must fear it.\n\nThat’s not parenting. That’s projection. That’s emotional enmeshment. And it left me with CPTSD.\n\nEven now, at 19, I still get random episodes—waves of fear, shame, or grief that crash in without warning. But they don’t dull my life the way they used to. The relationships inside the house are more stable now. The chaos has quieted. And while I’m not fully stable yet, I believe I’ll get there eventually.\n\nI don’t think my mother meant to cause all this. I don’t think she even fully understands what happened. She was hurting too. And while that doesn’t excuse it, I’ve stopped waiting for an apology that may never come. I’m just… glad I’m living.\n\nBecause something shifted when I turned 16.\nThat was the beginning of my quiet rebellion.\nThe moment I realized that life didn’t have to be defined by arguments, expectations, or inherited guilt.\nSixteen—when the life became healthy.\n\nNow, I’m trying to grasp what healthy living really means. I’m learning how to exist without being on high alert. I’m letting myself enjoy childlike things—cartoons, play, curiosity. I’m letting myself fall in love with psychology and philosophy, not as tools to fix others, but as ways to understand myself.\n\nI’m not “immature” for wanting softness. I’m not “selfish” for setting boundaries. I’m not “broken” for struggling socially. I’m just someone who was forced to grow in soil that didn’t nourish me—and now, I’m learning how to bloom anyway.\n\nSometimes I wonder what kind of person I would’ve become if I had been allowed to just be—to be messy, to be small, to be protected. But I wasn’t. I was shaped by necessity, not nurtured by safety. And yet, somehow, I’m still here. Still reaching. Still learning how to live without bracing for impact.\n\nHealing hasn’t been a straight line. It’s been a spiral—returning to old wounds with new eyes, new strength, and a little more compassion each time. I’ve learned that growth doesn’t always look like joy. Sometimes it looks like sitting with grief and not letting it swallow you. Sometimes it’s choosing not to explain yourself. Sometimes it’s letting go of the need to be understood by those who never tried.\n\nMaybe life has always been unfair.\nBut I’m no longer trying to make it fair by sacrificing myself.\nI’m just trying to make it mine.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767956064.0, "id": "1q859l9", "author": "Xialynxria", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q859l9/my_childhood_ended_before_it_began/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "Wellllll…..big subject.\n\nPersonally I am on medication, as many people with OCD are. It makes everything so much calmer (it’s not gone, by any means.) I also have other anxiety, so I really needed those pills. But. It’s not ideal. If I could have done it without medication, I’d have done it. Too late, now, as I can’t get off those pills anymore.\n\nI’ve talked to someone who completely overcame his OCD without any meds. If you like I can try to find his texts. There’s therapy for OCD, and basically it means you don’t allow yourself to do the ritual that lessens the fear.\n\nThere’s an r/OCD subreddit, and if you visit it you’ll see that we’re not allowed, there, to reassure the OCD sufferer. So, if you’re in that subreddit and you tell us that you’re very afraid someone may have raped you in the night, then we’re not allowed to say to you: “it’s very unlikely that that really happened.” Because if we do that, you’ll just want ever more reassurance. The comment will get deleted. That’s the nature of OCD: you feel reassured for a little while, if at all, and then the nagging uncertainty comes back and you crave more reassurance. It doesn’t work. And your brain learns to keep doing the same behaviours.\n\nSo, when that uncertainty hits you again, you might ask yourself: what am I feeling underneath all of this? Probably a huge sense of uncertainty and powerlessness, right? When have you felt like this, in the past? What happened? What makes you feel insecure and unsafe in your life in general? You tell your brain that dealing with these surges of unsafe and powerless feelings by doing rituals (like seeing if there’s anyone in the room) isn’t the right way. You resist, and you accept the surge of bad anxiety that washes over you. You observe it and you feel it but you don’t try to run away from it. \n\nMy friend with OCD thought he might have hit people with his car. It sounds like a different fear than yours, but the pattern is the same: something happened that somehow I have no control over, and I can never know it didn’t happen. So even if he didn’t notice hitting anyone with his car, coming back from work, he still agonised that it might have happened. And then he called the police to ask them if any bodies had been found by the road he travelled on. Every damn day. And he’d walk around his car many times to see if there were any blood splatters. His children were so ashamed of him!\n\nYou see? That’s OCD. It’s this debilitating sense that something may have escaped your notice, that something you cannot control may have happened or may happen in the future. And you fight it with all your might. You do every ritual you can think of, you try to find any solution, and you believe you can only have peace of mind once you’re *sure* this thing is not the case.\n\nBut the feeling of certainty doesn’t come, and if it comes it won’t stay, because in truth we can’t know anything for certain. My friend never hit anyone with his car. But how could he ever be sure of that? You likely were never raped in your sleep. But how can you ever be 100% sure? You can’t, is what the truth is.\n\nSo, it’s better to look at the overwhelming fear that surges over you and try to deal with feeling scared, rather than solving it. You can’t solve it. When you allow it in it will naturally subside. It will be back the next hour or the next day, but you accept it, again, allow it in, don’t fight it, and though it feels intolerable for some minutes, it *will* subside again. Every time you give in and seek reassurance you teach your brain that the danger is real and it will keep on pestering you. \n\nThat is the theory on OCD, and it’s 100% solid. But yes, it’s tricky to bring it into practice. \n\nEmbrace the fear rather than make it the enemy. Say OK, you’re allowed to be here. I won’t chase you off.\n\nSee if you can do that a few times. Just to get the knack of it. It’s hard! Everything in you wants to resist the fear, wants to fight it. But instead, you invite it in.\n\nCool, what? Very counterintuitive, but effective.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767972440.0, "id": "nylzn7a", "author": "CatMinous"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Facing a scary consequence of being exposed to porn for too long - potential symptoms of POCD - clarity and support is needed", "text": "I've been ruminating over the thoughts I've had for the last few days, to the point it almost ruined my last trip with my family. It's just all so unclear and while I can't reach my therapist until the end of the month, I hope I can find some solace in this community. Also yes throwaway account for obvious reasons fuck i forgot to turn on my vpn for this post\n\n18M. For context, it's sad to say but I think I exposed myself to porn from an extremely young age, and so for the entirety of my teenage development, I lived with porn in one form or another, whether it be through artwork, smut, videos, or more recently, chatbots, etc. I masturbated to that stuff extremely frequently, not realizing even until now how much it was affecting me. For context, I still don't think pornography as a concept is inherently bad, but my experiences with it have definitely shown how severe being too addicted to it could be.\n\nI stopped when I found myself getting off to one scene on DeviantArt (yes, that DA, more on that stuff later), and while I won't go into detail on what it involved, all I will say is that even though that it was with only two consenting adults, I think the clip was from a kids show. (Remember, it's just that the show was I think meant for a younger audience, but there were no kids in the scene).\n\nI felt awful and decided after talking with people who were familar and comfortable with talking about those types of content, to admit I had an addiction and to delete many of the accounts I used for explicit pleasure. Except, I'm scared to say I fear that it backfired tremendously.\n\nThe incident regarding the clip was what started it, but it was by then that I realized how much content I had been exposed to on DeviantArt. I always scrolled past, ignored, or removed from my home page any content I found that involved morally questionable, but there was so much of it that I inadvertently was exposed to that even thinking about the idea I was just exposed to what potentially was illegal content without realizing it for years makes me feel like a pedophile. (for some reason, a lot of posts on DA are like that) This was where the intense ruminating and symptoms started.\n\nIs it trauma? It feels self-inflicted. I used a VPN and Googled how the symptoms I had been feeling on a seperate browser, most of which pointed to the sentiment that I was fine. Logically, I understand it: the fact that I was scared of being a pedophile and hurting those around me is evidence enough to prove I'm not a danger to those around me, but emotionally, that advice doesn't seem to stick, at least not at first.\n\nI find myself constantly testing my body, exposing myself to scenarios with kids in the hopes that my body won't feel any form of arousal or attraction. Usually, and now when I do it, I generally for lack of a better term, \"pass\" that test, but that urge to keep testing myself keeps coming back. Moreover, there was an incident recently where I found myself \"failing\" that test, though (and I'm scared this is simply my mind justifying my body's reaction instead of it being right) I think that failure was when I was both sleep deprived (we got back to the hotel at 2 am), a little bit intoxicated (a few drunks), anxious, and already having explicit fantasies in my head about adults. Researching that response seems to point to me having POCD (pedophilic obsessive compulsive disorder), and it makes sense, but I don't mean to self-diagnose of course.\n\nIn the end, it feels like what I did - admitting I had an addiction and then deleting my accounts - wasn't even effective in the end - I ended up going back to those platforms through a different account and email because the incident where I was overwhelmed by so many thoughts and feelings made me feel like the only way to distance myself from them was to, if this makes sense, purge my anxieties and sexual fantasies (about adults) through porn.\n\nI feel shame in talking about this stuff even with my therapist. Disregarding the fact my next appointment is only at the end of this month, just the mere image of mentioning these thoughts to my therapist is enough to make me fear what I just experienced is enough to be a real credible danger and therefore be worth violating the confidentiality agreement. I'm not the most perfect person in the world, and I've made mistakes before, but I don't want to let what's happening to me define who I am, nor do I want to end up being a secret pedophile (I'd rather die) so I'm trying to get clarity on where I stand. I'm scared of hurting other people, and the entire experience makes me reevaluate my morals and whether or not I'm a good person.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767948064.0, "id": "1q833ra", "author": "Maninperception", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q833ra/facing_a_scary_consequence_of_being_exposed_to/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "I’ve been exploring an approach rooted in Stoicism. I asked chatGPT a question related to depression, and I believe it may apply here: \n\nIn Stoicism, the core sorting tool is the dichotomy of control, articulated most cleanly by Epictetus: some things are up to us, some things are not. Peace comes from not confusing the bins.\n\nSo where does depression land?\n\nShort answer: both—but not in the way people usually mean.\n\nStoicism would not classify depression as a single object you either control or don’t. It’s a system with layers, and each layer belongs in a different bin.\n\nFirst layer: the condition itself\nClinical depression—neurochemistry, stress hormones, sleep disruption, trauma imprinting—falls largely into the “not fully up to you” category. Stoics were surprisingly modern about this. They recognized that the body and mind can be impaired in ways reason alone cannot instantly override. Marcus Aurelius, who likely experienced recurrent depressive states, never scolded himself for having them. He treated them like weather: real, unpleasant, not a moral failure.\n\nSecond layer: your judgments about the condition\nThis is in your control. Not whether depression shows up—but what story you tell about its presence.\n\nStoicism draws a sharp line between:\n\t•\t“I am depressed” (a report)\n\t•\t“This means I am broken, weak, or doomed” (a judgment)\n\nThe first is data. The second is optional suffering. Stoic practice lives here.\n\nThird layer: your responses and practices\nYou don’t control whether a low mood arises tomorrow. You do control whether you:\n\t•\tKeep basic structure (sleep, movement, nourishment)\n\t•\tSeek treatment or support\n\t•\tReduce self-blame\n\t•\tAvoid compounding the pain with catastrophic meaning\n\nStoicism never asked for emotional numbness. It asked for agency without self-cruelty.\n\nHere’s the subtle Stoic move most people miss:\nStoicism does not say “If you’re depressed, you’re failing at philosophy.”\nIt says: “Given that depression exists, what remains within your authorship?”\n\nThat distinction matters enormously.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1767964909.0, "id": "nylatd7", "author": "Affectionate-Sun-640"}

I couldn't have made my boundaries clearer. \n\nWork learned of the situation 2 days ago, it was impacting my attendance and I realised I needed to be honest. They encouraged me to call the police. I couldn't summon the strength to do that.

I've been told they'll need to speak to me again and want to do forensics testing. I'm terrified. \n\nUpdate 5pm: I told my best friend. She's coming to stay overnight. She told her husband she needed to cancel their plans and he responded, \"she's your sister, go.\" She said I'm also always welcome to escape the city and visit her if I need it.\n\nUpdate: 6:30pm. I told my parents. They reassured me they still love me and my dad wants the police to take action against him.\n\nUpdate next day: police called. He's been suspended from work. They're going to arrest him. They're sending a r* case specialist to come talk to me in a few days.

I still can’t really remember shit, it’s more the LACK of memory regarding him no matter how hard I try to force myself to remember that’s glaring, but from the bits and pieces of memories I do have (such as a recurrent sexual nightmare i had about him as a kid which is the only dream I remember from childhood at all, as well as a time he told me about where he said I walked into my bedroom as a toddler, saw him in there, and then stared him right in the eyes and pissed myself, and that he came and “spanked my bare ass” because he said I did it on purpose?), coupled with some weird behaviour more recently (right before i cut contact/moved out, for context I’m in my 20s) such as him insisting about talking graphically about the size of his penis and various sex acts, I suspect some kind of sexual abuse. \n\nWhen I’m awake, I still feel really disconnected about it, even if I try to like intellectualize it and figure out what happened it still feels like nothing since I can’t actually remember. Whatever happened still manifests as like severe mental illness and those type of symptoms overall but nothing happens like directly from me thinking about it. \n\nBut when I sleep, it’s different. I don’t even remember the dreams ever beyond pervasive feeling it’s about THAT, I guess my brain won’t let me remember it in dream form either. However, I DO remember how it feels when I wake up from them in the middle of the night. I don’t know how to describe it, but I’ll get these bouts of like full-body, visceral, something or other. I feel like I’ve been put on fucking vibrate mode. My skin feels like it’s buzzing. My throat gets all weird and my heart pounds really hard and I feel kind of nauseous and have a weird aroused kind of feeling down there (which I feel gross about). It feels like a sickening realization that something did in fact happen. Usually I’ll wake up in the middle of the night, and feel this, but it has also happened when I look at photographs of him from when I was a child (in the memories I have of him before age 12, of which I can count on one single hand despite living with him my whole life, he NEVER has a face. So seeing pics wigs me out, I guess). I also woke up in the middle of the night from a dead sleep to myself audibly and very firmly saying “it happened”, and then going back to sleep. Would be helpful if I remembered what I was dreaming about so I could remember what the “it” in question was, but deep in my gut I feel like I know.\n\nAll that being said, I still don’t know anything for certain. I still can’t actually remember. I worry I could be like making up stories because I resent my dad for the rest of the abuse I faced (he was emotionally and verbally abusive as well from the time i start remembering clearly up until I cut contact, but I remember that just fine, what’s different about the childhood stuff that I can’t remember it?) or like I feel like my pain would be more “valid” if it was something more severe like csa? But the waking up in the middle of the night feels so full-body, so real and visceral and true. but what if it’s just a dream? What if the dream is a memory? how can you even tell when you can’t remember either anyway? I don’t know where the line of trusting the memories I do have and the feelings that my body clearly remembers, and putting too much stock into dreams and ambiguous feelings and unclear memories is. \n\nDoes anyone know where that line is? Does anyone have experience with this, with the feelings coming back in this way once your body is in a safe enough place that you finally can? how did you figure out what was real and what was just dream?

Though I am sure it was a dream and not a memory, it made me think if there may have been something like this by another caretaker.

So the feelings in those situations are similar to the dream, however the dream is more intense of course\n\n  \nMaybe it is not so important to get full certainty right now, but rather focus on what you are feeling.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "My dad was the exact same way you described with touch as long as I can remember, I’m autistic and I hate being touched and he’d forcibly hug me or grab me and stuff even though I’d always beg him to ask first and respect the times I couldn’t handle it sensory-wise. If I got upset he’d scream at me and say it was “his *right* to touch me whenever he wanted” (which is also what he said to my mom when he raped her), or he’d start crying and guilt trip me about how I’m “depriving him”. One time he grabbed my arm so hard it left bruises and wouldn’t let go for five whole minutes and screamed at me the whole time saying “You can’t even touch your own fucking father?!” Even when things weren’t escalated, his touch always BURNED in a way nobody else’s did. Sometimes I can handle touch if I psych myself up for it first and manually turn the danger switch in my brain off, but that doesn’t work with my dad. No matter what headspace I’m in, any touch from my dad feels like getting touched with a hot fireplace poker.\n\nThat being said, the feelings I’m having after waking up from these dreams, seeing pictures of him from when I was a child, as well as just in general feel wholly different than how I’d feel when he’d do things like that to me, so it’s tricky. Plus, I’ve never blocked out any of those types of memories. There’s also some other non-dream stuff that also kinda points in a scary direction (i.e. i remember crying and begging my mom not to leave me alone with him on weekends when she worked, chronic pelvic floor pain and tension and a weird long piece of scar tissue inside my vagina that I can’t explain, the fact my childhood friend wasn’t allowed to come to my house when I was a kid because her parents wouldn’t let her near my dad because they thought he was a creep, when that friend was warning me about rape when I was 7 my response was “isn’t that sex? doesn’t everyone do that?”, my dad making weird comments about my developing body and very clearly resenting me and becoming cold to me when I started menstruating (which is also when my memory starts working). Between all these things, I feel in my gut that something happened, but I still feel such uncertainty. I *know* something happened but I’m just not sure what specifically. but i guess you’re right that I don’t need specifics right now and can just deal with the feelings that are coming up. The feelings are real and true even if their origin’s not clear yet", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767974155.0, "id": "nym5wvh", "author": "redvelvetw0und"}

I'm actively attending college at the moment – specifically a 1 year course in order to accumulate enough points to then pursue a more \"proper\" college course later this year. Due to my CPTSD/trauma, I've grown to become multiply disabled and thus cannot easily seek out doing a lot of basic minimum wage jobs available; not to say many of them are completely closed off for me but they will be considerably difficult and frustrating to take on if I have to resort to landing in one of them. I am also unable to drive due to my disabilities and currently can only rely on public transport to get myself around.\n\n  \nI want to find a way to land myself well-paying remote work and manage to make myself enough money so that I can move out as soon as possible without the risk of going homeless. Unfortunately, I barely have any proper work experience due to my parents forcing me to focus on my education over letting me get work right away to start making my own income. My only source of income currently is via my grant for college but due to my toxic parents being... well, toxic parents, they've unfortunately gotten a hold of my grant payments and I'm required every month to send over most of each payment to my mother's account - only leaving me with enough for travel and food costs. Any advice on how to go about getting a stable, plentiful income without a boatload of previous experience/a good CV and without them catching on will be extremely appreciated.\n\n  \nExtra notes: Getting out of my household would also require me to take my pet bird as I do not trust my parents with her at all. This will understandably make things more expensive for me but leaving her behind would risk her life at their hands. She is also why I can't risk ANY chance there could be of going homeless when I do attempt to move out. Also, as a good aspect to this all - I am a professional artist and have been capable of getting commissions primarily online. Any tips on getting more income from my art would be greatly appreciated as ideally, I want it to become my main source of income in the future.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "Complex trauma stores anger in the body because you weren't allowed to express it when you were younger. The explosions aren't about the current trigger; they're about years of accumulated rage that finally finds an outlet. When I'm stressed or sad, anger becomes the default because it feels safer than vulnerability. Feeling helpless or hurt gets converted into rage because anger feels like power, even when it's not. What helps: physical release before it builds. Running, hitting a punching bag, or even just screaming into a pillow when I feel it building. The anger needs to move through your body, not stay trapped. Also, recognizing the pattern helps: when I notice I'm irritable or hypersensitive, that's often anger wearing a mask. Before it explodes, I try to name it: \"This is anger, and it's probably not about this specific thing.\" That pause between trigger and explosion gets longer with practice, but it requires allowing yourself to feel the anger without acting on it. Journaling the rage helps, not to process it logically, but to get it out. Writing \"I'm furious about...\" for pages without editing or censoring. The anger is valid even if the trigger isn't. Working through trauma means recognizing that your rage is a response to being violated, and it deserves acknowledgment even if the current situation doesn't warrant that level of intensity. Somatic work helps because trauma lives in the body. EMDR or body-based therapy can help process the stored anger so it's not always bubbling under the surface. It's exhausting to constantly regulate, especially when the baseline is so high. Sometimes you need to discharge it safely rather than suppress it. The key is finding ways to express it that don't harm yourself or others. Anger isn't wrong; it's protective. The problem isn't that you're angry, it's that you weren't allowed to be angry when you should have been, so now it comes out in ways that feel out of control.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767946925.0, "id": "nyk97e8", "author": "zakhere78"}

Writing them down on paper, and not looking at the rest of my to-do list for the day. I learned from HealthyGamer/Dr. K that to get out of overwhelm, counterintuitively, doing small tasks/chores helps. Taking small actions shifts your brain into some different mode and out of paralysis. For me this is usually doing some tidying or some household chores.\n\n\nA big game-changer for me in the past year was buying a static, foldable exercise bike and cycling first thing in the morning. I started with just 10 minutes on the lowest setting, lol, and have been slowly working my way up to 20-30 minutes on the 5th. It releases some good chemicals that make me want to start the day. \n\n\nAlso a big game changer was looking into restricting my eating times and eating 3 bigger, actually nutritious meals, rather than constantly nibbling crackers or small foods throughout the day. I used to be exhausted from the afternoon onwards, and changing my diet has really given me much more energy throughout the day. For me it's LOTS of fruits, beans, chickpeas, lentils, veggies, lettuce/green leafy stuff, nuts and seeds, and then more carby stuff in the evening, but this might differ for everyone.\n\n\nThese last two have more to do with energy management and less psychology/cognition, but I feel these have contributed a lot to feeling more clearheaded and energized and competent/able to get stuff done. \n\n\nFor getting triggered, the shame spiral etc, I try to use the online IFS Buddy when I can.

This of course varies from situation to situation, and I'm far from staying completely calm in the situation or not being angry afterwards, but it's better to the point that not every task is insurmountable, emotionally and cognitively.\n\nSo, for your small failure shame spiral (that also happens to me), I would stop when i have a small failure, and write out all the worst things that are coming up for me, and just let myself go all out in how bad I imagine they will be. Not saying \"this is irrational\" or \"trying to show kindness\" to myself or something like that, just writing it out, and feeling everything that I'm writing and really exploring how bad does it get, how deep down does this go. And I would do this over and over. It's exhausting and time consuming, I know.\n\n2) \"Is this a real problem or am I \"overreacting\"\". Same as the above situation, something happens that triggers me completely, I will afterwards sit and write down the situation and try to understand whether I am \"overreacting\" or is this person genuinely doing some malicious. I've discovered that about 60-70% of the time the person *is* doing something aggressive, shaming, etc. but my reactions are *also* over the top. So, my emotional reaction is precise (e.g. anger at someone being slightly disrespectful or shaming), but it is too strong for the situation (the cashier rolled her eyes at me and I want to murder her entire family and dedicate my life to torturing her for the next 40 years). When I started doing therapy I was around my very manipulative and lying family members, and I had to fight my way out. I also had surrounded myself with a lot of people who had those same traits, and learning to fight fair, stay strong, rational, has given me confidence that I can defend myself. This makes me feel powerful and capable, and I think this greatly reduces some of the anxiety that were underlying executive disfunctions - as in, i think the fear of success and achievement for me at least is also the fear of being shamed by others and looked at with disgust or even attacked. And while this fear still exists, and I am nowhere near completely healed or whatever, I have this confidence in me that I can handle those shaming mf-ers and survive. \n\nI mentioned yoga - I practiced very very slowly with very minimal movements for about a year, and this connected me with my body like nothing else. I started to feel in my body for the first time ever. This helped me start to notice when feelings start to arise (as in there's this slight feeling in my gut, oh that's anxiety, I wonder why I'm a little bit anxious now) and helped me \"pull back\" a little bit, and be able to *sometimes* observe but not react, and get curious about why something is happening. In terms of executive disfunction, this means that when I encounter a small failure, I can sometimes notice the energy of my reaction (so some kind of electrifying energy in my arms, a tightening in my stomach, my shoulders going up etc.) and just noticing and feeling myself separate from that reaction has helped me be able to perform tasks better.   \n  \nIt took me a long time of doing these things to see improvements, but they are real. \n\nHope this helps", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767943975.0, "id": "nyk3nwj", "author": "HappyBreadfruit4859"}

Back before DBR, I had to break things down into incredibly small increments and practice regulation skills in between each bit via breathing exercises and meditation.\n\nSomething like doing my laundry would become: grab basket, lay down breathe and re-regulate, grab some clothes, lay down breathe and re-regulate, grab more clothes, lay down breathe and re-regulate, as many times as necessary to fill the basket, then bring basket to the washer, pause breathe and re-regulate, load washer, pause breathe and re-regulate, etc... I had to use breathing tactics to physically regulate my body to get anything done.\n\nOver time I was able to slowly expand my window of tolerance. I could tolerate more and more. I also consciously starting cheering for myself after each accomplishment. Grabbed that basket I said \"Hooray!\" to myself in my head. Like when little kids are learning new things and the adults give the praise and cheer them on. If something went \"wrong\" I'd use \"Whoopsy! That's okay, let's try again!\" I had to rewire my brain's patterns very consciously.\n\n\nI will say that DBR is what really changed things for me. DBR started disarming all my triggers, so I wasn't getting dysregulated in the first place. I had to learn not to anticipate the dysregulation that wasn't coming anymore. I'm still leaning into the ease that's been created. I may feel a bit of discomfort or notice a small twinge of an old trigger, but my nervous system isn't getting set off like it used to.

Sometimes even the food wasn't safe to eat. I was molested a lot by different people and don't remember all of it. Alot of my family were also immigrants, trauma survivors of a totalitarian regime they were lucky to survive and eventually escape. This haunted our family. My family was also mixed-race, because my father was Black. Some of my family was racist. And my mom didn't understand or know how to help me cope with racist behavior and images I faced at school, in media, etc... I also was bullied at school and had a lot of stress about that. \n\nNow I'm in my 40s, chronically stressed, obese, persistent depression, and various health issues doctors don't understand and dismiss, and on antidepressants which help a little. I don't take mind altering substance (alcohol, canabis other drugs etc...) but I do periodically binge on caffeine. Even as a kid I was hypervigilant. I would get adults to tie me up with skipping rope to practice getting free if I were ever kidnapped (because I'd see people getting kidnapped in TV shows).\n\nI spend my days plagued by fears of harassment and persecution for being Black, and taking in the trauma of the past and how it affects me and other Black people today, both African and diaspora.  I also think about climate change a lot and collapse because of how politically unstable the world is. In short, I think we are truly fucked in a lot of ways. It's not just the environment, is politics and financial collapse, etc... Not just Black people, but people in general. It all scares and upsets me. It upsets me as a woman too, and I'm glad I'm reaching an age where most men won't want to bother raping me when there are younger women and girls around, but I still worry for them.\n\nI've read \"The Body Keeps The Score\" and it was helpful up to a point.  People say you need to be Part of the problem is that my trauma is about hypervigilance and worry. Another part is that no one is ever completely \"safe,\" and the darker your skin is and the more you are a woman, the less safe you usually are. \n\nMy health cannot handle this. I need to become resilient. I need to work on treating my trauma and overcoming my hypervigilance and fear. I need to do this while being resilient to the fact that while threats are not the highest for me personally in this time and place, they still exist. I have some things that help a little: repeatedly hearing about why my trauma is normal, understanding and being reminded that I am not alone and that my story and experience and fears and threats I face are not unique, and that there is some solidarity in that. \n\nBut I need more. I need to be able to somehow cement that hope and peace I get from feelings of solidarity from a momentary to a permanent thing. I think I need to also find something to *believe in.* Something *more* important and valuable than just hiding from or fearing whatever horrors my foremothers and forefathers faced or whatever risks exist today or in a potential future. I need to shift out of the mindset of hypervigilance and running mental scenarios of either how to \"win\" a situation where I'm facing oppression, marginalizing and threat, or fearing the worst and faced with nothing but doom. This can't be based on \"people will think of green techno solutions\" because I don't believe in that and even if it existed I don't know if we'd use it or if it would arrive fast enough. \n\nI also meditate 20 minutes a day. I'm open to EMDR but not a therapist because I don't feel I really need to spend money on that. I've spent money on a variety of therapists and I don't mostly feel they help.

It was just weak and silly attempts to get me back talking, nothing substantive or genuine.\n\nOne of them called me today and I ignored the calls but a few hours later, decided to, idk show one last bit of respect for our long friendship, so I texted her basically saying I'm done for a while with the group.\n\nAnd I'm not sure why I did. It proceeded to just deflection, blaming me for my reaction, taking words I said they were being and thrown back at me, glossing over my points, and justifying things that weren't even relevant. They couldn't fathom why I was hurt by their behavior and just kept resorting back to me being hurtful to them by ghosting them and unfollowing them. I did NOT ghost them, I stated I was not up for the plans anymore. Rather than backing off and giving me space, they continued to try to invade. Our conversation, needless to say, when nowhere. Any regret I had for my decision disappeared.\n\nAnd so I come here to say, just cut them off. It doesn't matter if they \"raised\" you, if you've been friends forever, if you've gone through war together, if you still love each other, whatever. It doesn't matter who's right, who's wrong, who used a harsh tone, who overreacted, literally nothing.\n\nIf people keep making you uncomfortable and you don't feel like they're respecting you, just leave each other the hell alone.

It’s an interesting one. (I just googled and it seems to be related to Mahler’s Separation-Individuation Stages). I may be wrong but I do remember reading about such stages in a book once and interested to hear more, especially if I am wrong.\n\nIn a healthy relationship though, the child can always come back to the caregiver, while here, there is no going back to unhealthy people who resembled the ones who should’ve given care… \n\nHonestly, OP, I’ve been going through similar realizations about my former friends who I’ve quietly stopped talking to. They all reminded me of my abusive mother in some way and we were all just traumatized people triggering each other. I couldn’t take it anymore.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "Thank you! I was just reading something sort of related to how they operate. One thing described was \"pathological envy\" where maybe they get triggered by you trying to get care and understanding from them when they could never get that from their parents, so they feel a need to \"knock you down a peg\" or \"put you in your rightful place\". \\[The rest of this post is just conjecture based on things I may have read before from various sources that vary in credibility.\\]\n\nSo they can't stand any criticism (raised by overly critical parents who expected them to be perfect so they internalized it, but fuck 'em for behaving this way) so you saying they did anything wrong makes them feel attacked to their core foundational self. \n\nThey can't believe they could do any wrong, so their brain makes up stories to justify their pursuing aggression towards you, which comes out as DARVO. \n\nThe aggression is used as a way to regulate themselves, and try to maintain their control over you. It's a wild thing to think about but their abuse of other people actually makes them feel better. Relieved. Righteous, even. They feel entitled to your good will or something. Idk. \n\n\\-\n\nAs for the individuation, it's supposedly turning inward to discover the self (according to Carl Jung). I wonder if that's part of why I need so much alone time (away from potentially harmful people, making up for forever?). Or it can be exploring the external world too (According to Mahler). I do that sometimes by myself, but I can't do it too often or I get overwhelmed. Maybe it's my system's way of having me do things at a manageable pace. My version of this is hyperindependence, I think (not the healthiest)... Finding out my beliefs, being present with my feelings and thoughts to slowly gain confidence in my own decisions. Decision-making definitely did get wrecked for me.   \n  \nI guess if anything, a therapist could become that home base for you, but good therapists are hard to find.

Any disagreement, even quiet independence, was treated as disrespect. He constantly put my mother, my sister, and me down — verbally for most of my life, and physically when I was younger.\n\nIn 2017, he lost his job. What bothered him most wasn’t being unemployed, but the fact that my mother was working and he felt like he was “living off her money.” He pushed her to quit and start a business with him instead, promising that they’d be partners and that she could work comfortably from home. What actually followed was years of him treating her like a subordinate employee — constant criticism, humiliation, and rage. I still remember being 14 and trying to comfort my mother while she cried, telling me that even her previous boss never treated her this badly.\n\nEventually, she emotionally checked out of the business and became a homemaker. Then the abuse just changed form. She was now called “unproductive,” “useless,” and a burden. He said cruel things openly — that she was eating his waste, that others in the family were dogs living off him.\nAt one point, during a fight, he attacked her with a knife. She was injured and bleeding. Afterward, he called the neighbors and rushed her to a doctor. He has never taken responsibility for it and still frames himself as the victim. The physical violence stopped after that, but the verbal abuse never did.\n\n\nI survived by staying quiet and shrinking myself. Eventually, I moved to another city for college just so I could breathe and feel safe. Years later, when I came home with a good job offer (ironically at a Japanese firm), I hoped things might be different. Instead, his behavior got worse. My success seemed to threaten him — like my independence meant he was losing control again. He became hostile, contemptuous, and emotionally aggressive.\nAfter about a month of this, something in me snapped. I finally said everything I had held in for years — about his need for control, his lack of self-awareness, and the damage he caused. I came close to physically retaliating, and that scared me. I stopped myself because I didn’t want to become him.\n\n\nHis response was to emotionally disown me, telling me never to speak to him again until he’s in the grave.\n\n\nNow I’m left questioning myself.\nI don’t think I was wrong for finally speaking up, but I also know confronting someone like this doesn’t lead to accountability. I keep going back and forth — feeling guilt, doubting myself, and minimizing what happened, especially when I remember moments where he acted “responsible” afterward.\nI’m posting here because I’m trying to make sense of all this with people who understand complex trauma.

I can't think at all. I feel completely gone. I had a photographic memory. I now have complete aphantasia. I have been desperately seeking help for all of my adult life. No treatment has worked. My cognitive ability dropped to the 95th percneilte (sub 130 and not even moderately gifted (grounds for suicide)).

I couldn't mentally load all the symbols necessary in the scale task that resembled elementary algebraic reasoning before the timer's expiration, and this may be attributed to my visual impairment. Can my genius be restored? I can't even play video games. I find everything so exhausting. I can't even start textbooks anymore. I can't reason. I can't play. I feel so stupid.

I am very interested in your analysis.\n\nThank you.\n\nAn EDIT to elaborate on the matter of medical abuse : I have been overmedicated since 11. I have been on some (sometimes null) combination SSRIs, antipsychotics, and stimulants ever since. I am worried that I have permanent brain damage. My parents forced me to take 100 MG of Jornay PM for months. My skin was turning purple and my heart was exploding and shit. I was so gone. I think I was psychotic or something. But I could feel everything just dying and frying. I am worried that I have been permanently annihilated by the compounds. I was on that med for less than a year, but I have been on all sorts of methylphenidate variants over the broader interval. Is there any risk of permanent structural or functional damage?

One of my closest friendships growing up was with a sociopath who ended up using me, abusing me further, and cheating on me with someone with my same name. Now, 6 years later, this is wound is coming up again. I’m in a situationship/deep friendship, i consider him my part-time boyfriend, and honestly he’s my best friend. Problem is, it’s the same situation as before. He’s the one person i trust and open up to in a world i feel judged by and understands the horrors of growing up in abuse, i love him dearly, i can’t really have a “claim” (as awful as that sounds i can’t think of a better way to put the weight a labeled relationship puts on a couple and, in a way, legitimizes it) on him, and,\nanyways to get to the point, he has a coworker that i wouldn’t doubt catches his eye with the same name as me. I want to throw up every time i think about it. I already had a reality check where i had to confront how much my trauma still affects me when a situation came up with his ex, he was honest about it, explained his thought process, and i was presented with the same information by a coworker (we have a messy ass workplace, i will admit) and then freaked out thinking i was being lied to in a situation where i didn’t need to be. That broke the foundation of safety we’ve really built the relationship on. I will regret that for a while, but it showed me where i still need to grow, so im thankful. \n\nAnyways, with the coworker with the same name, i’m thinking of bringing it up and saying if there’s any desire that he wants to act on, i need him to tell me so i can distance myself and detach to not let my betrayal wounds that im still working on take over and get the best of me. he’s someone id love to have a friendship with regardless and i want to preserve that. and even if that happens to be the case, with time i’d still cherish a friendship with him. i know i’m projecting, and i don’t want to put an idea in his head that isn’t there, but i know my mental health and as much as i’ve gone through, this is still relatively fresh and i haven’t confronted it before now. i’m still a little reactive. I’m just not sure where to go from here. \n\nTLDR: i (27f), in a situationship with (34m), am confronting deep relationship trauma with my ex partner/best friend and facing the same situation. do i confront it honestly and head on and risk the relationship or let go of control and work on it myself?

Looking for guidance", "text": "Trigger warning: childhood emotional neglect, family betrayal, bullying, passive suicidal thoughts (no intent), medical neglect, death, abuse\n\nHi everyone. I’m posting here because I’m trying to understand my life through a CPTSD lens and I don’t have anyone safe to talk to in real life.\n\nI grew up in a home where emotions were ignored, punished, or reframed as my fault. From childhood onward, I learned that staying quiet, never expressing anger, and not needing anything was considered “good behavior.” No adult ever took my side — not my parents, not teachers, not school authorities.\n\nHere’s a condensed, anonymized summary of what I went through:\n\nDisenfranchised grief (age ~10):\nMy newborn sister died. My parents left for the hospital and came back without telling me anything. I later found out by overhearing relatives. My dad told me never to ask my mom about it. I wasn’t allowed to see her or know details. I cried alone at night and learned that grief was something to hide.\n\nReligious gaslighting:\nMy parents and other adults repeatedly said “everything happens by God’s will and for good.” This was used to dismiss harm and avoid accountability. Over time, I redirected my anger toward God itself and learned that anger was dangerous or unacceptable.\n\nEmotional neglect &amp; scapegoating:\nMy mom often received sympathy and comfort for her suffering, while my pain was ignored or minimized. When I made neutral observations (for example, about her being on her phone constantly), she escalated it into accusations and cried to my dad. I was forced to apologize even when I hadn’t accused her of anything. Later, when I provided proof that I wasn’t imagining things, my dad blamed me for not noticing earlier.\n\nBoundary violations at home:\nMy mom repeatedly sold my belongings (including gifts from relatives) without my consent. She once threw away my blanket while I was sleeping. My things were never really “mine.” I learned that having attachments wasn’t safe.\n\nSchool bullying with no protection:\nThroughout school, I was bullied by groups of classmates (10–12 students): footballs thrown at my face, hitting arms/thighs, breaking my glasses, writing on my clothes, taking my belongings. When my parents spoke to the principal, I was told to “defend myself.” The principal never intervened. My parents never followed up to ask how I was doing.\n\nMedical neglect (teen years):\nI had severe pain from a kidney stone for about a year. Instead of proper treatment, I was given ineffective medicines and taken to religious healers. Only when it became serious did I receive surgery. Being in pain and not believed left a lasting impact.\n\nSuppressed anger &amp; freeze response:\nI was never allowed to raise my voice or express anger. Even now, when I’m falsely blamed or criticized (at home or in front of relatives like my cousin brother), I freeze, stay quiet, and let it happen. I don’t correct people anymore — I just absorb it.\n\nPublic shaming &amp; constant fault-finding:\nMy dad often criticizes me in front of relatives. Once he criticized how I was sitting in front of my cousin brother — even my cousin said it was fine. Moments like that reinforced that I’m always “wrong” no matter what I do.\n\nBody-based trauma symptoms:\nI experience dissociation (feeling unreal or like I’m in a dream), electric shock–like sensations in my chest/body when thinking about the past, long-standing sleep problems, and shutdown/numbness.\n\nAcademic derailment:\nRepeated stress, lack of support, bullying, and mental health issues led to failed semesters and unfinished education paths. Each failure reinforced shame and the belief that effort doesn’t matter.\n\nCurrent situation:\nI’m 19, recently relocated to a new country with my parents, financially dependent, closely monitored, no job experience, no skills, no savings of my own, and very limited independence. I feel trapped, but I’m also starting to realize that what I grew up with wasn’t normal that too after talking to AI.\n\nI want to be clear: I’m not currently harming myself. What I struggle with is feeling like I’m only existing, not living, and being unable to imagine a good future ending — it just feels blank.\n\nWhat I’m asking for help with:\n\nHow do people with CPTSD start building independence when they have no money, no support system, and a strong freeze response?\nHow do you begin to trust your own perceptions after years of gaslighting by parents and authority figures?\nWhat helped you move from “just surviving” to actually living?\nAre there specific skills, resources, or first steps that helped you when you were starting from zero?\n\nThank you for reading. Even being understood would mean a lot.\n\n“Please don’t repost this elsewhere.”\n\nI had help writing this with AI after I told it my problems in my rough language.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "What precisely is the purpose of an apology?  What does it accomplish?  I suggest it serves two basic, fundamental purposes:\n\n1. To relieve guilt.  It's a way to overcome feeling bad over something I've done.  \n\n2. To obtain forgiveness from the offended person.  \n\nHowever, let's dig into #2 just a bit more.  One of the things that really irks me about forgiveness is that modern society seems hellbent on stretching the definition of forgiveness to an absurd extent.  I prefer the [dictionary definition](https://www.google.com/search?q=forgive&amp;oq=forgive&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhA0gEINTc0M2owajeoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8), which is quite simple and straightforward:\n\n&gt;stop feeling angry or resentful toward (someone) for an offense, flaw, or mistake\n\n***That's it, period.***  To forgive means to stop feeling angry towards someone who did something bad to you.  No more no less.  \n\nThe problem is that so many people want forgiveness to also mean:\n\n* the past didn't happen (oh, it most certainly did)\n* you don't have scars (oh, you most certainly do)\n* things go back to the way they were and we all sing kumbaya and live happily ever after (that's reconciliation, not forgiveness)\n\n(About that last point: forgiveness and reconciliation are two very different things, and it's quite possible to achieve one and without achieving, or even attempting, the other.  Exhibit A: my parents.  They reconciled for many years - long enough to have two more sons - without truly forgiving one another for some truly vile misdeeds, and believe me when I say their divorce was both an eventuality and a bloodbath.)\n\nWith all that as a backdrop, it sounds like your mother has some pretty heavy expectations of what should result from her apologizing to you.  When those expectations aren't met, she becomes hurt all over again.  \n\nIt sounds like she can't or won't understand that there's no rolling back the clock for a replay.  There's only going forward, not backward.  It also sounds like she hasn't forgiven herself, which is truly unfortunate.  \n\nFWIW, I rather envy you for having a parent who is even attempts to make amends.

Then, a few decades after they had started doing the daily damage something happened in their lives which actually showed them that they had been wrong, and that actually taught them that they really should’ve known better and that they had been really dumb to reject all evidence and all advice on that point.

They, regardless, NOW wanted to see us symptom-free, because they somehow believed that knowing better makes it all better. I find this perplexing, as well as inexcusable, because my mother (who was the main abuser) had a sister (still living, and now over 80 years old) who was rendered permanently quadriplegic in her early 20s when a drunk driver T-boned her car while she was out driving with her boyfriend. My mother had thereafter been assuming the majority of my sister’s care, or at least supporting it all financially, ever since then, and she knew very well (as she often said) if the driver could come to her today and say: “I’m really, totally, absolutely, sorry for what I did to your sister, that left her permanently quadriplegic and motivated her boyfriend to dump her immediately, and so on and so forth,“ … well, my mother knew that (if such a marvelous thing had ever happened), no matter how truly, totally sorry the driver was, even the greatest depth of his sorrow and true repentance would not cause my aunt to stand up from her wheelchair and dance across the room and play a perfect game of tennis (which was what she had been doing before the accident, because she had been a tennis pro).           My mom and dad knew this perfectly, and they even agreed when I brought it up as an analogy to what they expected: but they were frank that they did not change what they expected: that intellectually they knew if there was nonsense to expect me to be, suddenly in retroactively, un damaged, as if it had never happened, it was nonsense to expect me to now immediately in retroactively and be, and do everything that might have happened, then I might have had and been and done, if they had that hardly, but in my case, their emotions would not change, they have admitted.

I moved to another continent as soon as I hit adulthood so we would talk mostly on WhatsApp and zoom.\n\nThe last few years of our interactions were so painful for me. I shut down and didn’t offer information about my life. She took that as permission to exclusively talk about herself for our daily 40 mins phone call. That went on for like two years.\n\nEventually, I couldn’t bear it and asked her why she never asks me about my life. Her only interest in me was my academic and professional performance. She freaked out and accused me of giving her PTSD. She made all sorts of hurtful declarations and my stressed brain was falling for it. I did feel deeply guilty and like a cartoon villain whenever we spoke.\n\nBut I live on another continent. I am financially independent and have friends that genuinely care for me. So I grounded myself back to reality. I texted her on WhatsApp. I asked her why she said that I was such an awful cruel bully when she’s literally seen my whole life and she knows that I’m a gentle caring person. Everyone else in my life recognizes that. I know who I am.\n\nShe left me on read lol. Years passed, she didn’t contact me for my birthday, our big religious holidays, nothing. It’s like I didn’t exist for her anymore. I feel like there is a permanent crack in my heart from her abandonment.\n\nThe painful reality is that her absence in my life objectively made everything better. Suddenly, I’m nowhere near as anxious and irritable. I fully embrace living the kind of life I want. Yet I’m haunted by this melancholy; knowing that all the joy and growth I’ve experienced would not be possible without my mom choosing to cut our relationship.\n\nAnyway, I think of her often and missed her enthusiastic NYE celebrations.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "I physically can’t cry or show sadness around people 18F", "text": "I can show anger,no emotion or happiness. But sadness and especially crying I cannot. After I first started to get physically and sexually abused as an 8 year old I became quite a weak sensitive cry baby. I would cry over ANYTHING. Scraped my knee? I’m crying. Someone called me a mean name? I’m crying. Lost my favourite toy? I’m crying. Even anger I’m crying.\n\nBut I can’t anymore. It got me made fun of or hurt worse during the abuse. I’d have to pretend it was all ok. Pretend to like it. When half the time I didn’t like it and wanted to cry. But if I cried I’d get hit or painfully SA’d but when I would be compliant at least my rapist made it so it would feel ok.\n\nIt’s really fucked me up. When I’m around people I cannot cry or show much sadness. Which I guess is a good thing. Don’t want to look like a baby. But it leads to awkward laughter when somethings sad or uncomfortable. At my uncles funeral I was crying all night the night before on my own and after the funeral I was crying too. But I was so awkward during the funeral I didn’t cry and wasn’t able to display any sadness. I even giggled at one point when they showed a video of him playing the guitar when he was younger.\n\nIt was a giggle of awww him in his youth. Which some people got and giggled with me. But some people thought it was insensitive and maybe it was. It did make me emotional seeing a young video of my uncle. But I cannot cry.\n\nThere’s been times people have said or done something that really hurt me. Like recently I tried to have a conversation like with someone I went “Hey Ben! How are you?” And he blew me off and was like “OP I don’t care to talk to you right now” which is really odd. He wasn’t busy. Wasn’t talking to anyone. And I’d just helped him out hugely by getting him on a date with my friend who’s his crush. I was really hurt but I was like “oh ok! Sorry” and did the awkward laugh thing. I felt like crying but luckily nothing would come out because of the fact I was around people. It’s not a conscious effort I physically can’t.\n\nBut I went to the toilet and almost immediately just floods of tears came out. A bit dramatic I know I’m still sort of a cry baby and I’d had a stressful day so I think this was kind of the tip of the iceberg for me that day.\n\nIt makes it awkward sometimes too with displaying sadness. If someone tells me something sad like maybe a relative passed away I have empathy and really do feel sad inside for them but I have to consciously control my face and voice to the able to performatively show sadness.\n\nEven with sex it’s completely different when I’m around the person or afterwards or on my own. When I masturbate I often cry. I guess because of the sexual trauma. It’s uncontrollable on cue just as soon as I orgasm I breakdown like 9/10 times. But when I’m with someone else and we have sex or something I do feel the sadness but cannot display it thank god cause that would be embarrassing. But once I get alone I just cry.\n\nI seem really happy and giddy in all of these examples I’m with people unless I turn it to anger or I consciously work really hard to keep my serious sad face. But even then it’s difficult to show people I’m sad. Which is a blessing and a curse I suppose.\n\nI don’t want to be known as a cry baby but I want to show an appropriate amount of sadness and empathy.\n\nAnd not it turn to anger. There’s an example. My friend told me she isn’t going to be my friend anymore. I was really sad but just seemed numb. I walked away and immediately started sobbing. She found me crying and I couldn’t continue crying anymore or being sad and it turned to anger of me telling her to fuck off and stuff.", "score": 8, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767927305.0, "id": "1q7wla0", "author": "No-Dream9806", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q7wla0/i_physically_cant_cry_or_show_sadness_around/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Does anyone with anxious attachment feel unable to stop sharing their feelings when dysregulated?", "text": "I am processing my behavior and trying to understand why I am having such a hard time keeping it in alignment with my values. I’m trying not fall into a guilt and shame spiral and understand myself more. I’m wondering if my behavior is a manifestation of a “fight or flight” response? Is anyone else here like this?\n\nIn other relationships I am very mindful of boundaries. I am not emotional, I don’t consider myself needy, if anything I’m pretty aloof. But when I am around my boyfriend I feel emotionally defenseless, and if he does something that my mind registers as a threat he’s emotionally “abandoning” me, I feel an overwhelming and basically impossible urge to say something about it. And spill out how I feel unimportant or how sad I feel about how disconnected we are, etc I’ve posted about it before, if you look through my post history.  Once I start I can’t shut up. It doesn’t matter how inconvenient the timing is, etc. And I do and have done this almost every day for almost a year now. It’s like something else takes over and I just can’t stop.\n\nDoing the same thing over and over and over again despite knowing fully how it’s not only NOT effective (although sometimes it does alleviate my anxiety), is pushing your partner away due to disrespecting their boundaries, and is causing yourself immense anxiety….makes me feel stupid, guilty, filled with shame, powerless, hopeless and like I’m going to be alone and homeless. (Even though I know now, if worst came to worst and he moved out, I could afford to pay for rent here on my own). I wouldn’t be like this if I lived alone, and I’m not when I am away from him. When he’s at work I feel my best because there are no triggers. I’m not like this with other people. \n\nI know we are all responsible for our behavior and emotions and it scares me to feel like I can’t control myself. He also doesn’t ever close the door on me or hold firm boundaries, although he has expressed them, so I am not sure if I am blaming myself too much for this toxic, miserable cycle. I will ask him now if I can ask him something, and now he just says “is it going to be an anxiety fueled question or a normal question?” \n\nI don’t know. I hate myself for all of this. I do have other stressors in the background of my mind- like my Mom having symptoms of dementia and my estrangement from my sister who I was until recently pretty close to. And considering my Dad’s already passed, I have no other family now! haha. Good times. \n\nDespite being reasonable and able to compartmentalize everything and strategize everything else in my life, I just cannot for the life of me get a grip on this and I’m trying to understand why. Because my inability to control myself is giving me further anxiety and an unbearable sense of dread. And the idea of us breaking up also gives me an unbearable sense of dread. \n\nI can’t raise my self esteem and climb out of this hole when I feel like I am hopelessly drowning doing the same destructive thing almost every single day. I don’t feel I truly have a sense of agency. I’m in the bottom of a well. In this aspect of my life at least. I’m sure he feels the same. \n\nI feel like he can’t stand me anymore, like I’ve ruined everything and like I am not a priority in his life anymore considering we barely spend any time together since he works all the time, when we do we don’t talk much, and we rarely text each other. I’ve told him just sending a text like “Hey babe, was thinking of you, hope you’re having a good day” or something to help me feel more connected during the week. I’ve said this over and over and he never does. I wasn’t invited to his family’s for thanksgiving or Christmas. \n\nIt feels like a very lonely relationship. He works, has D&amp;D 2 nights a week that he’s always excited for, and has 1 true day off and I feel he’d rather spend it playing his PC than with me. He doesn’t answer 99% of my texts, and rarely texts me. We don’t laugh, we don’t flirt, he doesn’t call me “babe” or anything anymore. I barely feel like I’m his girlfriend and it makes me sad to think of how things are now compared to how they used to be between us, back when he always wanted to hang out with me and told me I was “one of his favorite people to talk to.” \n\nIt makes me endlessly sad to think of what our relationship could be, versus the shell that it is.  \n\nHe told me I’m not on the back burner, or an afterthought, but that he feels like everything he does is wrong, like he has a huge weight on him, like I give him a lot of anxiety and make him feel shitty, like he’s under a microscope and like he’s being controlled. That I don’t give him enough emotional space to recalibrate and rebuild with me if I am constantly finding fault with what he does or doesn’t do. And how it makes him feel powerless to fix it and depressed. Even though he acknowledges that’s not my intent.\n\nWhich is also valid.\n\nAnother random example: He just came home briefly with his coworker and friend that he picked up to take to work. I’ve said hi to his friend before. Neither of them said hey as I passed by. And he didn’t say bye before he left. I feel like if he were in love and happy he would’ve been happy to see me again and happily came to kiss me goodbye before he left.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "how to deal with psychological trauma?", "text": "hi. I'm writing this message through a translator, so I'm sorry if there are any mistakes or unclear words.\nI'm 15 years old now, and when I was 7-10 years old, my older cousin raped me. to be honest, I don't remember exactly how — I still have some isolated cases, but I remember about 10 of them, but I think there were many more. Every summer I went to my grandmother's house and sometimes spent the night with him (and another cousin, but he's not that important), and he often harassed me—touched or licked me, jerked me off, and the like. I remember one time, but I'm not sure if it's true or not, but then he cum on my ass. Until I was 10, I was very afraid to tell anyone about it. In the end, I told my second cousin about it, and we drove him away several times. After that, I stopped being so afraid to talk about violence, so some of my friends knew about it.\n\nHe was quiet for a while. When I was about 12, I came to visit him (by that time he had moved to another city) with my niece. I was much bolder then than before. We were sitting in his room and he was always messing with me. at first, just to touch my hand, and then he started kissing me. I pushed him and told him to stop. towards morning, we went to bed, but I woke up to the fact that he was groping me. I took my niece and we left (she's fine). then I was very scared, so I told my older sister, who lived in the same city with him and my niece. she just laughed at me (but as it turned out, she told my mom about it). I pretty quickly gave up on this situation and what happened before.\n\nwhen I was 13, I discussed this situation with him by correspondence. He said he thought I liked it (I think that's an obvious lie) and was very grateful that I didn't file a police report against him. That's when I found out that my older sister had told my mom about this situation. That day, I burst into tears because my mom didn't do anything. \n\nHe started throwing money at me for my silence, sometimes on my birthday, sometimes on March 8th. One day, I couldn't stand it and told my mom about EVERYTHING. She was very scared and began to blame herself, because she often left me with him. She said that after hearing from my sister, she made one decision — never to cross paths with him. He has never appeared at family parties. to be honest, it didn't help me. Mom said that if I wanted to, she could sign me up for a therapist, to which I replied that I didn't know. After a couple of months, I said I wanted to, but she refused. at the moment, the situation has not moved. I blocked this cousin in all social networks, banks, and he stopped transferring money to me. I still haven't seen a therapist.\n\nSo that's what I'm talking about.: What should I do in this situation? I think I have cptsd (I've had nightmares a lot before, lots of triggers, flashbacks, and blackouts). but to be honest, it seems to me that I made all this up and nothing really ever happened to me, even if there is evidence of this. I often feel like I'm just pushing for pity and my problems aren't really that big and I can tolerate them. I don't think I've suffered enough to talk about it, that it's my own fault if I've been silent for a long time. If you have any questions, please ask them so that I can help myself and you can help me. I will update the post as I answer the questions.\n\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767919341.0, "id": "1q7tjgf", "author": "This-Bodybuilder-551", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q7tjgf/how_to_deal_with_psychological_trauma/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "Those of us who live with this disorder often think that we \"don't suffer enough\" to consider it \"serious,\" but the reality is that it's difficult to process situations like this, especially as a child or teenager. It's very brave of you to seek help and confront several people involved. Personally, no one in my family or among my friends knows that I suffered abuse at the hands of my father when I was very, very young. It took me a very long time to even process it on my own. Now I'm 24 and have a \"stable\" life, but at the same time, I deal with the devastating effects of this disorder. It affects every aspect of my life, and what comforts me most is that you're still young enough to do something about it. It's a difficult path, but believe me, you can find reasons to move forward and, above all, avoid situations that this same trauma can cause. Besides therapy (in my case, I'm seeing a cognitive behavioral therapist), it's very important to have a strong support network. Remember, it's not always family; it can also be friends.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "I have always felt alone", "text": "I know it’s because of the way I grew up. No one was safe. I lived with an abusive mom. My dad is out of the picture. My sister and older brother were the only ones that understood but they moved out as soon as they could. I was stuck with her for years. They are adults and living their own lives. I can’t go to someone consistently. I will not make someone my therapist. I can’t fully open up about how heavy this weight is because I am viewed differently. It is inevitable. I have been to therapy a few years ago. It helped me understand how to cope with panic attacks and deal with day to day life with extreme anxiety. But now it’s just my mind. Positive thoughts don’t change the reality of things. I don’t hate myself. But I feel so fucking alone. I feel out of place talking or opening up to anyone. They view you with pity or say maybe you should talk to a therapist, but for me that has never solved the inability to fully connect to others. To stop feeling the hyper awareness and self criticism. To feel out of place in every group setting. To feel like you are never expressing yourself properly. I am very timid with people to the point they act like I am not as aware of situations as I truly am. I have very bad ADHD and struggle with being constantly forgetful and aloof. I know that people see me in this way. I play it off as a joke around others and use humor to deflect it. But it is a genuine struggle. I am constantly thinking, my brain does not turn off. I am often in my own mind instead of being fully connected to reality. It feels safer there. But I am evaluating everything constantly. I feel very misunderstood and unseen by others, even by my friends who care for me the most. I can’t shake the feeling of being alone.\n\nI was kicked out of my mom’s house because her boyfriend attacked me. He went to jail and she told me I was not welcome back. She kept my social security card and all of my important documents. I was already thinking about the military, and after getting kicked out I knew I had to. I had no other choice. I graduated high school and my mom would not help me get my life together to be independent. My dad who is living in another state would not let me stay with him. I stayed with two different friends until one of my other friends said I could live with them until I left for bootcamp. I am very grateful, but we ended up having issues after 6 months. It was amazing being with them and I felt like my friend’s mom became a mother figure to me. She helped me order all the documents I needed to work and to enlist. I got my first job living with them. But then things started changing… I got a new boyfriend and spent a lot of time with him, and I had two days off a week. I would split it between being with him and my friends. My friend who I lived with felt entitled to my time. She was an only child. They started treating me differently. I lived in a tiny spare room they had, when my friend originally had two rooms to herself. It was very cramped and when I got ready in the morning, even after cleaning it, clothes would be out and she would come in and tell me to clean up. The crazy thing is my space was much cleaner than hers considering she had food everywhere and clothes. The room I stayed in was probably a 10x10 ft space, and fitting everything I owned in there was hard. They started treating me like a burden. I did the dishes every day, and would only eat their leftovers. I was working until night and came back when everyone was sleeping and stay in that room, then repeat the next day. My friend hated my boyfriend and wanted me to break up with him. Her mom started disrespecting me and treating me like a burden as well as my friend. It started over a simple mistake. My curfew is 10 PM, and one night I came in an hour after because my boyfriend said he was leaving to a different state and that would be my last time seeing him because I would be in bootcamp by then. I was going to have a sleepover somewhere else and stayed with him the whole night instead because of what he told me. I had work so I decided to come back, but I was locked out and had to knock and it disturbed them awake to open the door (I’m not sure if they intentionally locked it because I have the code to come inside. The bottom handle was locked). This was a ONE TIME mistake that never happened again, and my friends mom threatened to kick me out if it happened again. Everything became a nightmare. The people I thought I could trust and be vulnerable with turned out to be a lie. They never understood how I felt or have gone through anything remotely close. No matter how respectful I was to them, or how many chores I offered to do, it was never enough. I felt like a parasite around them, even though my dad sent them money to take care of my needs (that’s all he knows what to do). I can go into so much more detail but eventually she kicked me out. I had to pack for bootcamp, and she told me to do it the day my friend came from another state to visit me before I left was getting there. I told her no, and that I was going after the visit and I knew everything I had to get. It was still over a week before I left, and I was going to do it with my boyfriend in a few days. I didn’t need much (or anything) because they give you necessities when you get there, and I knew that. After I said I was planning on another day, she gets mad. She comes into the room and tells me, “You stress me out and I want you gone”. I packed all my shit that day and stayed with my grandma until I shipped out (she was not an option to live with in the beginning) The micromanagement was horrible. And I felt like I could never say anything about the disrespect because they were taking care of my basic needs because I was homeless. It reinforced the fact that I really was misunderstood by the people around me, and that people can hear your story and feel bad but never truly get how it is.\n\nNow, I have been in for at least 9 months. My friends who helped take care of me at my lowest, who were my world, feel so distant. We are all living separate lives. We went from speaking every day to every few weeks, to barely at all. I am away from everyone. And now I feel like i’m back to square one. I was lucky finding genuine people, but it took years. I’ve been in for this long and have not found a close friend to truly open up to. It is very hard. I feel like I do not have anyone anymore. Even when I got to visit them during Christmas, I felt even more disconnected and alone. They are the only true friends I have and now we live separate lives. I feel deeply lonely. And even if I communicate this no one will be able to fully relate or understand it. Now it feels inappropriate to start confiding in them in the same way when I lived there. They are both busy with their lives, and I am busy with mine. I have had this heavy feeling for such a long time, surrounded by people or not. Joining made it worse. I am grateful to start a career and have my needs taken care of, but I don’t think I will ever stop feeling alone.", "score": 9, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767916491.0, "id": "1q7se71", "author": "percwafflez", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q7se71/i_have_always_felt_alone/"}

I feel a bit hopeless, too. I also get a sense of both comfort and fear as these emotions come up for me…like in reaction to these songs and shows bringing these feelings up. The songs are usually sad or haunting songs, but they touch a deep part of me still. The shows are usually dark (Criminal Minds for example). I don’t have these feelings come up with other sad songs that I’ve stumbled across in adulthood or dark shows. Not even for the more recent criminal minds seasons or the reboot.\n\nTyping this out, it’s occurred to me that it could be emotional flashbacks.

I grew up in a very abusive home and I’ve been sa’d 4 times in my life with 2 of them being family members. Without going down the long long list, the physical and emotional abuse I faced growing up was super severe, and being the oldest didn’t help. Black eyes, busted lips, my jaw was damaged for a while, I once got frostbite in both of my legs after having to sit outside for like 6 hours, and couldn’t walk for a while, the list goes on but it was a lottt. I didn’t even celebrate my birthday past 15. I did fight back most of the time it just never helped. Outside of that, I was always fighting at school, and racism in HS didn’t help it all. It was all helpful I guess in the way that I didn’t take shit from anybody before and I really don’t know but that’s probably all. Even with no support system I’m ok. Most, if not all, of my trauma has been shoved to the back of my mind and forgotten so I couldn’t explain it all if I needed to. But, I’m in college now, and unpacking what I remember, I haven’t cried since like 13. I always think through emotions instead of feeling them which I think is a part of it. I’ve always gotten stressed to the point of severe headaches too. I’m not sure what at all it’s related to but I haven’t cried in so many years. For the past 2 years, whenever I try to cry I feel nothing but physical pain. I tried to cry the other day and got nothing but the most painful cramp in my entire torso, chest, and back I couldn’t do anything but curl up in a ball. It felt like the worst pain in my life and not being able to cry made it 1000x worse.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Can having seen/heard your parents having sex really affect you in any way?", "text": "Well, all of this stems from the fact that from a very young age (4-5 years old) I was exposed to a lot of sexual content by my parents. I always slept in the same room with them, and they ended up having sex next to me (my mom even emphasized it) more than once. On one occasion, my mother had just bathed me, and if I remember correctly, she left me there waiting for quite a while with the towel on. I decided to leave the bathroom on my own and went to OUR room, only to find them in the act. When I was 6 years old, my dad would look for porn on my iPad, and I would stumble across many of those sites frequently. My dad would even punish me for having them open when it was his responsibility; I just wanted to play video games. Even though it wasn't my fault, he made me feel like it was.\n\nWhen I was 15, I would hear noises from them in their room some nights (my younger sister and I already had our own rooms by then). One of those nights, I had just gotten out of the shower and was leaving my room after putting on my pajamas. I went to hang up my towel, and I heard those same noises coming from their room; the door wasn't completely closed. I don't know what came over me; maybe it was an impulse that made me knock once, twice, until I opened it. I opened the door (stupidly), saw them, and was in shock. All the memories came flooding back, and I ran back to my room while they stopped as soon as I opened the door, and then they scolded me. I know, I made a huge mistake, but at that moment I was only thinking about my sister (who was probably already asleep) and the fact that I wanted to sleep peacefully, but no, I didn't sleep peacefully. It sounds stupid, but I was gripped by a terrible panic and couldn't stop shaking. I was selfish, I know, but I think they were partly selfish too for never considering me because, of course, I was just a kid, I didn't know what they were doing, and they think that gives them the right to do it right next to me. Anyway, since that night, nothing has been the same. It's like it only affects me more than it already did. Usually, at night, even during the day, this would happen to me:\n\n* **Hypervigilance:** Hearing noises even when there aren't any, my own brain imagining a threat so it doesn't take me by surprise again.\n* **Intense Images and Chills:** Flashbacks and images that come to my mind without me seeking them out or trying to force them.\n\nThe only thing I got for all this was violence and scolding. They told me it wasn't a big deal and that it was their house, so they could do whatever they wanted. My parents were completely oblivious to the situation, and I deal with this alone today.\n\nNow, in the present, I'm 16, almost 17, and it seems I haven't completely escaped this because I'm still hypervigilant, and images of them suddenly appear in my mind, maybe not as intensely as before, but they're still there. Every night I try to distract myself or listen to music, although I don't think anything really happened because, like I said, I don't know if it's me or them anymore. I feel a strong aversion to having sex, which is even more conflicting because I have a girlfriend, and of course, we're not thinking about it right now **(clarification)**, but even when she touches my waist, I don't know what it is, it gives me this tingling sensation, but not in a pleasant way, more like an emergency or warning sign.

My dad clearly witnessed it, confirmed it and didn’t intervene and our relationship is non-existent for this and other reasons.\n\nI got a “boyfriend” at 13 to feel normal and try to forget about how undesirable and dirty I felt, but he also touched me when I didn’t want him to because he was a boundary pusher and I was too scared to say anything. He would repeatedly touch me in public and pull me toward him when I said clearly I didn’t want to do that. I broke whatever it was off and haven’t been in a relationship since.\n\nSince then, any form of physical contact, sexual, platonic etc has sent my brain into panic and overstimulation. I still crave it, in a safe way, and I cry a lot from making myself feel so undesirable because I can’t be touched.\n\nOne of my male friends is very aware of this and he and his fiancée are the only people I feel safe enough around to hold hands, hug etc. Because they ask me for permission even if they’re just brushing past me or tapping me on the shoulder. They’ve created an environment where they don’t touch me unless I’ve explicitly given my consent. There’s a running joke where even if we are drunk and we’re hanging off each other we still ask “Am I okay to touch you?” \n\nI’ve come to the realization that I want to be touched in a safe way, not even sexually just in a nice way. On the arm, shoulder, back etc. I want to have a romantic relationship where I fully trust the other person not to take advantage of me. I want sex and intimacy and closeness. I have rejected it for long enough.\n\nI’ve been micro-dosing it with piercings and tattoos, where the artist/piercer has to touch you. It’s a good exercise in trying not to freak out and I haven’t had any meltdowns I can recall. I even had my nipples pierced and felt giddy after, but in a good way, the piercer was so lovely and helped me stay calm. I want to be covered in tattoos someday and I would like it to be part of the journey of accepting what happened to me.\n\nAnyway, I hope this has made sense to everyone reading it. I’ve been through therapy for my touch-revulsion which I initially thought was my autism and only recently uncovered the repressed memory. Now I realize I have to go through it to get over it and have what I want: a relationship with good, honest and purposeful intimacy for both of us.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767912926.0, "id": "1q7qx15", "author": "Comfortable_Pride557", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q7qx15/healing_through_longing/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "My family are orks", "text": "Long long LONG LOOOOOOOONG story very short my brother was one of mine and my mom's abusers when I was a kid. After our parents split I went with mom he went with dad. My father is a literal demon and my brother took to his way of thinking VERY easily. Eventually we dropped contact and about 16 years later shocker my brothers life was in tatters and he asked mommy to save him. I backed my mom up but I knew how this would end. This was about 4 years ago. We drove accross the country and picked him up. Skip ahead he's married 100k a year job and a home owner and he's STILL a belligerent abusive lying fucking drunk. \n\nWhich leads to my recent emotional break through. After the abuse I survived I got SEVERE cptsd and a coping mechanism was I learned martial arts. I am VERY fucking good at fighting as a result but I've always been super paranoid about other humans and I've always thought all of humanity is just a coiled spring of violence waiting to break and tear each other apart. This, to put it lightly, has made me VERY FUCKING MISERABLE! \n\nThe breakthrough i had goes like this. So my brother got black out drunk AGAIN and started yelling at my mom and I AGAIN about how we're horrible people and parasites and white trash (he also called us the N word which is weird cuz were Irish lol) and it escalated BAD! After a back and fourth he attacked me but forgot that im WAY bigger than him now. He tried to choke me... I promptly slammed him into the ground and got full mount on him. I pinned him and kept saying \"CMON BE VIOLENT BE LIKE HIM FUCKIN HURT ME!\" And each attempt he made i would pin him. I never struck him but I toyed with him to show that he LITERALLY can't fucking hurt me. After that cops get called I cut him out of my life etc etc.\n\nAfter the fight though I realized that for SIXTEEN years when he wasn't around I NEVER got violent. I realized that the violence I encountered was from him, my dad, and just growing up and going to school in the south with all the hill billies lol.\n\nAnd after I whooped his ass I realized \"holy shit... ITS JUST MY FAMILY! THEYRE ORKS!!!\" I finally figured out that if my family isn't around I am peaceful MY LIFE IS PEACEFUL! Humans ARENT, for the most part, violent psycho mother fuckers. But my family are orks.\n\nFor context I love a franchise called warhammer 40k. In 40k there's a race of aliens called green skins and or orks. They're this bio weapon left over from a war millions of years ago that never had an off switch installed. Orks in the setting LITERALLY need to fight. They have a biological drive to \"have a scrap\" and if they don't they get fat, sad, and eventually die. My family NEEDS to fight NEEDS to yell! But not me. Not the rest of humanity. And like that BAM my fear and paranoia evaporated. Im finally able to start socializing. Things have been crazy since the fight but im back on my feet now and im going to start trying to form social circles now. \n\nTo anyone else grappling with trust issues and hurt. Just remember your abuser? Theyre just orks. That's how they are.

I wanted to talk and to understand, did he think i seemed like I wanted that? No answer.  12:15, 12:30.  New Year’s Day, he just leaves and doesn’t know his engagement ring is in his pocket.  Then silence. can someone please help me to process this? What kind of behavior was it? What were the intentions? Was it planned or did it just strike him and he went with it?  not looking for therapy just if anyone knows what a person is thinking when they do this i want to hear it", "score": 20, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": 1767909824.0, "id": "1q7pl0v", "author": "Ill_Celebration_4201", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1q7pl0v/cognitive_dissonance_he_was_my_best_friend_my/"}

That I mattered, that I was capable of feeling loved. I never really felt that as a kid, and to finally feel it and lose it was devastating. I'm not sure I can even convey the extent in words.\n\nI don't feel like romantic relationships are something I want to engage in again. I feel like if I did start another relationship I'd either make myself too vulnerable and experience that loss again, or be emotionally detached to avoid the pain when the relationship does fall through. I'm guessing there's a middle ground, but it's really hard to see.\n\nI know I have family that do really love me. But it's like that feeling when somebody tells you that they're proud of you, and you don't really get why? It's just something you feel people are supposed to say, and even if it's genuine from them you don't have the capacity to feel it. Because you've never been proud of yourself. You've never loved yourself. What real reasons would you have anyway, especially having spent your childhood being made repeatedly to feel the opposite?\n\nUnconditional love from someone is what I really want. But it's not something I'll ever get. I'll always know now in the back of my mind it can fall apart. People say you'll regret not putting yourself out there just to avoid being hurt.

It was made worse by the fact that I'm 17 and that teenage romance is often seen as trivial and petty, so I couldn't really vent about it to anyone. I felt so much more isolated and ashamed of it.\n\nThe only real positive thing from it is that it allowed me to fully understand the true extent of my trauma, how my neglect and isolation as a child was manifested in my attachment, and it allowed me to be able to fully confront and accept it.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "title": "Question for those both afflicted with CPTSD and for partners of those with the diagnosis.", "text": "So, I am in a long term relationship with someone who has a diagnosis of CPTSD.  She's great in many ways, inspires creativity in everyone around her, can be incredibly empathetic, very intelligent, and beautiful. \n\nShe and I have reached sort of a make or break point in the relationship. We go through periods of fighting, and closeness, ups and downs. One of the more annoying things she does is that she loves to be the authority on health and or mental health. As I've told her many times, I love a good hypothetical, I love new inputs, but I also have a point where I'd really rather not talk about a subject anymore, I'm over it. I feel as though nothing I tell her is retained, or, the message I am trying to convey at any given time is somehow misunderstood or mistranslated into having a completely different meaning. \n\nI have also been diagnosed with ADHD, as has she. Were the classic anxious avoidant couple. Her being anxious, me being a good Midwestern type that was raised not to talk about emotions, but I'm trying to be better?\n\nWe have both delved into various mental health/couples communication/building secure relationships etc sort of resources on plenty of occasions but nothing seems to stick. I feel that she is not open to observations or opinions on on behaviors I've noticed that upon further research are symptoms of CPTSD, instead wanting to be the one with the plan so to speak. \n\nAbout a year ago, hoping to show her some of the things she does, and hoping to in turn get called out on toxic behaviors myself, I proposed we export and upload 2.5 years worth of text messages to an appropriately prompted AI, to then analyze for patterns and so on. We received a decent report of good and bad things. I've tried gently showing her things she does that she may not be aware of, in the moment, in general bullshitting etc, but it seems to be brushed off as \"you don't know what you're talking about because I've been to more therapy than you have...\" Or the classic \"oh yeah well, what about.\" \n\nI love her very much, but all the fights, the emotional rollercoasters, etc have me BURNT THE FUCK OUT. I have plenty of my own stressors and issues that I can't necessarily rely on her to be present for. I've told her more than once, that it seems to me, that the only way to bring true attention to an issue I have, is to evoke some kind of strong emotional response in her. Which is not sustainable at all. \n\nI'm also the sole one on the mortgage, I pay all of the bills, I'm the cook, I feel the domestic duties are not split at all. Don't get me wrong, she chips in, but it is inconsistent at best. I've tried asking for more reliable help with bills, chores, etc, and it can be overdone for awhile, to the point of her burning out. Or, she swoops in and begins to tell me how I'm doing something wrong... I just don't know\n\n\nThis is a brief summary of the relationship. Not saying I've been perfect over the course of it either. I've fucked up plenty of times by being dismissive, defending my position, being pushed to the point of being angry and petty etc. \n\nWe've tried couples therapy, but I feel that she fawns and takes over the sessions, then hyper focuses on things I should do, while ignoring things the therapist has said she needs to do. \n\n\nI know there are resources out there. I've tried implementing validation techniques. I've tried to be reassuring. And even in those cases, she doesn't seem to register what I'm saying or doing. \n\n\nWhat are good resources to help couples in similar situations? I've done a fair bit of googling. Tried finding rules to healthy conflicts. Tried reassuring. Tried validating. Tried listening. Tried shutting my mouth and letting her say what she needs to.\n\nDo we need a couples therapist that's trauma informed? Books? Podcasts? YouTube how to videos? \n\n\nThere's been a lot of hurt on both sides. A lot of happiness and good times too. But, the negative has a tendency to stick in the mind a little better than the good. \n\n\nThe American education system didn't prepare either of us for this. What the fuck is one to do in order to better the relationship? Or is the whole thing just fucked? She really is a beautiful person that has endured some horrible things. I want to try and achieve that secure relationship with her, but I'm just exhausted and have no idea what will or can stick.

I currently have no recollection of this, but I would’ve been about 3/4/5 at the time. It was committed by another distant adult family member.\n\nSince then, I have cut off that whole side of my family without much fuss seeing as I was never close to them and always in fact had negative feelings about them growing up (now I see why). However, I’m having issues with my relationship to my father since then. The offender was on his side of the family, and according to the recollection, he was told about the incident but brushed it off at the time saying “he was probably just playing around”\n\nNow, after being confronted with this, he said he doesn’t remember anything and he’s sorry that this happened. Through it’s been extremely painful for me, it didn’t seem like the news has broken him up too much at all, and I’m wondering if he even fully believes it/his part in it. He said “I wish I would’ve known” but I believe he did know and minimized it. He’s the type that avoids confrontation at all costs and likes to keep up appearances.\n\nAnyway, since this happened I’m wondering if I need to cut him off as well. What happened was absolutely disgusting and I’m not understanding his reaction to it, it’s almost like he doesn’t really care at all. He knows how I feel about them, but I actually don’t even know if he’s still in contact with his family. He doesn’t mention anything about them and I feel like I would never know since I don’t think he would tell me the truth.\n\nI’m trying to reconcile this news with the dad I thought I knew up until this point, as I had an ok childhood as far as I knew (though I don’t remember anything at all before about 6) and the only thing I would’ve said was that he was emotionally distant. Does this incident of 20 years ago erase the good times we had? Does he actually remember? Would I be better off healing without him?

I decided I would rather be alone than surrounded by people who drain me, disrespect me, and secretly resent me.\n\nFrom now on, I only want to be around people who have a good heart above everything and capable of kind without seeing me as a commodity first and who bring something raw and human to the table.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "CPTSD", "text": "My husband and I both have CPTSD.  We’ve met many other people with trauma like that and have always tried to be a safe, supportive person for them to vent to and receive reassurance.  Just to be a friend to listen, empathize, and give a hug if it’s not online. \n\nWhich, 98% of the time, meant that we were slowly turned into unpaid (and under qualified) therapists for them. When the “friendship” turns into to them just trauma and negativity dumping on you every time you speak, it eats away at your mental health and energy *fast.*  Typically, no amount of communication pointing out the issue changed it long term and we had to cut off that person (or usually they cut us off once we stopped engaging in their negativity). \n\nWe’ve learned to set boundaries by now; friendship is a two way give and take.  *Both* parties should get something out of it, and by and large both parties should feel better after interactions instead of one a lot better and the other like shit. \n\nI feel so, so bad when I see posts on here by people talking about how they lose all their friends once they start exposing their trauma, because I *know* no one does this on purpose.  There are so many people walking around with so much hurt and no one to talk to about it, and they’re scared to (or don’t have access to) truly face it with a therapist. \n\nBut one important part of healing is learning not to set yourself on fire to keep others warm, and another is to not ask other people to do that to themselves (even unintentionally).  It’s difficult and takes intentionality, especially if you haven’t had a close friend to talk to in a while.\n\nEdit: to be clear, I’m absolutely not saying that you shouldn’t be able to share your trauma with your friends. But it shouldn’t be all one way, shouldn’t be the only thing you guys talk about, and if it still cuts that deep it should be being addressed with a therapist as well.", "score": 40, "created_utc": 1767915245.0, "id": "nyhwa2t", "author": "brelywi"}

Just cut off/not allowing access to me period. And that 90% of women are gossipy bitches that are unreliable and will absolutely throw you under the bus for their gain. I dont need to be okay with that and I dont need ro offer myself as a sacrifice.\n\nI think you are in a similar position OP. And Im glad you had that realization. Accepting it at first was hard for me too, but man, people WILL come around that actually respect you.

The second was very toxic too but they guy got too deeply into drugs and wouldnt get off. Leads to nasty things so I left. With female friendships I had really bad experiences too. Bullying, them suddenly leaving me and declaring me as a toxic monster with no explanation etc. Then my relationship with my mom got really bad (she involved herself in one of my breakups it wasnt nice)\nAnd I randomly got a video suggested on the dating strategy stuff. Ate that stuff up. My bad friendships gave me the urge to NOT pursue any friendships for a while. Theres been signs all along Ice never really listened to it and decided to just trust my gut because most of the time it was right. Being used by men also made me go celibate for a few years until the right guy came along that actually respected my boundaries and was happy to take things at my pace and not force anything. Wouldve cut him off otherwise. Ruthlessly.\n\nI also met a new group of friends, and I am now more distanced and dont open up so quickly with people. Until I feel like I can trust them. I pay a great deal of attention to how people make me feel and pursue the friendships that nourish me. Avoiding and not pursuing what doesnt.\n\nIt was very sobering to realize that most people are not good. But somehow you come to terms with it. I read advice on not having close male friends as a woman and after that BOTH of my close male friends who I really cherished stood me up. Sometimes it still stings, but you know they mattered to me more than I to them. So as heartbreaking as it was Im better off without them.\n\nDont wanna bash men too much, women get really nasty too. But women are more quiet war gossip kind of people usually. Got into a friendgroup that was very gossipy,  then they turned on me. There was verbal abuse, threats, and even a complaint to the teachers (was still in school then) about my „inacceptable“ behavior, loud gossip about me purposefully so I could hear. Very nasty.\n\nBut meeting my new friends, sniffing them out first and opening up gradually, noticing that the dynamic is healthy and noone crosses anyones boundaries. That healed me. A friendship that left me inspired and nourished forthe first time in my life, actually was the click friendshipwise. Because I know how it can be and if a friendship doesnt feel nourishing then I dont feel very motivated to pursue it further.\n\nBut yeah, I guess the thing is to realize it, and then cut people off. Family is tricky.\n\nFriendships ironically work best if you have enough self respect that you will ruthlessly cut people out of your life if they misbehave.

Each small action builds that muscle.
