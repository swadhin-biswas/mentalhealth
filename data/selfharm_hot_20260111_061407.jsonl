{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfharm", "title": "\"Is This Self-Harm?\" Megathread", "text": "The answer to this question will vary from person to person, but generally, causing yourself deliberate self injury in any way counts as self harm. \n\nThis includes but is not limited to:\n\n* scratching\n* cutting\n* burning\n* interfering in the healing process of wounds\n* pulling out hair\n* starving\n* purging\n* breaking bones\n* excessive drug use (including alcohol)\n\n# Why do people self harm?\n\nFor many people, there is not one single reason why they self-harm, but rather a combination of multiple factors which ultimately push people to use self-harm as a coping mechanism. If you are self-harming, the following list may help you understand your emotions, or alternatively if you're trying to help someone who is self-harming, then understanding why they do it in the first place is important to know.\n\nThis list is non-exhaustive and not mutually exclusive.\n\n* To match the outside to the inside. People are in so much emotional pain and they want people to know it. They want to look the same as they feel.\n* To punish themselves. Extreme self-loathing leads to the need to punish oneself for failings (real or imagined).\n* To numb themselves. The pain releases endorphins, just like drugs can. It produces a numbing effect on the mind which is difficult to explain. It helps people forget depression for a bit.\n* To keep control. One's own body sometimes seems like the only thing they can control, and the pain they inflict on it. When everything else in life goes wrong and there seems to be nothing you can do, cutting is the one thing you can control.\n* As a shock to a numb mind. An awful emotionlessness often accompanies depression. Often, the pain of cutting is enough to snap a person out of this kind of apathetic haze.\n* To self-medicate. Many people with mental illnesses of all sorts use cutting as others might use Prozac. It makes people feel normal again, by snapping them out of the cloying darkness that's so difficult to avoid by conventional means.\n* As an addiction. A lot of people start cutting for one of the reasons listed above, but then continue because they're addicted to the sudden, low exchange, rush of endorphins.\n\n  \nKeep it respectful, demeaning and rude comments will not be tolerated.\n\n(description: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/wiki/self-harm \n\nTaken from our Wiki.

I've been supportive all the way through and didn't make a big deal out of it all.\n\nHowever, yesterday I noticed a few new deep looking cuts on her. I was really shocked to be honest. I asked her about them and she tried to lie that it was from an accident, even though I didn't buy it at all. She finally admitted about it after I persisted that I don't believe her. I told her I want to talk about this, what caused it, how can I help, but she doesn't want to talk about it and I really don't know what could have made her relapse, nothing seems out of ordinary.\n\nI'm really taken aback by this, I really don't know how to deal with this situation. I want to support her, but she's not open to me and I feel like I've lost some trust right now due to the lies. I'm scared that she'll do it again, I'm scared about the possibility of her committing suicide, and I feel helpless about it.\n\nPlease, could I get some advice on this matter?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "hello! congratulations on being clean for over a month! &lt;3👏🏽\n\nI’ve dealt with constantly feeling abandoned and feeling like “the floater friend”, always in somebody else’s story , somebody else’s friend group, or just in the background, but never having a truly solid circle of my own. There’s many reasons people might experience that. \n\nHave you ever thought that you might be a people pleaser? Have you looked up attachment theory to find your attachment style? (Mine is anxious-preoccupied) But basically what I’ve learned is the fear of rejection and abandonment fuels itself in our lives. \n\nAs a couple silly examples, if im afraid to discuss a strong opinion about something, or add on to an edgy joke someone tells because i feel it might be risky or dark, I’ll  never know whether that person resonates with me on that level or not. So effectively, i miss out on an opportunity to display my genuine personality out of fear of someone else not accepting me. Over time all this does is make you seem a little less robust, a little less memorable. People could view you as having less of a personality. There is less opportunity for real connection because you may be withholding your authenticity due to a fear of not being liked or accepted by who you’re with. \n\nAnd let’s say the other person really doesn’t agree with you or maybe ends up not liking you. 🤷🏽‍♀️ You’ll get rid of someone that doesn’t align with you, but at the same time, being genuine will also attract the people that do align with you. However, you can’t attract the right people or weed the wrong people out by making yourself smaller or restricting yourself in a shell of fear. \n\nBeing authentic and unafraid of abandonment will actually result in you being abandoned less. Even being comfortable with the thought that someone might leave you for being your authentic self, will also attract more people to you. And this will be because of your apparent confidence; but that’s a whole other story. \n\nOf course these might not apply to you, but I related to one of the things you said, so I thought I might give it a shot! 🤗 also you’re still young and young people go through changes constantly. You’re always evolving and learning more of who you are. I’m not friends with anyone I went to school with but the people that I’ve been closest with, I have always met at work, as an adult!

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "You likely would be about to start with your general doctor. They may be comfortable prescribing a \"first-line\" antidepressant, and if it doesn't work (or if they don't feel like they understand anti-depressants well enough) they will refer you to a psychiatrist. Tell them that you are feeling depressed, they will likely ask what specifically makes you think that, you probably won't have to specify that you self-harm and can probably talk about having low energy, morbid/intrusive thoughts, etc. (be specific to yourself!) as well as how long you've been feeling them, and if you have any other mood symptoms like anxiety or mania. There's a chance they will want to test for a possible biological cause before putting you on antidepressants, but if it's been over a year feeling this way and you have no other symptoms, they will likely agree that antidepressants are the way to go.\n\n\nAt 17 (at least in the US) I believe you will be able to go to those appointments alone. At that age I still relied on my parents a lot, especially for anything to do with insurance. If this is also true for you, you can be up-front with any receptionist about it being (one of) your first appointment(s) without your parents, and they will likely be able to point you in the right direction. You might need to call the insurance company to make sure the psychiatrist is covered, but usually in the call to schedule with the psych, they will ask about your insurance and let you know if you need to take additional steps. In theory, your parents will likely be able to see that you went to the psychiatrist and picked up a medication by looking at the summary of how they have used insurance, but most people don't really look at that. I don't think it will specify what medications were picked up, but it will specify the doctor and type of appointment. A psychiatrist will probably want to start with a rigorous assessment and is likely to ask to talk with your parents to understand what symptoms have been around since childhood.\n\n\nIt is technically best if your parents know at least that you are taking meds. Even if they don't know what it's for. You will need to take them at the same time every day, so impromptu sleepovers and travel might have to be declined sometimes. It's increasingly common for people to be on antidepressants even without a history of self-harm, so disclosing that you are on them isn't necessarily an admission that you have been self-harming under their supervision.\n\n\nMost importantly, the first few weeks of an antidepressant can temporarily increase suicidal thought and action. It's very important that you have someone close who knows that you are going through this and that they should check in with you. It's ideal if this is a parent or perhaps a mature sibling (i.e. someone who lives with you) but a friend who lives nearby can also help.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767999939.0, "id": "nyornb6", "author": "calico-collective"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "A true friend will become a closer friend.  However, you do also run the risk of pushing a friend away.  Some people genuinely have no idea what to do or say and will basically avoid you without realizing (or consciously)  until you two just drift apart.  \n\nMy three best friends, honestly they were my absolute best \"help you cover up a murder\" best friends, all reacted differently to finding out I was suicidal.   One became closer, genuinely upset that he didn't notice beyond the small signs, but our friendship has since grown stronger.   One visited me in the hospital once or twice, then drifted away but still acts friendly when I see them in public but doesn't really reach out anymore.   The one that hurt the most though, was a friend I've had since my high school days (I'm mid-40's now).  Best friends through college years and the \"I'm broke take any job I can get\" 20's..   he was the friend I called the night I finally broke.  He stayed on the\nPhone with me and came over, took my g*n away, and sat with me almost the entire night during my first crisis.  He got me through it and I checked myself into the hospital the next day.  When I got out, I reached out to him - he responded by sending me a text:  \"I'm glad you are ok.   Never reach out or talk to me again, lose my number\".\n\nI'll probably never know what specifically it was, but I lost a lifelong best friendship over my pain.   \n\nTLDR; Really ask yourself what you have to gain or lose by telling a friend the truth.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "I think an idea that many people seem to have is that the more/worse scars equals the amount of depression you have. Lots of people think having more will make you have more depression than others or that having that more or severe will show everyone else how bad your depression is. I’ve seen many scars from many different people and even when someone has the most jarring horrid scars they still believe they’re not valid and it’s not enough. The truth is many people mental health is bad and a lot of people have severe depression, people with no scars may also feel the same exact way. You don’t need scars to be depressed, and you can’t measure depression with scars. I mean sure you can measure it that way but if you do you’ll never be satisfied and will keep harming yourself. \n\nCutting yourself is like keeping tangible evidence of your depression, I think it also makes it harder to be happier later on, or when you’re able to take care of yourself. Whenever I feel like I’m able to take care of myself I think that and questioned why I’ve hurt myself and how could I do that to myself and sends me into a spiral. I’m suppose to be loving and keeping safe the child inside me yet I’m cutting him with razor blades.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "I know this is long but let me add a perspective as someone (I’m 26) absolutely coated arms and legs and unavoidably receives preconceived notions when meeting new people for well over a decade now:\n\n• Wound are wounds, your emotions are yours and they’re valid. Depth really means nothing except longer term scars or permanent scars, nerve damage, and your personal story. You are also more likely to experience tattoo blowout if you ever chose to cover up and don’t find the right artist (I have blowout from a cheap tattoo). It has nothing to do with others unless that’s the goal. But those people create a harmful sigma around SH and those who harm in privacy. \n\n• What exactly would you be posing for? Acceptance from the self harm “community”? External validation of pain? Showing off? I used to have a very close friend I found out only befriended me because my scars were visible and hers faded. By having me around it essentially validated her internally and socially that she’s experienced pain and hardship rather than coming to terms and accepting her own journey. \n\n• Please don’t call yourself fragile for experiencing human emotions, pain and vulnerability. And I mean that with love. You did what you needed to do to cope and survive in that moment with the options you had available. If anything, you’re a highly sensitive person (HSP) which is not a bad thing. You just feel the human condition deeper than others and that gives you a greater skill of empathy and compassion than most.\n\n• I’ve been clean for years but still deeply struggle with the ideation. It’s the most addictive substance I’ve ever touched. I think about it almost everyday. The more you get into it the more addictive it becomes. The physical pain takes away from the emotional and releases a wave of endorphins and adrenaline. Much like a dopamine high, it’s only temporary immediate gratification and requires more and more to be satisfied. Endorphins are essential to reduce stress, alleviate pain, it’s considered the “feel good hormone” you can get endorphins from a number of other sources, whether or not positive/beneficial. That’s a reason why there’s depressed people unhealthily addicted to exercise. \n\n• When I last relapsed it was the worst I’ve ever done. It was only a couple cuts but it’s long and deep. It’s not a cut it was a literal gash. I sorta blacked out in the moment and instantly knew I needed stitches this time. Even then, there is an entire chunk of my body I can no longer feel and I panic if I’m dating someone who touches my leg. Even though I’m already covered, it was noticeable I relapsed given the color. It’s fading slower than the rest. But I wasn’t ashamed that time nor did I hide once the scab fully scarred. It’s an addiction and I was proud I managed to make it that many years clean without any support. \n\n• I grew up in a place it was “common” there’s a bunch of people from my hometown who are covered and get it. The comments I got made me feel seen for me from people who understood the survival and didn’t judge or experienced the same. Regardless of background, we all knew at least one person who had a shit life. I now live in a place (privileged and significantly less diverse) where I’ve never, not once, encountered anyone who looks like me. I’ve heard negative, harmful, attention seeking, prejudice comments, judgments and assumptions of who I am as a person, the whole 9. Their only experience of SH is attention/validation seekers. I think theres only been maybe a handful of people who made a comment that truly saw me for me.\n\n• Whatever you choose to do, there will come a day you need to make a choice, will you cover up forever? Or will you accept your past and ignore the judgements of others? I once was told I would never be loved because of the damage I inflicted upon myself. I knew that is untrue but was very young when told that. I don’t show my scars for the benefit of others. I just don’t care anymore. Nor am I uncomfortable looking at my skin anymore (unless realllyyy intoxicated then it’s triggering sometimes). It’s apart of me similar to a tattoo. I want to wear clothes that make me feel good. Fashion is a form of expression. I’ve accepted the shitty life I was dealt and have come to terms with my past actions and mistakes. I’ve grown as a person, learned alternative coping skills, but it shaped me into who I am today. I certainly don’t like the damage I’ve done but I’m not gonna hide my truth for the sake of others. I’m not using my body to cater the discomfort of others nor am I using it as social gain or validation. If anyone judges you, they are not the people you want in your life. They lack the depth to comprehend difficult lives and adversity. You need people who understand, love you, and want the best for you regardless of circumstances. \n\nAgain ask yourself, who would you be posing for? If you feel you’re fake for the shallowness, then my advice is to practice self validation of your own *valid* human emotions with the removal of all external. Understand the harmful stereotypes and rejection that posers and attention seekers project onto people like me and many others.\n\nDM anytime if you need someone to talk to", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767911419.0, "id": "nyhjaja", "author": "dotdotdot_007"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "So how come they let you have scissors again after the first time they found out you were selfharming?\n\nLogic would dictate that things got good enough after they removed the scissors that you were able to have them again, and now you're worried about them being taken away again - because when you had scissors you relapsed.\n\nI am not trying to put pressure on you. Just know that quitting isn't always comfortable and sometimes involves some steps backwards (that's expected, don't sweat it, keep feeling accomplished about the days you successfully didn't engage in the addiction!), and some frustrating periods of being restricted from doing what you want or what feels necessary or right. But it's so much better to go through that now a few times, than to regret not doing so a few years later, \\*and then still have to go through all of that anyway\\*, \\*and for much longer because then you've reinforced the addiction much more.\\*\n\nEven if I'm wrong with the time-line between your parents's restriction and your improvement and relapse, the point remains: Keeping your self-harm a secret won't help the improvement process. Your parents will find out eventually, you'll likely have to face the same consequences then that you're delaying now, and in return you'll only have delayed confrontation with things that make you unhappy, and delayed your ability to shape the future you want.\n\nYou're very likely telling yourself you can't stop under pressure because you're not fully ready to quit yet, becasue it's uncomfortable and you're worried about not having a response to your frustrations when you don't have access to scissors. But there are much better ways to survive difficult times than cutting your skin open. They don't all have to be virtuous. Go eat too much fast food. Spend an evening binge-watching series. Play games, flirt with people, make yourself feel good, it's completely fine to engage in an escape for a day or two as long as you remember that the unhealthy coping mechanism isn't doing anything to alleviate the problem, it just distracts you from it to survive for a little bit, until you're in a slightly better shape to survive on your own and take tiny steps to work on the problem again.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768020269.0, "id": "nyqfnpa", "author": "Laetitian"}

Mental support, reassurance, good replacement activities for the unhealthy coping mechanisms, better temporary coping mechanisms. These are all necessary. That said, the most fundamental change comes from regularly self-reflecting by yourself and with other people to talk about your emotions, your needs, what needs your emotions are expressing, what needs your actions are attempting to fulfil. And then making plans, announcing them publicly, trying to stick to them, and above all else, publicly admitting when your plans have failed, and coming up with the next plan to improve on the previous one, instead of trying to quietly distract from the issue and hope it goes away on its own, so you don't have to confront your difficulties, failures, shame, and discomfort. But you'll feel so much better once you start strengthening your confidence in your ability to shape the future you want by reminding yourself that doing something will always beat doing nothing, so with a little bit of patience and a little bit of doing something, life is guaranteed to become what you want it to be.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768023561.0, "id": "nyqnheu", "author": "Laetitian"}

PLEASE DROP THIS, I have lasting fears and delusions, and it worsened my OCD, I am now CONSTANTLY checking if my partner hates me (he has only EVER been extremely supportive of me, and even thought the ai was \"right\" to point out his \"wrongdoings\" when in reality, it was just saying \"YES BE SCARED\" to every question I asked it.

The AI literally forced me to rewrite the truth, which is extremely damaging, and police pointed out that it majorly complicated legal action against him, and I am now unable to use certain evidence against him, because I discredited it in the sent letter, which could and would be, used against me. Basically AI is actually fucking evil, and unable to ever change from that, because it is unable to form a meaningful conscience.

AI is NOT a legitimate source for help, there are NO legal protections unlike for legal therapy patients. Anything said to an AI can be used against you in court. Describing a scenario where you were spanked as a child for example, constitutes as child sexual abuse material, is removed from chat, and reported against you as the user of the AI.

I'm 23 now and nothing has changed. I don't want to explain the whole story cause that'll be boring but basically since I was 18 I've been living with my aunt. The house we live is is not hers, is my parents, but they live somewhere else. I came here to study and to slowly move out of home without \"failing in living on my own\". Living with my aunt has been very difficult, she has different standards of living and housekeeping as I have and doesn't matter what I do in the house it's never enough, she always has something to call me out on. Her comments are rather hurtful than helpful. Coliving together is insufferable for both her and I. Her personality is very irritating, whenever I am getting called out I look at her listening, I always say please, thank you, I'm sorry, and always listen to what she has to say. Many times she makes me snap because of her tone and choosing of words and not allowing me to respond. This is very out of character of me, I never get angry, I never snap at people, she's the only person who brings me to this point. She never wants to listen when I have to call her out on something that I didn't like, starts insulting me that what I'm asking for is dumb and when I start of nice she keeps ignoring me and laughing at me, making me scalate in anger and then calls me crazy when I finally snap of not being able to make her listen or respond to what I need to say. When I communicate with her I always address the action and why I didn't like it, on the other hand when she communicates with me she straight up jumps into putting me names and instead of talking about the action that bothered her starts talking about me.\nMy parents are emotionally supportive but not physically present in this situation. Whenever we have phonecalls they are like \"oh yeah, you know how she is, she's been like this way before you were even born, she's crazy, we need to kick her out\" and then nothing happens, then she does silent treatment to me, making it super weird and uncomfortable to be in the house and then again another dispute happens, and then again my parents call me to support me and then again nothing happens and so on. It's been 5 years of living like this with this person, not being able to enjoy a house that my parents told me was for me to enjoy. It's coming to a point that I lost faith that something will happen, I think this lady is going to be in here as long as she wants. \nFOR CONTEXT: this woman doesn't pay rent to my parents, she's been here for more than 15 years. I'm an only child, everyone is hyper vigilant on me.\nI really want to get out of here, I told my mom that I'm looking at rooms to rent and she doesn't allow me to do that because she gets upset that I'll be wasting my salary on renting a room. I'm not even allowed to have my medical analysis privately for my own, my family has access to them. I've done many normal things that people my age do without their family watching them and by doing them I felt extreme anxiety and guilt for thinking of getting caught or keeping things like what groceries I buy as a secret.\nI need advice, all of this made me relapse into self harm. I've told them this situation is making me not want to live and they think I'm just being emotional and melodramatic, specially my aunt.\nAny tips of how can I get out of here?

And I used to be numb to these things, didn’t care, infact, I used to hope for them. Now I’m nauseous about death and suicide in particular too.\n\nI had a convo with my partner and I realised how much it affected him. I think that’s it. Someone that really matters to me, probably the only person that gets even halfway through my trust barrier, really nailed it through my head that I was worrying them and suddenly suicide is not desirable, the risk of bleeding out terrifies me, I get sick and want to cry.

I wanna get better and see the world get better too. \n\nAt the same time.. while this could be positive to some, cutting is kinda one of my main coping mechanisms and I’d say I’m good at being safe.

My sister got yelled , slapped and thrown things at , lately she'd been having negative thoughts (feeling alone , isolated) ive been trying to support her , but my school schedule is too long (7am - 7pm) that i dont even have time to eat together with my family. I recently found out that they had a big fight and made my sister stay in her room all alone , i went after her (we share the same room) and tried to talk to her, im not that type to act all lovey dovey , i prefer showing my love through actions and playful teasing , infact , i dont like saying \"i love you\". \n\nMy sister told me how she feels alone and alienated , and told me how shes been having sad thoughts. I wanna help her but how? Im not too close with her , we always fight , but still , i love her to the bottom of my heart\n\nI still dont know what to do , but i ordered from an online shop.

I’ve been wanting to post this for weeks. It’s been inside my chest for so long. I just hope there’s people who actually cares to understand why I did this. I wish I was understood.\n\nSo anyways I play badminton once a week with friends. I also work out the day before badminton and swim as well during weekend. \n\nHowever I have not been able doing any work outs and swimming for the past few weeks due to schedule changes, holidays and I was sick as well. \n\nWhen I do correctly, I can defense and bend down better to pick up shuttle better. However that wasn’t the case as I only play badminton for the past few weeks. Even if I do works outs and swim, I still lost against my friends. The reason is because they had been playing and training since they were young. I didn’t. I only play a few years ago.  When I win it because they went easy on me. I really suck. \n\nI want to punish myself so bad, and the thought just keeps lingering in my head. My mind is really turbulent I wish I can make it stop. In fact just now when I play with them, I notice I keep making mistakes on my footwork I got so pissed at myself I used my racquet at a rattan stick to cane myself on thighs so that I stop doing mistakes. Believe it or not, it did work, and my footwork did improve for a bit, although there’s still much needed to be done. At this point the only thing that can constantly remind myself is the pain I inflict on myself whenever I did mistakes. That’s the least worst of it. I even think that I do not deserve to keep my legs and should become wheel chair bound for the rest of my life. Because I don’t know how to use them. The only thing that can force me to keep up with my friends is with pain. I know it’s messed up. I feel like even people on wheelchair can play better than me. \n\nI know what are my problems are, besides mentally. I’m not going to get any therapist. I did that before and attended 20 times. It didn’t help. Never again. I ain’t spending any more money on counselling sessions. They may make you feel better,  it they do nothing.

I just went through a breakup that completely blindsided me, and the amount of pain feels unbearable.

The person I loved and supported walked away from me so quickly, and now i’m stuck replaying every little moment in my head, questioning myself, and feeling like i was never enough. It hurts especially when I see her act all normal in our group chat with friends while i’m falling apart. It makes me feel like i’m invisible.\n\nPart of what’s making this so painful for me is that the breakup happened over a misunderstanding of a friend that I made in college. we usually just hang out, eat food, vent about life, and occasionally hang out with her roommate. There has been nothing romantic going on between us, she openly talked about other people she’s interested in, but my ex didn’t believe me. I’ve tried to stay open and honest about the whole thing but I guess it was just never enough. I feel like I lost the relationship over something that wasn’t true, and being blamed for this just hurts me even more.\n\nI’ve been too overwhelmed with urges to hurt myself right now. Not because I want to die, but because I don’t know how else to release this pain.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "Ok, my take on this:\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like one of the very many people that don't understand what self-harm is, and assume people just do it for a fruck of it.\n\nHim threatening to ignore you for multiple days on end if you *use your coping mechanism*, something that is a strategy used to manage stress, is an absolute a-hole move.\n\nEven if self-harm isn't the absolute best mechanism for you physically, it's still a coping mechanism. Him punishing you for coping is not going to motivate you, it's going to make you feel even shittier, which in turn, will make you want to cope. Then it will create a cycle. What he's doing is going to unintentionally have the EXACT opposite effect of what he's trying to make.\n\nWhich is precisely why and what you need to tell him. Not necessarily with that bluntness, but that general idea. Help reduce his ignorance, basically. I'm sorry that he's acting like this, those \"rules\" are pure stupid, and you don't deserve that.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767747785.0, "id": "ny45uer", "author": "AbsoluteL0ser727"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "Healing will take a while. A couple weeks until the wound stops reopening and then up to year (if not more, depending on depth, care and body) until it's not red anymore. However, without stitches or butterfly bandages, the scar will be pretty wide and won't faint. It'll get brighter, sure, but always very noticeable. Also, please take good care of yourself, these wounds in particular are prone to infection. Stay safe!", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767747932.0, "id": "ny46avc", "author": "mycactiareonfire"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfharm", "text": "I usually use band aids and they take a while to heal (I recommend using more wound care than me). Scabbing usually takes over a week depending on depth. The scars will turn dark after a few months and won't fully heal until a year or two.
