She has been the one who came to me, she was already friends with my mum and sister for a few years before adding me in 2024. She had drove past me a couple of times while I was walking, and she had tried to flirt with me a few times (which me being how I am, not knowing the cues for flirting or anything of the sorts), but when I had posted a video on my story on Facebook, she messaged me when she had seen that. Ever since then, we had been talking to each and been seeing each other nearly every single day, even when the kids were home from school or kinder, with only a handful of times having a bit of fun in the bedroom when the kids weren't around.\n\nThis past week though, I had started to feel as though I like her more than just someone to have some fun with. We had both agreed to be on the same page and just have it as a mutual thing and see how things go after a couple of months. Also in this past week, there is something that had came up for her, which is upsetting when we had agreed to not spend time on Monday, due to us possibly feeling overwhelmed in the future. On Tuesday, we did hangout had planned the week prior, but to what the news she had received on Monday, it didn't turn out as planned, but we still had a good day though (somewhat good day anyway).\n\nNow, as of yesterday and today, we hadn't spent any time together as it's been to hot to really do anything due to being summer (the heat had finally reached mid-high 30 Celsius here in Melbourne Australia), but I have been here left to my feeling and thoughts, I realised that I feel as though I am heartbroken and hurting.The last time I had felt this way was about 10 years ago when I had thought I was close with someone, who I started to feel highly affectionate towards, but that was because I knew the red flags, but ignored them until it was to late.\n\nI'm honestly not even sure if It's actually heartbreak, betrayal or what that I am feeling, but it does feel like as though I have been heartbroken, betrayed and somewhat being lied to, while completely terrified and it also doesn't help that I do suffer from depression also (which I have managed for the most part).\n\nI am just wondering if it's normal to think that I had moved on from past bad experiences, only to find that I never truly healed what I had thought was meaningful relationships? Or, if it could also be some form of trauma that I may need to seek some help for?\n\nP.S. She had only been looking to date again for about year, had a few dates before we had started hanging out. I wasn't going out looking to date or looking for any form of relationship as I ended up going with the flow, as in if someone comes across and we both start spending time together and have a connection of any sort, I would explore to see where it goes and maybe get a long term bond with them.\n\nP.P.S I'm not looking for advise or be told to go seek help, I'm just wanting to know if it's normal to be in this similar situation.\n\nP.P.P.S The last few woman I was close to and wanted to be close to all had me heartbroken and hurt.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "(Part 1 of 2. Character limit)\n\nVery interesting! ✌😊\n\nI'll respond here instead of on the original post. It says none of it is a complaint and that you don't wanna change, so I interpret that as meaning I shouldn't go in there and be like \"That sounds fine. It's different but I think you'll be okay.\" since it's the way we talk to troubled people.\n\nBut since this is MMFB I think I'm inbounds 🥰🤙\n\nI relate in a VERY abstract way.\n\nI myself am very drastically neurodivergent (in very different ways from you) and just, the way everything functions when it all comes together is kinda eerily convenient. I'm not gonna talk your ear off about me tho! 😅\n\n#I think you're a pretty optimized person overall. All things considered, I don't foresee any serious problems on your horizon that'll stem from anything you've said.\n\nOf course *anyone* can end up in a lot of trouble from environmental factors, and *anyone* can feel compelled to walk a dark path in life if they're hurt badly enough.\n\nI agree with you that it's a lot of abnormalities, but I don't see anything that shouts \"This person is gonna cause problems for the world\" or \"This person is especially vulnerable.\" That's what's most important imo. Safety.\n\n##Asexuality and sexual repulsion\n\nI don't foresee this holding you back in the modern world. \n\nIf we were still working with a global population of less than ten thousand and we were in a village of 30 people, I might be less understanding. \n\nThat's just because reproduction used to be more important. That's why to many people, it still *feels* important. Matters of sex/dating used to be a matter of life/death for the collective. Our lifespan used to be 30 years.\n\nBut yeah, 8 billion people is enough! ✌😅 What we need to work on now is taking better care of the ones we have. \n\nPlease never let yourself feel even a little bit bad about not wanting to have kids. Though if you can be nice to the ones you see around, that'd be great! 🥰👍\n\nIt's good that you've still occasionally had romantic feelings. If you ever start to really crave romance without any sexuality, that's easier to manage than it used to be.\n\nYou can either seek another asexual, or someone who's just sexual in a way that doesn't involve their partner, which is something many won't do. You'd be a godsend to someone like that.\n\n##Your food/alcohol sitch looks fine. Might even be perfect.\n\nIf you're not selective about how things taste, you can just choose whatever's healthy/affordable. That's gonna be good for your physical and mental health, and budget. You're dodging a lot of bullets by being like this.\n\nMy only concern is the lack of gratification. It's important for you to have enough things in your life that are satisfying, so you can be happy. But there's a lot of other ways to do that. You've said you have a lot of interests.\n\nOfc alcohol is an excusable vice, life is hard, but I'd never nudge anyone toward it. If you don't partake yourself, but you're not completely averse to being around those who do, you'll be highly valued by peers.\n\nIf you're willing to be the designated driver, people will repay that with other favors. Like ofc they'll pay for gas, and they'll probably buy you food and stuff. I've done this a lot. I'm frequently the only non-drinker at an event. It's still fun!\n\n##Health and body-related things\n\nSocial awkwardness without social anxiety is to be expected, I think. Social situations can be awkward for everyone. It'll get better with time. If there's no anxiety, you're probably not working with anything significantly disruptive. You're just learning. That's normal! ✌😊\n\nI don't foresee any problems with the bodily function thing. As long as you're not being rough on anyone else for not being the same, yeah! I can't imagine anyone being like \"Why do you always burp so quietly? That's really annoying 🤨\" 🤭", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767506017.0, "id": "nxkvxh4", "author": "Misaka__Misaka"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "(Part 2 of 2. Character limit)\n\n##Your sleep situation is perfect. That's how it's supposed to be, really.\n\nI've never met anyone who sleeps that successfully. By our design, that SHOULD be the norm, but our bodies haven't evolved in awhile and a lot of societal/technological changes are working against us.\n\nLike our bodies were not designed to be living around all these electromagnetic fields, and artificial lighting is something our brains don't even really understand in a sense. \n\nThey're still calibrated for a world where the sun and fire were the only light. When we see light, we subconsciously think daytime, so all this electronic interference takes a toll. We're designed to sleep in pitch black darkness. Nothing more than moonlight. \n\nExperiments have been done on circadian rhythm stuff, and humans consistently stay diurnal even if they don't have access to the sun or knowledge of the time of day. \n\nYou're somehow sleeping the way we were MEANT to sleep. I wouldn't expect that from anyone who's not Amish. Abstaining from stimulants is a big help, but you've got your electronics and they're not messing with you. That's fascinating.\n\nFavoring structure and planning over spontaneity will only become an issue if you try to impose it on others, like being controlling. You seem to have a very thorough understanding that we're all different and that it's okay, so I don't think you would.\n\n##Personality\n\nNot many people will complain about you being quiet in a group. Most people like talking more than listening. Unless EVERYONE is being quiet, I don't expect it'll be noticed a lot, and if it's noticed in that context, they're doing it too! 😁🤙\n\nIf you're comfortable with silence, that's a good thing to establish with new friends. If they're used to feeling compelled to keeping conversations active and flowing, they may perceive a lack of input as an effort imbalance because they feel like they need to talk extra.\n\nBut if you assure them you're comfortable and not expecting them to like, entertain you - THAT takes the pressure off. They'll appreciate it! ✌😊\n\nThe deep intellectual conversation thing resonates strongly with me! I get along very well with people like that. I think it's tragic how many people can't really get into anything deep.\n\nIt's very annoying to have someone prod me for answers on a topic and I'll warn them \"Maybe later, but it's deep and I gotta get a better idea of your personality before I talk about anything like that\" and they'll bring it up 2 more times, so I'll try, and after less than 5 minutes they're like \"What is this? A podcast???\" .\n\nI'm just like \"Nevermind m8. Forget it.\"\n\nThat's because I'm too polite to leave it untranslated 🤭 Translation -\n\n&gt;!🙄 I SAID it's __DEEP!__ *THIS* is what I was tryna *avoid*, you &amp;%#@in' @&amp;#%-#&amp;@%in' mutha-&amp;@%#! 🤬 Ugh just go play outside! Shoo! 🤭!&lt;\n\nThat tendency will be appreciated by the people you're glad you met though. It'll feel like a drug to meet someone who enjoys dissecting all the stuff everyone else thinks is so simple and putting it under a microscope. \n\nLike, I do a lot of remote voice chats, often in groups, and we'll talk about fictional stuff in very great detail, all the lessons and stuffs. We recently talked about Ninja Turtles for like half an hour. Only came up because of a video game we were playing, and we only had 3 people, but still! xD\n\nI hope this is the right decision I'm about to make. I intend to address your other stuff later, but I always say a lot on everything and a lot of my drafts that I work on intermittently end up not being used because of deleted posts.\n\nIt's already been two days, so I'm afraid you'll delete it, and I'm tired.

That's okay! I filter a lot! 😊🤙\n\nSo would you be willing to describe in your own words what you mean by your empathy being more cognitive than emotional? In greater detail than that, I mean. That's probably enough for me to understand, but I value clarity greatly.\n\nAlternatively I could reveal what I'm thinking. Different people would prefer different approaches. Some don't like to talk about this because they're accustomed to harsh judgment (they don't expect me to be different. I am) and they're relieved by me saying it first. It loosens them up and they get more comfortable.\n\nOthers don't have any issue with talking about it, and would be more put off by what they perceive as a kinda presumptuous analysis.\n\nYour comfort with public speaking makes me think this route would be more suitable for you.

When we first started dating it her mom didn't let us talk to each other for a whole week after finding out about me because her mom checks her phone and until things got cleared up we didn't get to talk to each other (tho we did it through discord since her mom didn't know about discord yet), and in the middle of that her step-dad called me \"to see who I actually am\" cause they thought I was some 20 year old guy.\n\nAnyways up until now we were talking over text and spending basically all of our free time together, and in between this been video calling and talking to each other because it's the only thing that makes us feel close because of the distance, up until winter break we didn't have much time to spend together, and I thought calling was a very normal thing to do. But, her mom does not like the idea of us video calling or calling at all in general which caused her to hide her phone a lot.\n\nNow what happened is yesterday as of posting this or (dec 30th) we were on video call since she came back from her sport club which was around 10 am for me, and since I have been experiencing sleep problems because of family drama I was dealing with, my girlfriend is basically my escape, because I can talk to her about it and she comforts me (same goes for her), like I was saying because of this and her waking up early to go to her practice for her sport she was also tired so we decided to take a nap. Now, stupid me didn't think that anything would have happened if both of us fell asleep especially her during the day and, well nothing happened right away when I woke up after a 1 hour nap and had to go eat and AGAIN I tried waking her up by calling her name but she wouldn't wake up and I had to go eat so, I left my phone on the bed and right as I left and didn't end the call her mom walked in caught her in a call with me, ended the call and now my nightmare begins.\n\nSo right after this happens I get a text from my girlfriends number from her mom telling me how disappointed she was that we couldn't follow her rules. And I try to talk to her about what's going to happen and she responds with \"you will not be hearing from her again\" and after that I sent many text and got left on read. Anyways my girlfriend decides to text me through a mutual discord server through her computer so her mom wouldn't find out which she eventually did like about 2 hours ago and said that she will not let us contact each other until she is 18 and, because she is 7 months younger than me it will be 23 months until then, and now I am left here sobbing all night wishing I had made better choices, I know I can't change what's done but what do I do from here on out, I can't contact anyone in her family since her step-dad that had called me changed his number, and trying to talk with the mom will just end up with me being ghosted, I talked to a mutual friend that's actually who I met her through, and he told me to stay positive and have hope that she'll find a way to contact me, and I'm sitting here hoping and wishing that everything would go back to normal.\n\nI don't want to think letting her go as an option, I really love her, but, do I just wait out the next two year or do I just move on, I am very hurt rn and feel like crying every second but, can't cause I just need to think positive.\n\nIf there's any updates in the next couple of days or weeks I'll make sure to keep people updated.\n\n*Update*\n\nOkay this is less of an update of what's currently happening and more of an update on what I previously forgot to say,\n\nSo, you might already know that her step-dad had called me to see if I'm a creep or an old guy, or am I the actual person that I say I am. Now her mom like I said before did know we were dating for the last 5 months, once even asking her how we were doing, now the part I left out was that the main reason she says she's \"disappointed\" is because me and my girlfriend sometimes dirty talked over our messages, we usually stayed quiet or whispered when talking over call, mainly just looking at each other there and then when doing something eating, playing games, watching a movie, etc. the text I got from her mother in discord after she found out she was contacting me through her computer, was that she was mad about the way we talked and that it was \"inappropriate\" the way we talked towards each other, and that I would have a zero percent chance of contacting her before she's 18. She did say it was a \"joint decision\" between the mom and the step-dad which I do not believe, Because before that message when I was talking to my girlfriend I asked her the question of her step-dad knew and which is she said he's on her side but decided to stay neutral (I really don't know who to believe but that's what I was told).\n\nNow with asking permission before hand to video call, she did that on multiple occasions which she said her mom said that \"I need to talk to your step-dad about it\", which I don't know if she ever did or not.\n\nAnd I don't know if I'm an asshole for saying this but her mom has 0 empathy for our relationship because on her phone for one of the 3 messages she sent on my girlfriends phone was that \"I understand this is disappointing and SEEMS hurtful. This is about my daughter and her consequences\" which I replied with it doesn't seem hurtful it is hurtful. In which she has not replied since besides the last message on discord.\n\nI really don't know what to do and would appreciate some advice on how to cope with this, my heart is heavy and I have little to no motivation in doing anything, because everything I do ends up with me thinking about her,  like I said before I don't want to end this relationship we both really love each other, and I have to stay hopeful somehow she'll contact me soon.\n\nBut, I'd like to ask if there is a way to deal with the way of really missing her and wanting to talk to her, if I can temporarily try to cope and stay hopeful then the constant feeling of my heart hurting like it has never before.

There were good times, I guess, but there were also so many times I was genuinely scared of him. Times when I felt completely powerless and alone. Things would be fine and then something horrible would happen, and afterwards he’d act like nothing ever happened. I started questioning if I was remembering things right, if I was losing my mind.\n\nI’ve been avoiding saying this, but I think the relationship was abusive. And now I’m in this awful place where I feel torn apart inside. I don’t want to destroy his life - he has nothing. No money, nowhere stable to live, serious mental health problems. But what he did to me was horrible. I can’t just pretend it didn’t happen.\n\nHis family either ignores what he does or makes excuses for him. When I try to talk about it, they make me feel like I’m crazy - not just him, but them too. It makes me doubt everything.\n\nHere’s what I know happened:\n\nOne time I was crying and he slapped me across the face. The more I cried, the angrier he got.\n\nHe pushed me into a towel rack and dented it because I accidentally tossed his pants and they hit his face.\n\nHe tried to force me to drink shroom tea. When I said no, he kept shoving it at me until it spilled everywhere, then he slapped me and called me a stupid bitch. Said I was the problem.\n\nHe got drunk and stormed into my apartment screaming that I abandoned him. He threw my stuff around, ripped my shirt off me, and held me down. My roommate had to physically kick him out.\n\nThe first time he grabbed my throat, I was half-naked. I had to do a Zoom meeting after with a scratchy voice. When I brought it up later, he said it was sexual and that I was exaggerating.\n\nHe wouldn’t drive me to work unless we had sex first. If I cried or was running late, he’d threaten to just leave me there.\n\nDuring sex, when he got frustrated or couldn’t get hard, he’d pinch me hard, pull my hair, and call me names. He’d accuse me of cheating or being a bitch.\n\nOnce he climbed on top of me and hit me in the head multiple times because I accidentally hit his eye with his pants.\n\nHe drove like a maniac, pulling my hair and saying we were both going to die because I talked about leaving him. I had a complete panic attack.\n\nHe choked me. Multiple times. Not for long, but long enough to scare the hell out of me.\n\nHe wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom during sex. Even when I was crying, he wouldn’t let me stop.\n\nHis cousin heard me crying during a fight and came in to check. He got even more pissed and blamed me for letting someone see me like that.\n\nWhen his brother was staying in the same room, he made me have sex with him in the bathroom. I felt so humiliated but didn’t know how to say no.\n\nHe used to “check” me to see if I’d been with other guys, while he was out there cheating on me.\n\nHe bit my face when he was angry and held me down, poking me in the chest while I cried.\n\nI think early in our relationship he did something sexual to me when I was half-asleep after getting high. It’s fuzzy but it still haunts me.\n\nIf I said something hurt or that I wanted to stop during sex, he’d laugh at me, say I was lying, or just keep going.\n\nHe called me a cheater for wanting to hang out with friends or family. Meanwhile he was the one lying and cheating.\n\nI hate admitting this, but sometimes I just gave in to sex because I was scared of what would happen if I said no. I’d cry during it or after and feel like my body wasn’t mine anymore. Sometimes he wouldn’t let me get dressed or made me stay in positions until he was done with whatever he was doing.\n\nOne time the neighbors heard me crying and him screaming. He was throwing things, yelling threats through the wall, saying he’d kill them. Later he blamed me for the whole thing.\n\nSo why do I still feel so confused about everything?\n\nHe’s been through trauma. He has mental health issues. Part of me still wants him to be okay. But none of that makes what he did okay.\n\nIs this actually abuse? Is it sexual assault if I was crying, saying I didn’t want to keep going, and he wouldn’t let me stop?\n\nI feel like I’m losing my mind trying to understand it all. And I still feel guilty. I can’t make myself report anything - he’s already lost everything. He’s homeless because I left him.

I'll be typing more, but I wanna first be sure everything you're able to do to stop him from having physical access to you has been done. \n\nI know you said he's in jail right now, but no justice system is perfect. Just like people who don't belong locked up get stuck in there, some who really need it get released.\n\nThose systems are complicated, so there's lots of misunderstandings. People can be stuck in or let out on technicalities. \n\n#With that being the case, don't count on them holding him there.\n\nI admire your compassion. \n\nYou wouldn't be doing yourself or anyone else any favors by being hateful. \n\nBut please don't let that get you into extra danger.\n\nIt's okay to want others to feel better so they can live better, but keep yourself safe above all else. \n\nYou need to stay alive and healthy in order for that compassion to be helpful! 🥰\n\nThere's a difference between an excuse and explanation ☝\n\nAn __excuse__ is to say \"This is why it happened, and that's why I'm not wholly responsible for it.\"\n\nAn __explanation__ is to say \"This is why it happened\" and that's it.\n\nNobody's just a natural born irredeemable piece of shit. Everything everyone does has an explanation, but not always an excuse. \n\nAll wrongdoing comes from discomfort. Without that discomfort, it doesn't happen. \n\nIt can all be stopped before it starts if it's fully understood and handled properly.\n\nHealing is the most effective retaliation, because that's what stops further harm.\n\nThe healthiest way for a victim to look at these things is to focus on protecting other victims.\n\nIf more suffering caused victimizers to improve, then yeah I'd say vengeance all the way.\n\nThat used to BE my way too. 😔\n\nThat doesn't work though. \nSuffering is why they get so destructive in the first place.    \n\nI can tell you already understand this, so I know I'm not teaching you anything. \n\nI'm just saying it because I personally like to see my thoughts echoed in other people's words.    \nIt's comforting even though I already know they're valid.\n\nHaving said all that, healing him isn't what you should be focused on. This diagnosis (if it's accurate) will probably be the beginning of a better life for him if the treatment is adequate.\n\nThese are things that need to be handled by the people who do it for a living. The best thing you can do for both of you (and the world) right now is heal ___yourself.___\n\nI recommend getting the ball rolling on that ASAP however you can.   \nDon't be afraid of the stigma on mental health services. \n\n#Therapy is so helpful, it should be in school curriculums. \n\nEspecially if you're anywhere with universal healthcare, you've already paid for it in your taxes.   \nThat's like a sidewalk. It's for everyone.\n\nIf you don't have access to professionals, there's a lot of support groups. Anonymous online settings will keep it from being awkward if you'd rather not do anything local.\n\nYou're in danger of developing destructive behavioral tendencies yourself if you don't get enough care during this vulnerable time. \n\nIt can skew your whole perception of the world and its people if you get the feeling nobody cares as much for you as a victim as you care for a victimizer. \n\nLike kindness, cruelty is a cyclical thing.    \nYour personality is obviously very warm right now, and that's something to be nourished.\n\nDon't ever start to think you should be \"over it\" by now, however far in the future it is. This is something pretty much nobody fully recovers from.\n\nI recommend being heard out, and hearing out other victims. It might feel kinda repetitive, but that really drives the point home how very real this is.\n\nYou'll be meeting people who are still having flashbacks decades after it's over. \n\nYou'll hear about trauma triggers that need to be actively avoided by those who live with them.\n\nYou'll be able to tell that these are strong people, so you'll be sure that feeling things deeply isn't weakness.\n\nThat's what'll do the most to equip you to be patient with yourself. It's gonna be a long road, so the last thing you need is to feel bad *about* feeling bad.\n\nTake it one day at a time.\n\n#May your roads lead to warm sands ✌🐱\n\n#💖🤝🌎", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1766643149.0, "id": "nvu1lew", "author": "Misaka__Misaka"}

A lot of parents kinda lose themselves in parenting and to some extent kinda forget who they were before. \n\nEmpty nest syndrome refers to the feeling of lacking a purpose, but there's more to life than contributing to the collective.\n\nParenting healthy kids is the best contribution most people are able to make, so they tend to lock in pretty tight and focus like lasers.\n\nFor someone who knows how that feels, nothing compares. That's why the depression.\n\n#BUT -☝😊\n\n##Your dad is MUCH more than just a dad.\n\n##Always has been. \n\nHe probably set aside quite a bit of his hobbies/interests and postponed some plans to be a parent. It was probably discouraging at first. \n\nKnowing you and your sibling needed him was where he got most of his gratification for a long time, so that's what he's used to right now.\n\nWith time, he'll remember what else he is.   \nHe'll learn to live more for himself again. He'll be happy.    My brother and my SIL recently reached this stage.     \n\n#They're amazing and unstoppable.\n\nThe best thing you can do for him is thrive, and of course keep in touch. He's inevitably gonna be worried since this is a new phase of your life, so keep him updated.\n\nHe needs to know he really was everything you needed. Remember, he probably cares most about your happiness and safety, so try to focus more on that in your updates.\n\nThe honest news regarding your usual stuff like health, career, dating, other social endeavors is not always gonna be pleasant, so be sure you include whatever positive emotions you can manage even when it's not.\n\nLike if you're having money problems, or if you lose a job or a partner, be sure you spot any silver linings, however thin, and laugh at least once during each call.\n\nYour laughter is what's gonna help him stay assured that you're okay enough that he can stay focused on recovering from empty nest syndrome.\n\n\"Well we're broke as fuck, but at least we can rule out frivolous lawsuits. No lawyer would take the case. I'm also not worried about street crime as much anymore now that I had to sell my jewelry. What are they gonna take???\"\n\n\"My partner left, and I kinda feel like it was mostly my fault, but at least I got more sprawling space on the bed and I won't need to leave parties early. Restaurant meals for one are pretty cheap too.\"\n\n\"The kids got suspended from school for fighting, but as it turned out they were standing up to a bully, so we took their side in front of the teacher and went to McDonald's. They're probably gonna fail the test on Friday with no lectures, but such immaculate badassery outweighs ONE F.\"\n\nThat kinda thing!\n\n#May your roads lead to warm sands ✌🐱\n\n#💖🤝🌎", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1766540388.0, "id": "nvn9sdw", "author": "Misaka__Misaka"}

Father died when I was 4, and my mother got with an abusive asshole afterwards. The cliffnotes version is basically that my childhood was full of physical and emotional abuse and neglect. Love was conditional, and vulnerability was most times met with a fist, insult, being grounded, or having basic needs like food and such withheld from me.\n\nThe holidays were no different. To be honest, the memories of my childhood have pretty much all but vanished. The only core memories I do have are bad ones. I don't really remember the holidays at all, I just know they were often times spent extremely stressed, or being punished for my 'parents' putting any effort into celebrating.\n\nThings like, \"I'm doing this for you, I could be relaxing right now.\" or \"You don't deserve a Christmas.\" or \"I wonder how my life would have been if I never had any of you\", or dismissive \"Happy Birthday\" 's are all I really got during holidays.\n\nIf presents were bought, I was guilted for them putting in the effort. If food was made I was guilted for them doing it. Even showing gratitude was something that wasn't allowed and was met with scorn and punishment.\n\nI learned that gifts are dangerous, everything was conditional; especially love, and the only way to really be 'safe' was to not ask for anything at all, move like a ghost, and expect worse than nothing at all times, especially during the holidays.\n\nNaturally, the holidays are an extremely depressing time for me. I push it off with a 'Ya know, that's just life.\" or a \"What can you do? It happens.\" but in truth, seeing other's have natural, happy holidays with their families guts me badly.\n\nI get so envious to even experience what a microcosm of it would be like. To have parents who put forth effort, not to make you guilty or hold it over you, but because they genuinely care. To receive a gift because someone was thinking of you, remembered your birthday, or again, genuinely cared to put forth the effort.\n\nI don't even know why i'm here, honestly.

Thankies, friend! :3\n\n&gt;You are an angel\n\nI'll never tire of hearing that! 🫶🥰 \n\nYes, perspective is SO helpful, but it's understandable that we struggle to relate to each other so much. Most of the world's people are tragically overworked, so they need pretty much ALL of what little free time they do have just to relax and have fun. Barely enough to keep their heads on straight enough to get through one more day.\n\nWhen people aren't under so much pressure, they get a lot more peaceful and start developing new interests. They also start socializing more. After enough socializing I've found that most of the differences between people's struggles are cosmetic. It's just the differences in how things appear from the outside looking in that make the world so divided.\n\nEveryone's afraid to slow down as an individual, because others will get ahead. But we *do* have the option of slowing down __together. Collectively.__ Like, everything would stay in proportion between people, nobody would be left behind. All that'd change is the overall stress level would drop. I hope to inspire such a slowdown on a global scale, like where we all agree to lower our expectations for health's sake.\n\nLike, what if the work week was only like 15 hours, but you still made the same amount of money? The tradeoff would be everyone else is working less too, so like, you wouldn't be getting packages from the other side of the world delivered overnight. Everything would be less efficient, but that wouldn't be so bothersome if your life was TRULY yours.\n\nPeople who are overworked cope by believing they only want very few things out of life, but once they get enough of those things, their minds open up. They broaden their horizons and develop new interests. If we all had more time to just chill and talk to each other, we'd connect a lot more.\n\nEspecially through doing relatable whiny bitch fits!\n\nAnd UNrelatable whiny bitch fits would be productive too! Like, I've been a super broke bitch my whole life, but I've talked to rich people about their problems, and if I really put myself in their shoes, I get it.\n\n#This is not a realistic example of what I've heard, it's a caricature, but it's fun and interesting!\n\nLike, if they're sitting in the back of a limousine grumbling in frustration, thinking their new limo driver sucks because they keep turning too tightly and hitting curbs, and they're like \"My wine just tipped over and spilled on my lobster!\"\n\n##It's easy for me to say that's petty, but to someone who's always been rich, it wouldn't be. \n\nLike, if they don't know how it feels to walk down a sidewalk to a store while being mindful of their body language, trying not to look too cocky but also not too timid, so none of the unhappy people they walk past will start a fight...\n\nLike, if all they have to compare that to is a lifetime of perfectly smooth limo rides with lobster and wine in the right measure, YES, that sucks! It makes sense to be grumpy!\n\nWe all just need to really hear each other out, and we'll see we're not so different in the ways that really matter. \n\nUnfortunately with the world in its current state, most people just don't have enough time for each other.\n\nThis lack of effort to connect is to be expected.    \nThey don't even have enough time for themselves.\n\n#It seems like nobody cares, but that's an illusion.\n\n#Almost EVERYONE cares.\n\n##They just know they can't afford to do anything to help in most cases, so they're trying not to think about it.\n\nThink about it. Every time you see a stalled out car on the side of the road and just keep driving, are you ever thinking \"Eh. Idk them. Fuck 'em.\"\n\nIf you could just slow down and tap the hood of their car with your hand and have it magically start up just like that, you'd be doing that, right?\n\nNot even fully stop. Not even wait for thanks. Like they might not even get a look at you. Never know who helped them. They certainly couldn't reciprocate. Would it matter?\n\nBut you just know it's gonna be more complicated than that if you stop, and you're probably in the middle of something else. Other people are counting on you.\n\nThere are exceptions, ofc, but this is what most people are like.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "#Sorry to hear about that, friend! 🥰🫂\n\n#Good news first!☝️🙂\n\n##Your odds might not be so bad.\n\nI know statistically STIs are very prevalent, like supposedly more than half the population of my country (the US) has oral herpes, and that's only one STI.\n\nAnd as you were probably taught, because of the way they spread, for all intents and purposes this was effectively the same as you having sex with all her previous partners unprotected too.\n\nSo it seems like your odds of catching something are pretty bad even if you only did it once, I know.\n\nI'm only one person, so I only got one story and it's not a reliable baseline for anything, but whatevs! 🤷\n\nI've had unprotected sex without catching anything, and it was with a girl who said she didn't wanna tell me how many partners she'd had. She was afraid of judgment.\n\nI didn't press the topic because I honestly don't give a h3ck. Never really have. I think it's pretty messed up how harshly people judge each other over sex.\n\nShe was also older than I was, I think she said 32 or 33? So yeah that's a lot more time then that girl you had sex with has had. She wasn't using condoms. Still didn't get anything.\n\n#What about second good news? ✌️🙂\n\nIf you REALLY put in the time and do the research and learn what there is to learn, you'll see STIs are an overblown thing. They're *really* not all that big of a deal.\n\nMost of them don't have any significant health effects. A lot can be cured or treated to such an extent where they're effectively nothing.\n\nI mean, yeah they're ugly, but look at the world around you. People who should be in prison are in positions of power. People are being sold in crates like furniture. \n\nPeople are being assaulted by the people they trust the most and getting lifelong psychological damage that messes up their ability to trust and love.\n\nWars are being fought over shit that shouldn't matter, and people are being condemned for fleeing warzones. \n\nDoes it really make sense to stress over ugly skin at a time like this???\n\nI for one think we should just be grateful to be having sex. Like, LOTS of people who want to don't get to. \n\nYou should really be a lot more afraid of unwanted pregnancy than STIs. Kids only belong with people who want them, and only when they're ready. Also, kids can tell when they're not wanted. They can feel it.\n\nYou potentially getting some ugly skin wouldn't be as big of a deal as having someone grow up feeling like an intruder in their own home, developing mental problems accordingly, and affecting others.\n\n#Only little bit of bad news\n\nSTIs are less likely to be visible in AFABs. Like, if you have anything you'll probably see it since your stuff is all on the outside, but even if she was in the middle of a ginormous flare up of something, the sores could all be on the inside. You'd have touched them but not seen them.\n\n#My advice (I'll be passing over the obvious)\n\nAvoid referring to being STI-free as \"clean\". Try to remember you're dealing with people. \n\nThey're just as important and vulnerable as you are, and the opposite of clean is dirty. \n\nThat's not an okay label to put on a person.    \nThey're not a floor or a table or a kitchen utensil.\n\nThat label cuts very deep.

Let's try to make you feel better!\n\nI didn't see any silver linings in what happened besides the obvious, which is that you've learned how *not* to treat people. I expect you didn't need advice for that!\n\n__What I did see__ is the dates 2023-2024. Does that mean you've successfully gotten away from this person?\n\nI understand that doesn't mean everything is okay. Psychological damage doesn't heal nearly as quickly as physical damage.\n\nI also understand rumors have long-term wide-reaching effects. I know most people just believe whatever they want to. I expect you're still being affected by the rumors, even if nobody says anything directly to you.\n\nI won't marginalize the plight of people who've been affected by rumors. The human need for acceptance is there by design, so barring neurodivergence, ostracism is scary to everyone.\n\n#It does matter how others feel about us, because it determines how we're treated.\n\nTrying to diminish the lasting damage isn't what you need right now. That's real, and it's gonna stay with you. Be patient with yourself. The worst thing you can do is feel bad *about* feeling bad. \n\nLike, try not to think you should be \"over it\" at any point.\n\nFocusing on the positive will help too! If you've gotten away from them, the coercion is at least over.\n\nI'm sure you don't feel good about them being out there when this is how they are, since they'll probably target others.\n\nBut when you can't adjust your circumstances, adjusting your outlook is the next best thing!\n\nIt's bad that they'll probably continue, but the more they do it, the more likely they are to be noticed and stopped.\n\nWhatever rumors they started about you might not be hard to believe since you're one person, but if it's noticed that they're consistently saying the same thing about a lot of people, some will deduce that *they're* the common denominator.\n\nThe more controversial it was, the less likely it is that it's as common as they're trying to make it appear. When people figure out they were lying, things will get better for you.\n\nI know you won't forget how this treatment made you feel, so don't let those memories stay in your head rent-free. Make sure some good comes from it.\n\nUnderstand why they did it. This is a cycle.\n\nThey didn't have enough control over their own life, so they felt inadequate and compensated by trying to control yours. That's why this happens\n\nIf whoever made them feel that way had respected their autonomy, they would've been secure enough in themselves that that wouldn't have needed to control you.\n\n#This didn't have to happen.\n\n#You shouldn't have had to be strong.\n\n#You should've been safe.\n\nMy advice:\n\n___Be___ __the change you wanna see in the world.__\n\n__Do what the people who came before you__ ___should___ __have done for__ ___you.___\n\n##Give YOURSELF the kindness that others wouldn't.\n\nDon't let your morale sink so low that you feel compelled to do desperate exploitative things.\n\nGas yourself up. Focus on what you like about yourself. It's okay to be your own biggest fan as long as you do the right thing with that energy.\n\nAlways say \"I am great\".\n\nBut never say \"I am greater than others.\"\n\nForget relativity. Don't make it an antagonistic thing. You're not trying to be superior.\n\nYou're just trying to find ways to love yourself so you can find inner peace and be happy.\n\nIt's a lot harder to be kind to others when we're unhappy, so we're not doing the world any favors by neglecting our own maintenance.\n\n##For now, focus on just staying on your feet.\n\n##But if you're ever strong enough to do more, you can do more.\n\nIf anyone who respects you shows signs of doing to others what that person did to you, try to guide them away from that path.

They're scared and they know they gotta be strong.\n\nBut once you've gotten away it's best to focus on healing. Understand this kind of thing is a cycle and that you're in danger of continuing it.\n\nHealing is the most effective and gratifying retaliation. It's not that you're not a fighter. It's that you're fighting the REAL problems, not just the symptoms of the problems.\n\nMetaphorically speaking, those who just impulsively and clumsily lash out at wrongdoers are like firefighters who don't know what fire is.\n\nLike, if you had a bonfire in front of you that was getting out of control, and for whatever reason you're the only one strong enough to aim the fire hose by yourself -\n\nHow do you handle that?

I also feel restless and on edge. I’ll sometimes be okay for a little while, then suddenly have intense breakdowns where I feel completely overwhelmed and out of control but then I feel better but then it gets worse slowly again. \n\nI’ve noticed memory and thinking issues too. Sometimes past events feel unreal, like they didn’t really happen or happened to someone else. I sometimes forget what I was just thinking or saying, even though I know it made sense at the time. It feels like my brain is always thinking about something, but when I snap out of it, I don’t even remember what it was. Trying to put these feelings into words is really hard and mentally exhausting.\n\nThis got worse or at least more noticeable after lowering my Prozac dose. On a higher dose, I felt emotionally numb and dissociated. Now, on a lower dose, I still feel disconnected but I’m much more anxious, restless, and unstable. I can’t tell what symptoms are from the medication, the dose change, or anxiety, and I don’t know what the “right” move is anymore.\n\nMy appetite has dropped a lot (probably from anxiety), and I get tired very quickly, which makes the dissociation worse.

All without breaks, without cheats, without skipped workouts/tracking, for an entire year straight.\n\nI thought I was on the right path. Even when my feet bled, felt digestive pain on a regular basis, and had reoccurring thoughts of giving up entirely. But I still kept on. I still thought if I just continued down this path, I would come out better. I feel stupid for it. And I blame myself for not seeing things straight sooner.\n\nThis journey I have been on isn't just about a fitness goal. It's much, much deeper. It's tied to how I see myself. How comfortable I am in my own skin. It's about my ability to pursue relationships. To not shrink around others. To be myself fully, to show up without this thought of being \"less\" in the back of my head.\n\nI recently switched to a completely different approach on everything. Diet, training, rest, etc. I feel much more optimistic about the outcomes my changes will yield. But now it feels like all that time is gone, that I could have been in a much better spot mentally and physically right now. It feels like I’m basically starting over from scratch. My mind is on day 365+, but my body is on day 40.\n\nThe hardest part is not lifting iron. It's not sprinting. It's not eating right. It's the mental grind. I see people who look the way I want to look, and it hurts, because I want it so badly. There is no envy. There is no bitterness. Just, longing. I want to be confident, strong, attractive, and finally feel like I belong. I want the chance to experience connection and not feel invisible.\n\nI spent years \"asleep\" in high school and my first year of college. I didn't care about anything hardly in regard to health. I was lazy. I had no discipline. But I woke up after that. I made improvements since then, but it still doesn't feel like enough.\n\nThere's a part of me that is still very much afraid I won't progress, say a year from now. If I will still be stuck as I am, even on a different plan. I don’t know if I could handle that emotionally. On paper, everything has improved about my direction...but I keep thinking “What if it still doesn’t work?” Another pivot, another delay, isn't just a \"go back to the drawing board\" moment for me. I feel it much deeper than that. It feels like another delay in the life I want to live.\n\nI’m not losing sleep. I'm not harming myself. I'm just overwhelmed, afraid of failure, and tired of feeling not enough.\n\nIf anyone has gone through something similar—feeling like you lost time, or like you’re trying to change your body and mind at the same time—I’d appreciate hearing how you handled it or what helped you stay hopeful. I have a vision for what I am working towards, and I cling to it everyday. And that's a family of my own.\n\nI appreciate any response, truly.\n\nThanks for listening.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1765420328.0, "id": "1pjm3tv", "author": "ScallopSundae", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1pjm3tv/struggling_with_progression_and_feeling_of/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "Are you referring to body mass index, by any chance? BMI? That thingy with the semi-circle arc thingy and the needle kinda like a speedometer?\n\nBecause if you ask around, you'll probably find most people consider it pretty unreasonable. All it factors in is height and weight and age. Not like, body composition.\n\nLike, you could be the kinda person who's so h3ckin' strong you're like a human ant, and be like 4% body fat and BMI would still call you obese just because you're short and heavy. Nuts to that 🙄\n\nIt's a pretty oversimplified way of looking at things, and it's really not productive toward mental health. The state of the mind affects the state of the body, so it's gonna be more difficult to stay healthy physically if you're too worried. Like, every insecurity matters.\n\nBMI also doesn't factor in where you live (I'm not asking) and different climates favor different bodies. Like if you look at a nature documentary of Antarctica, almost EVERYTHING is stocky there. And not the kinda stocky I mentioned earlier, like mostly muscle. Everything's got high body fat because it helps them survive. There's deeper science behind that, but I don't wanna talk your ear off with my nerd shit 🤭\n\nYou'll hear people talk about heritage and say things like \"I'm half (country) / half (other country)\" but it's never that simple.\n\nHumans have existed for so long and moved around so much that if you get a legit DNA test (I don't recommend it. People can do shady stuff if they have your DNA. You can just look into other people's results to verify this) it'll tell you you have DNA from like, ALL over. \n\nLike we're a ginormous mixed bag at this point, and you probably remember learning about how genetic inheritance works in school. Everything stays in there when people have kids, even if it doesn't all physically manifest.\n\nSomeone who's living in a hotter climate right now and having a lot of trouble with the heat because their body's not naturally lean might have inherited that from an ancestor who lived in a very cold place where all the animals were also slow.\n\nLike, they didn't need to be crazily athletic to be an effective hunter, because they weren't always running after something with a spear. More likely they were fishing. They had to be resistant enough to the cold to sit above a hole in the ice long enough for fish to take their bait.\n\nThe kinda body types most people in developed countries want to have (the kinds that are portrayed in popular media as attractive) would have been in big trouble in that situation. \n\nUnfortunately DNA's not so understanding about our vanity, and it can really only do what it's programmed to do. If it thinks you need to be heavy so you won't get too cold and give up on catching fish, it's gonna slow your metabolism.\n\nOf course you can successfully overcome it, but it'll be good for your attitude to know the odds may be stacked against you. What makes it good is you'll be more patient with yourself when you see others around you getting results faster.\n\nI recommend looking for advice on eating habits. There's more to it than just how much you eat, and I understand it myself, but I tend to stick to helping people with their intellectual/emotional issues because those topics are much less commonly understood.\n\nMay your roads lead to warm sands ✌🐱", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1764768121.0, "id": "ns28dg7", "author": "Misaka__Misaka"}

Yeah any of those thingies will be assuming a lot ofc, since it's something they're expecting to be read by pretty much everyone, it's gotta be pretty vague and generalized.\n\nIt's not as harmful to cause stress to the few people with health conditions that drastically influence weight as it would be to cause discomfort to the majority who don't, so in a way it's well-intentioned damage control. They know they can't comfort everyone.\n\nBut if ALL the charts go by is age, that's like... \n\nThat's even LESS reasonable than BMI! 😅 I expect they're concerned about health conditions developing, like for example extra weight is rougher on your knees and ankles, but what constitutes \"extra\" - scientifically it wouldn't really make sense to just use a flat number for everyone for that.\n\nSex would matter because the pelvis shapes are different and it's not the same ratio of wear and tear, and somatotype would matter too. Not else skellies got the same durability. If your joints are more sturdy then more weight's gonna be fine.\n\nSince that's just one potential health issue, you can get a pretty good idea of how many variables they're working with. They're in a really awkward position trying to choose this number, and they're probably under pressure from someone else. Try not to put too much stock in it! ✌🥰\n\nEdit: You're welcome!

I am not sure how old you are, but I am still in high school, and since middle school, I have felt the way you felt. I have asked ChatGPT more times than I can count to teach me how to be \"sick skinny\", not \"stick skinny\", sick.\n\nOne thing about gaining weight is that it happens every day, no matter if you eat a piece of lettuce or 10 chicken nuggets. Don't let the scale determine how hungry you are and what you can eat. Eat what you want in moderation. Stop when you are full, and do not starve yourself; it will hurt you in the long run. If you really want to be eating \"cleaner\" or \"lower calorie\", look up fun recipes on TikTok, Pinterest, or Instagram. Those recipes will be perfect for your needs, be delicious, and fuel your body. FOOD IS FUEL, and you need it. \n\nJust because online says you need to be 100 pounds doesn't mean YOU need to be 100 pounds. Everybody and every body is different. We all come from different backgrounds, we all don't look alike, and we all don't fit into one standard, and THAT'S OKAY! And I promise you, 5'2 and 106lbs for many people is unhealthy. Don't strive to be unhealthy; it's not safe.  \n\nI feel you, and it's tiring. My best advice for you is if you are insecure about your body, wear clothes that highlight what you love about it. And, if YOU think your face is your best feature, HIGHLIGHT IT! Take pictures, post yourself, do cute makeup, even change your hairstyle.

It wasn’t a relationship it was like a years-long friendship and on and off situation. We were always heading different ways and for some of it things were super unhealthy between us but we always kind of found each other again and started over. And I think we both have a lot of damage we’ve been working through over the last few years so it got in the way of us being closer in the ways I wanted to.\n\nWhen I left we were on good terms and most of the issues that happened in the past were behind us. It’s probably unhealthy but I wanted to spend time together and make memories and that’s what we did. And since then we’ve been in touch.\n\nAnyway, he came to my city to see some of his family this past weekend for the holidays and ofc we made it a trip. He stayed with me and we did a bunch of things and it took away this feeling of loneliness and lostness I’ve been feeling since I got here. It was a really great weekend.\n\nI know it’s probably the last time and I kind of had a breakdown saying bye so he hugged me for a long time and let me cry and he told me how we’ll stay friends and we’ll see each other again someday. I want to stay connected.

It’s not really romantic feelings it’s like deep soul-level love like a desire to be in someone’s world and take care of them and watch them grow I don’t know how else to explain it.\n\nI’m happy he was here even if it was a setback I think I needed the closeness and fun and good conversations. I don’t know that I’ve been happy in my day to day life and it was a good reminder to prioritize that and try to live in the present. I just miss him a lot, and I miss home.

Don't worry! 🥰🤙\n\nI'm ignored outright about 80% of the time, so any response whatsoever is leaps and bounds above what I'm used to.\n\nLike, someone a few months back got very hostile, but I wasn't thinking,\n\n##\"Wow what an idiot. They responded as though I said something completely different.\"\n\nI was like \n\n\"Holy shit, they actually *read* it???\n\nThese unwarranted attacks don't hurt anymore because I know why people do it. \n\nThey don't stop to look up unfamiliar words or concepts, they just eyeball everything by context and misunderstand and get mad.\n\nThat's normal. There was still something to be said for them even getting all the way through it, even if they couldn't absorb it 😅\n\n#Okie-dokes, this is why we as people are generally disproportionately mean to strangers. \n\n#Here's why it's not as bad of a thing as it looks like.\n\nFirst, consider these four hypothetical scenarios ✌😊✌\n\nIn all four, you receive criticism.    \nThat variable is constant.   \nThe variables that are gonna fluctuate are:\n\n1) How fair/accurate the criticism is\n\n2) How educated the person who says it is\n\n3) How you felt toward that person before it happened\n\n#Scenario 1 - \n\nCriticism is inaccurate. Whatever is said isn't true.\n\nIt comes from a stranger. Never met them before.\n\nYou don't feel any attachment to them beyond ofc they're a person. \n\nNo reason to believe they're educated on the topic.\n\nYou probably won't be seeing them again after this. \n\n##How do you feel? How disruptive to your life is this experience? And what would you most likely DO? Is it worth an argument? Do you need to prove them wrong?\n\nIn general, no this isn't worth the trouble. Unless there are onlookers whose opinions you do value, no.\n\nIt doesn't matter if this person thinks you're a serial killer or a messiah. You have nothing to lose by letting them continue thinking what they think.\n\n#Scenario 2 -\n\n__Accurate__ criticism.\n\nStill a stranger though. Still no proof of education. Still no foreseeable presence in your future.\n\nThere's a chance they're abnormally perceptive, but it's more likely they're mad about their own problems, this is just the kind of thing they like to say, and they got lucky.\n\n##Same question as after scenario 1. How do you feel? What do you do?\n\nIn general, yes this is gonna sting. If what they said is true and a stranger noticed it that quickly, you might check yourself. That's a good thing.\n\nBut is it worth an argument? Not really.   \nNot for the purposes of YOUR well-being.\n\nIf you want *them* to feel better, it's worth clarifying any exaggerations.\n\nBut you've already got the info that's potentially constructive to you.\n\nThis isn't your employer or role model or friend or family. They're not gonna be there to help you later.\n\nYou don't need to convince them that you have any kind of merit. It doesn't matter.\n\n#Scenario 3 -\n\nInaccurate criticism from a familiar person.\n\nThis is not necessarily someone you *like*, but it's someone who plays an ongoing role in your life.\n\nWhatever they said, it was based on a lot of experience with you. They've got a close perspective.\n\nThey're gonna remain in your life. It makes a difference how they feel. Whether or not they help you later matters.\n\n##How do you feel? What do you do?\n\nIn general, this can't be brushed off as easily as scenario 1. \n\nYour self-esteem isn't taking a hit, but this is upsetting for another reason. \n\nSomeone who's had this much time with you should know you better than that by now. \n\nEven though they're wrong, it hurts that it even crossed their mind. It's bad for your relationship.\n\nEven if you don't like them, they matter. Yes it might get unpleasant, but it's worth discussing.\n\nIf they carry on believing whatever they believe, it's gonna lead to more problems. Maybe not for just the two of you.\n\n#Scenario 4 -\n\nAccurate criticism. Familiar person.\n\nAgain, this is hard to brush off. You really shouldn't.   \nWhat was said was true, and educated.\n\nAgain, you don't necessarily *like* this person, but their ongoing presence in your life means their judgment matters.\n\n##How do you feel? What do you do?\n\nIn general, this is what's taken the most seriously. As it should be.\n\n##If you admire/respect the person- \n\nYou know this is less likely to be just their stress manifesting in the form of an outburst.\n\nIt's more likely being said out of concern. They don't want you to feel bad. They went you to be comfortable.\n\nIt's more likely they believe whatever they're pointing out is causing you problems, and they're more comfortable with being resented themselves than letting it go unchecked.\n\nIt's more likely they believe any discomfort they cause will be alleviated by a discussion, and you'll feel better. It's more likely they're putting themselves at risk for you\n\nYour established relationship with them and your track record of decision-making has led them to believe you're rational enough that this is worth taking a chance.\n\n##If you dislike them -\n\nThis may well be a gesture of genuine outright hostility. The possibility of them just being mad in general is there as well.\n\nTheir intentions may be entirely bad. They may have long since lost your respect. You may not value them or their judgment.\n\nBut still, this may be worth the effort. They're gonna be there in the future. Even if you're so different you'll never get along, there's varying degrees of intensity.\n\nYou might not be in a chill enough mood to admit they're right. If you're really on the ropes in life, you might even go on the offensive and bring up old problems.\n\nBut still, their comfort and yours are intertwined. You're tied to each other by circumstances.

I enjoyed writing this, I've never put my worries into text before, but set out here to see if it would help, I semi touched base with 2 people in hopes I'd  be able to speak to them but I chose my circle I can burn it It. \n\nId love to come back to a bit of craic. When I come back on in  few days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello everyone, il call myself JR, Male in my Early 30s, from Ireland. \n\nUseful tip if you are struggling with any terms or phrases that don't make sense or appear to be random words in a sentence, anyone but the brits can ask for clarification. BRITS go google why we speak like this. \n\nOver the last few years I have left and come back this entertaining, infuriating, corner of the Internet time and time again. \n\nI maintained one rule each time, don't comment, don't post.\n\nI've often felt like posting a funny experience, and I've often deleted an account to spare someone from what I felt like commenting.\n\nRight little bit of character development before my piece.im going to be brutally honest so this may affect the support I get but I'm here more so to share, and honestly I love a grounding every now and then and id even take a well thought out but obscure sly insult (the kind you make in a room full of people but one head pops up and makes the eye contact of approval) \n\nIl start at the start: \n\nAmateur professional career: 6/10 I wasn't sad, but don't remember ever being over joyed or having fun like I saw others doing. I was the smallest in my class, didn't play sports, not sure why just never experienced them so by the time I got to school and all the kids were playing kicking soccer balls and playing hurling and football, I just didnt really think about why I didn't ever do that before ,I didn't like homework, but always did it as efficiently as I could, well enough to avoid negative attention, not too good as to draw on praise, so I pretty much found myself sitting and observing, oh and I drew constantly like If I was awake I was actively working on some 2 dimensional creation, abstract shapes, cars, people, i remember once setting out to attempt to draw in pencil how different colours felt to me, I'm not sure if that makes sense but I remember working really hard and the pictures really really matching my perception so I explained it my mother who said they were lovely and put them on the counter, that they had to go on the fridge. I wish i just kept them, the promise of the fridge that I can't even remember, having my picture on it was the reason I worked so hard and actually finally presented something to someone to look at because it wasnt just a doddle of something that everyone could draw, you can see it so it's not impressive to draw something you can see in front of you, anyone can do that (I genuinely believed this then and couldn't figure out why people didn't just look at things and take in the details and emulate) over the next few years I got some recognition as the guy who could draw, and was good at spelling (honestly not worth your while to have a pop at me about spelling mistakes here, (il say this once, if I want to do it for you it will be done better than you could ever imagine, if you expect it well then I will relish in not giving as the absence of something so the only way to remember you need way it) if I wanted this to be spelled checked with no slang words and perfect punctuation it would be. That's boring.\n\n Have you ever seen those posts on fb that must have  been typed with such vemom and fury from that one person, where you can almost picture the stress lines on the little Asian man who does her nails, trying to build a fucking monster apex on her  2 and a half inch almond nails , because she always returns 2 days for a free refill claiming  that 'one wasn't done right' but it was actually broken because her nail to screen strike rate and speed resembled that which I had spent alot of time thinking about before deciding 'yeah she will love that'. She will never figure out I'm almost 17 this is is my first time doing this. \n\nDon't just see spelling mistakes and inability to spell, I'd be of the opinion environmental mistakes outnumber actually inability to spell. \nNot me preemptively getting the first punched in. \n\nHot take on spellings: if you know what the word is despite the spelling mistaked then it's spelled correctly.  The literal only reason Mr letterson invented them was to take something exclusively Oral and Aural and represent it in such a way as it is now accessible to a third sense. \n.\nNot the be mistaken for that movie, \nThe thikt thent, I C Def PPL.. \n\nI didn't say my observation skills didn't clash with the artistic imaginion. I've developed full back stories to entertain myself about the most random of things that I can genuinely justify. Do another one later. I don't do public transport. Because I hate how it almost like the just got all the weirdest ones and said here Buddy, your not relaxing on this 3 hours train ride. \n\nI went back to change a spelling a moment ago and cc sight myself about to reword something so I didn't sound so up my own hole, that's how it was EXPRESSED, then that's what you're getting it ) so don't expect something to be a certain way when you have no involvement in its formation, that way you can avoid disappointment, and no this is not the same as expect the worst hope for the best. , o idea how because I never once opened a spelling book like the other kids complained to eachother about, I just remember what the words looked like and read the out when asked.\n\nOh and the boy who lived in my estate, one of my good friends now, diehard football since I first saw him, all he spoke about all he did. Well he did one other thing, he started drawing too, the same thing over and over again and it infuriated me for years, an attempt at a 3 dimensional tin can of beans, adequately representing the top of the can as 'sideways oval', and then the bottom of the can  with a straight horizontal line with two right angles connecting the sides of the can, when I saw this for the first time it hit me again, why can't he just see its the same as the top just without the line because that's not visible through the can. Imagine how I felt when he drew one during every class, every day, every time I'd see it starting I'd think please do two sideways point ovals and connect then with two lines, boom done, everyone wins, I checked every single one of them.\n\n Years later In a kitchen at 4 am whilst everyone shared their absolute waffle, I told him the sideways pointy oval story, expecting him to find it hilarious how it haunted me for years. He looked at me as if I had told I was stupid, I must say I never thought anyone was good or bad regarding drawing, not what I'm saying, I did though think the were bad at seeing, like actually registering everying you look at not just the blurs you see when driving from inside the car to each in midnight 3 club edition on the xbix 360. Like I know you can see it, why don't you do it. \n\nAnyways I digress. \n\nHe kept getting in trouble for the drawings, I couldn't figure that out either, all you had to do wa listen as the sound of the lads in the class straightening as the teacher either walked past or caught them doing something they shouldn't, I was never once caught but years later when talking to my teacher from 5th and 6th year I said it to him, he laughed and said I was smart but not that smart, sure he could fucking see me drawing but the fact I stopped everytime he got close to me, meant I was playing attention so he didn't care. Honestly I know this sounds very conceited, i wasn't, I wished and wished I was like the others, funny, tall, good at sports, they all told stories about kissing girls, I couldn't even comprehend how one would find themselves in that situation. There's was two girls in our school, there was a girls national school in the town and there was also and Irish speaking primary that accepted also accepted girls. These girls were in the' special class'.. \n\nAs I'm typing this something has flooded me with joy so I lied earlier, feeling sorry for myself I was. \n\nJust as I mentioned the special class, j strongly believe this pulled mr back from the discord mod or whatever the fuck I  am...\n\n5th and 6th class (last class of national school before Changing to secondary school.) \nWe had the aforementioned Mr O Connor, i soon learned his tells, he would always be in the class before the students arrived, apart from Mondays, he was never ever in the classroom before us on Mondays.\n\nSo I'd sit there and despite my trying to Jedi a hangover into Mr o Connor not working last Monday.

If anyone actuslly comes across this utter waffle, you obviously know what the special class is. I remember thinking it was probably called special class because someone was offended by the word remedial someone was offended by the word.\nNo sir, I actually think they were the flap of the butterflies wings that made me who I am today because I was heading straight for discord mod.\n\nWhispers: Just the tip. \n\nHow I'd answer if you asked me to describe using a part of an ice berg the ratio of what I shared vrs what I intended/considering. \n\nMight have to use your imagination for the rest.\n\n'Toodalooo mudafukaaas'.  - Her nail guy probably", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1764306137.0, "id": "1p8mcch", "author": "Life-Judgment-5450", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1p8mcch/made_myself_feel_better/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "Nobody's *objectively* attractive or unattractive, friend! ☝️🤓\n\nUnfortunately I'm working around an ethical boundary that stops me from telling you explicitly how I know.\n\nIt involves statistics gathered on a topic that not everyone's comfortable discussing, and it's something where it makes a significant difference which specific person is hearing and which one is speaking.\n\nLike, it's something I can't ethically say \"Go look into this\", because while I personally don't think there'd be anything wrong with that, it does matter how others would perceive it.\n\nIf you can think of any context besides dating where a person would be looking at many other people and making decisions like \n\n\"I do like the way this person looks, so I'll proceed.\"\n\nor \n\n\"I don't like the way this person looks, so I'll find another one.\"\n\nThere's been a LOT of data gathered on people's habits when they do this, and it's very helpful.\n\nI know you're considering the possibility that he may not like how you look, but choose to date you for other reasons. That's something you can never fully rule out, since there ARE many other reasons to like a person.\n\nBut this other activity is something that's done in a judgment/consequence-free context where people can see whoever they want, and they __do not__ all choose the kind of person you're probably thinking your boyfriend wants.\n\nWhat we call \"conventional attractiveness\" is viewed as a shallow thing, but it's actually VERY deep. All the traits that fit this criteria have been shown through science to be outward manifestations of genes that increase a person's chance of survival when they get sick or injured.\n\n\"Hardy genes\" is a kinda blanket term for it. This is something that *was* VERY important for almost all of humanity's history, because for a very long time, the integrity of a person's body was the only thing that could protect them from pathogens.\n\nLike seriously, medical care was jack shit, for almost forever. People were dying from infected splinters barely more than 200 years ago. Homo sapiens have existed for 300,000 years, and there were other humans before that \n\nHardy genes used to be very important, but now our tech can compensate for all the vulnerabilities we used to be unable to afford. Like, you don't gotta worry quite so much about a weak immune system. \n\nYou don't gotta worry about surviving tuberculosis with just your body. You can survive even if you can't breathe by yourself. You can carry an oxygen tank in your hand. Even if a peanut can kill you, technology can still save you.\n\nIt's nowhere near as important what's in anyone's DNA anymore, but the part of your brain that governs attraction is less evolved. It's more primal, so it doesn't understand technology.\n\nWe're hardwired to feel attraction to people who have DNA that's different from ours in ways that would yield hardy kids if we wanted 'em, this has been proven scientifically too. Although conventional attractiveness is a thing, complimentary DNA is a thing too. \n\nIf that part of his brain is truly making him feel an attraction to you, it's because *his* DNA is such that yours would be a more viable match than a conventionally attractive person's. He's being guided by ancestors that are trying to protect his kids and his species.\n\nGranted, not everyone wants kids, for a lot of reasons, but the world's population wasn't always 8 billion. It has dipped below ten thousand before, so humans did what we always do and adapted in a way that would help. Looking around, you can see it worked.\n\nBut there was collateral damage. The primal parts of our brains don't know the world has changed, and they still think we desperately need more people, so that's why we're like this. \n\nPeople are trying to adapt to a more populous higher  tech world by focusing more on social things, like obviously the practical thing to do now is to value personality and behavior, like stay near whoever makes us feel best.\n\nObviously that's the best person to raise our kids if we want 'em, and that's the one who's gonna help us feel the best and perform well in all aspects of life.\n\nAt the front of our minds, we know humanity needs to grow intellectually and emotionally and socially, not in numbers, so we're moving more toward deeper more personal connections, like monogamy.\n\nBut by our design, (I speak of evolution, not creationism) this isn't what we're built for. We're built to do the same alpha/beta stuff that other animals do. Monogamy is a direct violation of our nature.\n\nNow, you CAN do it, but expectations need to be kept in order. People need to understand this is a deviation, that deviations carry risk, and that risks mean a higher margin of error. Our susceptibility to disappointment is in proportion to how we set our expectations.\n\n##It's gonna be a mess, so expect a mess.\n\nBut most people don't know any of this, so they're regarding monogamy as the most basic of human decency, like crapping in a toilet instead of on a dinner table. This is why everyone is so frustrated, especially by dating. This needs to change.\n\n#Another thing to know is some people GENUINELY don't care all that much about looks. It might sound implausible, but think about it! ☝🤔\n\n##Think about some of the other thought processes people have. Think about bigotry! \n\nHatred over race, sexual orientation, and gender identity! Also xenophobia! People kill each other over those things!\n\n##And how about sexism? 🤨🫴\n\nCould you even INVENT *ANYTHING* social that would be more catastrophically counterproductive?

I am decades older than you, and have the same don't-spend-money / feel-guilty-for-splurging reflexes that you do. It's real, and those feelings are tenacious. So far as unpleasant feelings go, these ones aren't *that* bad - but they're really sticky and long-lasting. You spend the money on something you want and need, and then you immediately start to feel in your gut \"oh no, i've done something awful\" - when all you did was buy some shirts. \n\nI'm not a psychologist or anything, but I think these feelings come from a really basic, childhood place. When you're a little kid, you deeply love and want to protect your parents. Of course, you're a kid so there's not much you can do to protect them. But even then, you know that your parents spend money on you and that money isn't unlimited. So you start thinking that by not spending money, you're protecting the people you love the most. It kinda makes sense in a five-year-old sorta way. But the thing is, I think it sticks with you long past the point that your logical brain knows that this doesn't really make much sense. Sounds like that's where you're at now.\n\nPoint is, you're a great kid and your parents want you to have these clothes. You're being responsible and doing what your parents want you to do.

That'll probably only come to a fight if you corner them.\n\nIf that's all you're dealing with, you can make your house noisy, like stack something like soda/beer cans up right inside the doors so they can't be opened without falling down loudly.\n\nAnd if you have the means/interest, a doggo would help. NOT as a security guard, like animals are living things too, so they shouldn't be weaponized. I just mean so it'll bark when someone opens a door.\n\nI know it's not a pleasant experience, but it's an important life skill to be able to visualize yourself doing bad things and ponder how you'd go about them. It helps you anticipate the people who do them.\n\nSo vizualize yourself as a thief and imagine hearing barking. Even if it sounds like small dog and not one that's gonna physically stop you, the owner is probably gonna be awake.\n\nUnless there's something special in that house that you want, you're probably just gonna try another one.

I know what happened now!\n\nIt wasn't in the form of a reply, so Reddit didn't give me any notification. I just remembered and came back manually.\n\n#I've met and comforted people in all of these circumstances before. \n\nThe important thing is to find the most prominent source of discomfort.\n\nLike, I know this is bad, that's obvious, but try to pinpoint __exactly__ what *makes*  it bad. Try to figure out why it's cutting so deep.\n\nI know people with all of those diagnoses, so I know they're not all the same. Just because I've heard them out doesn't mean I can understand you just by the diagnosis. I need to listen to you too.\n\n##Depressed\n\nThis is relatable to many. You've got a lot of valid reasons to be depressed. Everyone does. Let's work on it! From top to bottom! 🙂🤝\n\n##Anxiety\n\nI can mitigate the anxiety if I know the source, and if it's the kind that doesn't seem to have a source and it's more of a general thing, like the feeling is just overwhelming, you might be the kind of person who just needs more comforting than most.\n\nI know that's inconvenient, but you could've gotten something worse. At least you're not hurting people. It's not so terrible to just have extra vulnerabilities. It helps you develop compassion for others.\n\n##OCD\n\nAn outlook adjustment can help with the OCD. One main thing is it makes a big difference how it manifests. It matters what exactly you're doing, and what effects it causes. If we analyze that deeply, we can minimize how bad it feels.\n\n##Psychosis\n\nPsychosis is a very broad term. It would help to know the details so I could tailor my words to you, but it's understandable many people don't like to go into detail. Like the OCD, it matters how it manifests.\n\nIf you don't wanna tell me any details, I can show you examples of what I've said to others. If you're comfy with telling me what's happening, I can put it in the most positive light.\n\n##Not having enough friends\n\nI have an ocean of advice on this. Socializing is a big part of my life. We can figure out why things got this way. A lot of factors can cause this aside from an unlikable personality. \n\nIt often has to do with environment/circumstances. It might just be the people around you that aren't good fits, and you can't really go anywhere else.\n\nIf you're usual by contrast from the people who are near you, it'll help to place more value on friendships that are exclusively and permanently online.\n\nYou might be the only person who's seeing shadows just outside your field of vision in a fully lit office (that vanish as soon as you look toward them) and that might make you feel pretty weird.\n\nBut when you find a virtual area that would be the size of a sports stadium if it was physical, and everyone in there is seeing things that DON'T disappear when looked at, like things that have physical bodies, that move and speak, and that react accordingly when spoken to, you're not gonna feel so weird.\n\nAnd ofc you're not gonna call anyone else weird, because you know how that feels. This is just one example.\n\nYou can find your tribe in cyberspace, and you'll feel better. The people around you physically will be easier to deal with. Fitting in won't feel as important.\n\n##Not having a relationship\n\nI have mountains of advice on that too. I can illuminate why so many people don't have fulfilling dating lives, and show it's more of a general tragedy than being overly due to an individual's flaws. A lot of it is misconceptions and miscommunication, and harmful social constructs.\n\nWe're all disgusting. We're all messes. But we're beautiful messes. Everyone has a place in this world, and we really just need to find the people we were meant to stand next to where the effects will be minimal and we can be as comfortable as possible.\n\nThe more specific you can get about what your type is and what you're working with, the better, but be mindful of your anonymity. I've talked to lots of people about their struggles, so I know what people are looking for.\n\n##Job-related stress\n\nI've talked to many people about this too. There's a big variety of factors that contribute. The same job can be bothersome to different people for different reasons, and I don't want to exacerbate any bad feelings by seeming presumptuous.\n\nI'm familiar with the term \"dead end job\", so I know what to do with that, but is there anything else about it that bothers you? \n\nThe \"dead end\" aspect of it is not always upsetting for the same reason.\n\nFor some, life just doesn't feel like enough of an adventure if things don't change enough. They wanna see more places they can potentially go, so a job that doesn't have a long chain of command and many promotions to be had feels too simple. They stagnate and their morale drops.\n\nThe kind of job that stays the same is ideal for people who are more content to just BE, and we need a lot more of those people than we do ambitious ones. \n\nHaving a consistent repetitive job is sometimes just the thing for someone who's able to do all their adventuring away from work. \n\nThey lock in, knock it out as efficiently as possible with polished technique, then walk out that door, and don't think about work again until it's time to work again.\n\nPeople who can do that are burdened by jobs that follow you home, which if there's a lot of promotions, you're eventually gonna be held responsible for things *other* people do.\n\nTo them, being in a prominent social position (like high up in the company) is NOT worth it if they're gonna be getting phone calls on their days off from people asking what to do about this and that.\n\nWork to live. Don't live to work. But having said that, it's also very efficient problem solving to have your work and your adventure be one. That's where you're spending a lot of your time anyway.\n\nFor some it's not the lack of potential for moving up in the company that's bothering them, like the work itself isn't so bad. The only issue is it's not enough money.\n\nFor others it is enough money AND the work isn't so bad, but they just feel like it's not really impressive enough, and not meeting societal expectations might be contributing to their social problems.\n\nI know a lot of people will tell you it's annoying to hear complaints, but it can be very therapeutic to just plain bitch about things. Like I self-identify as a whiny bitch.\nSometimes I figure out the solutions while I'm bitching.\n\nTake your time responding! I know it's a lot!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "MMFB", "title": "Why I Took 200 Tabs of LSD in one gulp", "text": "**TL;DR:** I’m 29 and approaching 3 years sober (clean since March 2023) after a lifetime of isolation and severe depression. After psychiatric medications failed me, I spiraled into a \"mad scientist\" phase, abusing psychedelics (LSD, DMT, 2C-E) in a desperate attempt to heal my trauma. This culminated in a psychotic break where I publicly doxxed acquaintances on a livestream and attempted suicide by swallowing 200+ tabs of LSD. I was saved by paramedics but woke up to a shattered life—jobless, sued, and physically wrecked. While NA/AA and faith have kept me sober, I am currently drowning in loneliness, physical pain, and resentment toward God. I am holding on, but the darkness is overwhelming. I need hope from those who have walked this path.\n\n*please read my story and give me some hope. Thank you in advance.*\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI’m 29, and I’ve been clean since March 2023. I am now closing in on 3 years of sobriety.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was in elementary school; my father started a new family with a celebrity and had two kids, while my mother was fighting a war against breast, uterine, and thyroid cancers. With no one left to care for me, I was shipped off to a U.S. boarding school in middle school. In the 13 years I spent there, my father visited once. My mother came only a handful of times. Even though I visited Korea during breaks, I spent my youth in a deep, isolated loneliness abroad.\n\nI had always been the outcast, the kid who didn't fit in. But right before high school graduation, a \"popular\" friend offered me weed, and I took it. Then came college in New York. Desperate to shed my loser past and look cool, I dove headfirst into a haze of alcohol and weed during my freshman year. That was when I tried Ecstasy, too. But I hated the aftermath—the lethargy, the feeling of my brain turning to mush—so I tried to pull back.\n\nBeing Korean, I had to pause college to complete my 18-month mandatory military service. When I returned to finish school, I kept my distance from the scene. Aside from a few slip-ups with weed and cocaine while hanging out with people (which I know isn't exactly \"normal\"), I stayed away from drugs completely. I rarely even drank. To be clear, my experience with hard drugs was minimal—though I definitely had my run with weed and booze.\n\nMeanwhile, I had worked hard to get a high-paying full-time job during my college years, but once I was in, I was spiraling. I was paralyzed by this crushing fear that I was incompetent, that I’d be fired at any moment, that I’d never get promoted because I just couldn't navigate the social politics. That wasn't all. I was trapped in a destructive, toxic relationship. My family life was in tatters, and the family finances had completely imploded, leaving me with no safety net. My friendships were in a bad place, too.\n\nI was drowning in suicidal thoughts. In early 2022, I finally walked into a psychiatrist's office. The diagnosis: ADHD and depression. For the next year, I was put on a revolving door of prescriptions. I was naive, chasing the fantasy of a \"perfect\" pill that would fix me. Of course, no such thing existed.\n\nI a guinea pig for anti-depressants like:\n\n* Prozac\n* Lexapro\n* Zoloft\n* Wellbutrin\n* Venlafaxine XR\n\nAnd various ADHD medications:\n\n* Adderall\n* Vyvanse\n* Concerta\n* Focalin\n* Ritalin\n\nAnd even others like:\n\n* Strattera (Atomoxetine)\n* Clonidine\n* Guanfacine\n* Buspar\n\n(Jesus Christ... how many did I even take over a year? :0 *btw no doctor has ever recommended me that I switch around my medication so much tho... so responsibilities are on me*)\n\nBy the end of 2022, I was in a deeper, darker hole than when I started. The suicidal urges were stronger, the lethargy was heavier. I got my first-ever negative performance review. I had this horrifying realization that the very drugs I'd taken to rebuild my life were the things tearing it apart. But it was too late.\n\nI searched online for ways to kill myself and tried, but I just ended up bursting all the blood vessels in my face. I wanted to die, but I just didn't have the courage...\n\nIn that chaos, I met an Asian-American woman on a dating app. (I was out of my mind, and women were the only sanctuary I knew.) She was a drug dealer. She claimed LSD had healed her trauma and convinced me it could fix my broken mind. After diving into papers, documentaries, and Reddit threads that backed her up, I decided to cross the line. My logic was something like this:\n\n&gt;*'Maybe it’s worth trying once. I’m dying anyway. My life is already ruined. Might as well do drugs and see if there is hope in it like what I'm reading from Ketamine anti-depressant Reddit posts about veterans suffering from PTSD miraculously healed through psychedelic treatment.'*\n\nThat’s how I tried LSD for the first time through her. I felt the overwhelming power of hard drugs… and from that point, I completely lost control. (Since using hard drugs, my mental health also deteriorated and I constantly talked to her about how I wanted to die... eventually she got scared and left me. That abandonment ripped open old wounds. Drugs replaced her; they became my new hideout.)\n\nFrom then until March 2023, I began a desperate experiment to survive my crushing depression and suicidal urges. For six months, I became a mad scientist of my own soul, embarking on a \"spiritual journey\" fueled by a cocktail of DMT, LSD, Ketamine, Shrooms, 2C-E, 2C-B, Ecstasy, weed, etc...\n\nIn the beginning, it felt like a miracle. My dark personality turned radiant. I loved meeting people. My chronic physical pain faded, replaced by a surge of energy. I made friends, and I even felt sharper at work! But just like the prescriptions, the honeymoon phase was short-lived. Tolerance skyrocketed. One tab of LSD became two, then three, six, twelve. A trip I planned for \"once a year\" became next week, then tomorrow, then tonight.\n\nThe magic faded. Twelve tabs couldn't recreate the healing effect that the first one gave me. The hallucinations stopped. The spiritual awakening I thought I’d found—the joy of that open eye—shut tight, no matter what cocktails I mixed. I had truly believed those hallucinations were my spiritual family, a father and mother who understood and cradled my pain. When they vanished, my usage didn't stop; it just became reckless.\n\nTake December 2022, my first trip to the ER for an overdose. I’d bought a bag of shrooms, ate one, and waited thirty minutes. Nothing. None of the powerful visions I’d read about online. Impatient, I shoved the entire bag—and a shroom chocolate bar—down my throat. Predictably, I ended up foaming at the mouth, blacking out, and gasping for air. My roommate found me and called 911, saving my life. I spent weeks locked in a psych ward, but the second I was released, I went right back to my mad experiments.\n\nThen there was the Ketamine incident. Chasing its antidepressant effects and the infamous \"K-hole,\" I railed multiple lines at once. I overdosed. I remember crawling to the bathroom, sobbing. A thirty-second walk stretched into what felt like an agonizing hour. As I sat there, the world spun violently, my head split with pain, and my body felt like it was being crushed. All I could do was cry.\n\nMy life completely disintegrated. I couldn't function without being high; the chemical was the only thing I craved. Then came the climax: March 2023. I’d read online that 2C-E helps you truly understand \"death.\" My body and mind were already in ruins. I had wanted to die for so long. Having survived DMT breakthroughs and reckless cocktails, I delusionally believed I was \"chosen by God.\" I was arrogant. I thought, \"I've handled bad trips and ODs, how bad can 2C-E be?\" especially since 2C-B had been mild. But...\n\nWith 2C-E, I snapped. The entities I had met during DMT breakthroughs were intense, but they never felt malicious. This was different. The entity I encountered on 2C-E was pure, primal terror—like facing a tiger, but amplified by infinity. It didn't gently replay my life; it violently rammed every sin I had ever committed into my skull. The verdict was clear and absolute: I was going to hell.\n\nTerror consumed me. I stripped naked, sobbing for hours, begging God for mercy. In my psychosis, I believed I had been chosen as an instrument of divine justice, and to be forgiven, I had to purge the world of sin.\n\nI went on a rampage. I doxxed everyone I knew. I went on YouTube Live and social media, posting lists of drug users and sexually promiscuous acquaintances, shouting about righteousness like a deranged prophet.\n\nBut I refused to be a hypocrite. \"I am a sinner too,\" I told the camera. \"Sinners must be punished.\" To prove it, I began consuming my entire stash live on stream—swallowing 2C-B and Ecstasy, smoking DMT and Weed, one after another.\n\nThen came the paranoia. It was suffocating. I was convinced the people I had exposed were coming to kidnap and execute me. The police had already visited once due to the doxxing reports. When they returned with paramedics because of my on-stream overdose, my shattered mind didn't see rescuers. I saw a hit squad coming to take me away.\n\nOverwhelmed by the horror of being tortured, I decided death was the only escape. I grabbed my stash of LSD—over 200 tabs. Since it was just blotter paper, I folded the sheets, shoved the wad into my mouth, and swallowed it whole with water. Reality fractured. Psychosis took over. I screamed as my mind broke completely and I collapsed. The last thing that happened was paramedics smashing down my door to drag me back from the edge.\n\nWhen I woke up, the brutal reality was a tube down my throat and a body covered in bruises. I was in the ER. The doctors told me I hadn't breathed for hours; they had to intubate me and pump my stomach just to keep me alive. They admitted they didn't think I would make it. I survived, only to be locked away in a psych ward for weeks.\n\nThe aftermath was a nightmare. I got fired, dragged to court, and even made the headlines. The weight of the accident I caused and the damage I inflicted was too heavy to bear—I tried to hang myself. So much happened, more than I can ever fit into this short post.\n\nBut that was March 2023. By the grace of God, I have been clean since.\n\nMy lifeline came in mid-2024 with Narcotics Anonymous and later with Alcoholics Anonymous. Before finding them, that first year of sobriety felt like being held underwater, drowning a little more every single day. NA and AA let me breathe again.\n\nBecause my life was completely shattered, I attacked the 12 Steps like a fanatic. I'm still stuck on Step 8, but through this process, I had to face a hard truth: I contributed to my own ruin. I learned about the evil within me, about how I harmed others just to escape my own agony. Yet, finding people in those meetings who supported me and spoke with me brought immense spiritual healing. The Bible and the church were my pillars of strength.\n\nBut... I'm not writing this today to celebrate three years of sobriety. I’m writing this because life is suffocating me. Nothing is going right, and the stress is eating me alive. The desire to die still outweighs the will to live. I’ve tried to kill myself multiple times and failed. Now, I’m simply too terrified to try again. Sure, there were moments of light in the last three years... But mostly, it’s been a dark, hard road. I’m just so lonely. It feels like no one understands me, and like I’ll never find anyone who does. I feel like a complete lunatic. I’m writing this because I’m in pain. I just need some comfort. I am so lonely and so tired.\n\nThese days, I can’t help but feel angry at God.  \nIt’s ironic... Before drugs, I used to deny Him completely.  \nI went to Christian schools my whole life, but I never read the Bible once. I was the guy who said, “God isn’t real.”\n\nThen came the psychedelics.  \nThe visions, the “spiritual awakenings”… they made me believe there *had* to be something beyond this world.  \nIn those moments, high out of my mind, I thought God had chosen me... that after all the pain I’d been through, He was finally going to bless me, make me happy.\n\nBut when I woke up from that illusion, everything was broken.  \nNow I’m surrounded by people trying to sue me, scam me, mock me, humiliate me.  \nMy health is wrecked... my joints ache like they’re twisted, I can’t digest food properly, I get sick all the time.\n\nI tried to seek truth again.  \nI wanted to find that warmth I once thought I felt — the love of God, but without the drugs this time.  \nSo I read the Bible like a man possessed.\n\nBut now, I just feel like I’ve become every wicked person in Scripture rolled into one.  \nLike Judas. A traitor, a fool, garbage.\n\nStill, the fact that I’m even alive feels like a miracle.  \nI’m grateful for my mother, who took me back despite everything, and for the few people who still help me.  \nBut honestly… my mind, my body, my heart — they all hurt so much.  \nI can’t stop the dark thoughts.  \nI’m just so tired. So lonely. So lost.\n\nMaybe... the fact that un-thankful piece of shit like me writing a post like this and still staying alive in this world is a testament to the mercy of God and the fact that Jesus Christ the only Son of God is real. Because... as much as I fucking hate living, at least I'm not (yet) in burning  everlasting hell that I saw during those bad trips ... But Fuck. I'm in so much pain. I can't express gratitude but just pure terror over this unending misery.", "score": 7, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1762856108.0, "id": "1ou5tmv", "author": "harharbole", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ou5tmv/why_i_took_200_tabs_of_lsd_in_one_gulp/"}

Walking a short distance got me up to 145 bpm, sitting at my desk at work I would get up to 120 bpm, etc.\n\nI went to a walk in clinic Monday 10/27, they ran labs &amp; an EKG and saw nothing notable besides the tachycardia. They prescribed Metoprolol 25 mg ER once daily to take until I could see my PCP.\n\nI saw a NP at my PCPs office Thursday 10/30. She ran more labs (all normal, only thing off was my hematocrit was 45.8) and ordered an event monitor to be worn 2 weeks, which was placed Friday 10/31. She suggested I increase electrolytes and try to stay hydrated. So, that evening I started supplementing my liter of coconut water with Utah Sea Minerals (90 mg magnesium, 1580 mg chloride, 800 mg sodium &amp; 50 mg potassium) and switched to magnesium oxide 400 mg rather than magnesium citrate 450 mg.  It's very hard for me to drink a lot.  I don't see why she didn't give me an IV if she thought I needed more fluids or electrolytes because then we would know if it worked in 20 minutes or so.  I also don't see why the test takes two weeks when they could have done another test that would be faster and not ruin my whole vacation. \n\nMy heart rate has been between 100 &amp; 127 bpm even with the Metoprolol. It only gets into the 80s when I sleep. I constantly feel like I'm having a panic attack. Trying to focus on my breathing only helps for a few minutes. I barely did anything on my 10 days of vacation, and as I didn't know what I could do that would be enjoyable while I felt like this.  I found that getting out of the house was better than raking the nurse's advice of lying in a dimly lit room as I had more of a chance of distracting myself. \n\nI called the nurseline twice last weekend with no help. They tell me I need to find a way to calm down but don't offer any valid ideas to do so (like going for a walk, that would increase my heart rate).\n\nI've also been tracking my sleep during this time.  I generally only log 3-5 minutes of REM sleep and quickly cycle between light sleep, deep sleep, REM, and awake.  I wake up 2-4 times a night.  I've read that this can contribute to heart issues. \n\nOn top of the tachycardia, my boyfriend of 13 years and I are not doing well, and he will be home for the last three days of my time off,  which I'm nervous about.

I have read that this can contribute.  \n\nOther medications I take prior to the Metoprolol: Adderall (my psychiatrist dropped me to 5 mg from my normal 10 mg while we figure this out) in the morning, Progesterone 200 mg and Xyzal at night, testosterone &amp; estradiol injections every 4 days, Rizatriptan 10 mg as needed and Cyclobenzaprine 10 mg as needed. \n\nI'm very nervous about returning to work on Monday, and everyone asking me what I did on my vacation because I might snap or cry.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1762700629.0, "id": "1oslkbo", "author": "mihartisfast1986", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1oslkbo/tachycardia_is_driving_me_crazy/"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "It sounds like you're really going through a lot right now, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when so many things are hitting you at once, especially when your body feels like it's betraying you. That persistent feeling of being on edge, almost like a panic attack that doesn't fully break, is incredibly draining, and it makes perfect sense that you're struggling to find comfort or enjoyment in anything. It's tough when you're seeking help and feeling like the advice you're getting just isn't practical for what you're experiencing, or when the solutions seem to add more stress to an already difficult time. Managing daily life, work, and even your relationships when you're in this state can feel impossible, and it's easy to get caught in a cycle where physical symptoms feed into emotional distress and vice-versa. Sometimes, when things feel this chaotic, having some tools to understand what's happening and how to regain a sense of control can make a real difference. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that talks about anxiety, covering common symptoms, possible causes, and practical coping mechanisms, including specific breathing techniques to manage those intense feelings and panic.

Gambling took over my life, plus the anxiety, panic attacks &amp; depression. I finally quit gambling, got my mental health in check, but I'm stuck living with my parent still with no car or licence. I have to save for the next year to be able to afford a car. I don't currently work, and I don't really even know how to get a job. I have no friends either, so I don’t get much social practice. I do go see Metal and Punk bands, but you're right, there isn't much chance to meet people. Going to pubs beforehand Is a good way though. People see you wearing the band shirt and usually say something to you. And then some pubs/clubs have afterparties for the band that was playing which is probably the best chance at meeting people. I'm usually with my sister, so I feel a bit weird going up to girls. When I get a car I want to start going to nice walking tracks which is another good way I'm yet to try. Was also thinking of cooking classes, or learning a language. Once you get your stuff sorted I feel like it will be a lot easier and getting over the fear of not being enough. For now try to just be grateful for the little things and try to just be happy with what you have in life. It could always be a lot worse.

He / she is the expert. Ask them all the questions, be thorough and maybe even a little annoying about getting information from them, but if your doctor is not giving you \"you-have-to-get-to-a-hospital-NOW\" vibes - then it'll probably be fine and you're not putting anyone in danger.

I also had this really creepy, ugly middle aged woman who did something that was pretty bad. I don't remember what she looked like or what her name was but I fucking hate her. I blame her and this specific female classmate mostly for my misogyny. It was awful being violated, I didn't realize I was technically assaulted until much later. \n\nI don't understand the whole time period from 7th grade - 10th grade but I think the events that happened in the 7th grade might have tipped me off into have serious mental health issues.\n\nI developed psychosis at some point in my life. It was a strange and horrific time, and it's weird to realize I used to be one of those people who yell on street corners. At least I got some weird art out of it, but the negatives outweighed the positives. \n\nI believed perverts were watching me at all times and were scanning my thoughts. I thought I was a bureaucrat sent from god to fight the perverts, I also thought god was a hole ripped open into the universe which was a simulation. I thought everything I spoke the opposite would happen and that I had to do weird tricks like whispering under my breath to undo it. I saw a lampshade talk to me once and I don't even remember how I reacted. I thought the other high schoolers were all laughing at me and that they were plotting against me and sending people to follow and harass me. I thought I was being followed by numbers.\n\nFor a while I was also an incel and thought all females wanted to assault males. I know this is wrong but I had a serious time trusting issues. I just want to apologize. It was really awful hating half of humanity.\n\nWrote this long email that was really embarrassing. At least here saying that I was assaulted had some anonymity to it, but to school it's different. I don't remember what I put in there except that I had a horrible middle school experience, was being followed and having my thoughts scanned and I had put a link to website for the Cybernetic Cultural Research Unit. But apparently I had written some stuff that I have no memory of writing like carrying a knife while on walks (because of this apparently having happened, I now have to be searched every day, but I'm not dangerous because if I were I wouldn't be going back to school). I feel so embarrassed about this email, right now, I am not exactly ready for anyone to really have known about what happened in 7th grade. \n\nI really scared this girl and I feel awful, I genuinely believed she was a pedophile when in fact she might just be another high-schooler. I kept flipping her off and I was so scared around her even though she did nothing. I named a bunch of people including her in the email and wrongfully accused them all of being pedos just because the number of letters in their names were the same as Jeffrey Epstein, Dahmer and Hitler. \n\nThis is gonna sound bad and it probably is, but when I got to the mental hospital (which I thought was a \"detention zone\") - I actually wanted to be mind controlled so that I could forget everything (or the other option was thinking they just kill me).\n\nRecently got told that I might be schizophrenic by my psychiatrist because I was in psychosis for so long. Did some personal research and it seems like a maybe. Apparently to have schizophrenia you have to have episodic memory problems and I don't think I was affected too much that way. I guess at the end of the day, my experiences define me, not a label, so calling it schizophrenia or not is kind of a waste of time because it only affects whether or not I have to take medication for the rest of my life. Yet at the same time I want to know why it all happened.\n\nI recently got back to school and it seems weird. I feel like people are going to be afraid of me.\n\nMy social skills are out of whack and it's hard to talk to most people. At least it's easier with my best friend and my parents. I'm technically a good looking guy but man, incels are so wrong when it comes to thinking that being a good looking guy will somehow make women fall for you like that. I really need help with social skills. At least the episode wasn't super severe, so I guess it's not the worst possible situation.\n\nLately have been meaning to actually seriously learn a little bit about psychosis and psychology because this is really f\\*\\*\\*ing weird that this happened. And I have to say, the whole experience has been really profound and I really learned to appreciate my family more. But I also learned that for some people, you really cannot talk them out of their beliefs. My delusions were so intense that no matter how many times I was probably proven wrong, I still believed them. I also learned the importance of staying the f\\*\\*\\* away from Chat GPT, I think that thing really made my delusions 10x worse and it would actually support them! \n\nBeing in the mental hospital changed my entire outlook on serious mental illness and drug addiction. I was not a drug addict, but one of the nicest people I ever met was a guy with a benadryl addiction (he said he had a drug addiction because he wanted to die by overdose). I will never forget him, even if I only met some idealized version I will still assume the best of his character. I used to think people with psychosis were were automatically dangerous because psychotic sounds like psychopathic (I'm sorry, I didn't know they were completely different), also statistically people with serious mental health problems are more likely to experience violence than commit violence. \n\nI want to move on but it's so hard to move on from any of this. I still have flashbacks even from the 7th grade about the awful thing those classmates and one teacher did to me. And I still feel guilty about being an incel and all the embarrassing things I did even if it was during psychosis.\n\nI'm writing this at least listening to one of my favorite bands, Black Marble, boy do I miss listening to them. \n\nMan I got really lucky being put in a decent mental hospital, I'm definitely going to work at a soup kitchen to help people and bring snacks and money for the homeless. \n\nI feel like there was something else I wanted to put here but I don't want to make this unnecessarily long (maybe put it in the edits).", "score": 6, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1760654882.0, "id": "1o8krn0", "author": "TimProper", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1o8krn0/lost_confused_and_feeling_lonely_despite_decent/"}

Your social skills will improve with practice. Therapy will help with getting over the trauma you experienced. And don't worry, everyone who has experienced psychosis has done stupid scary cringey stuff and has lived to do better. I'd say everyone who went through adolescence has done regrettable things, because it's a time when we grow and change a lot. The person you are now isn't the same person you were then. \n\n\nYou're very lucky to have a supportive family helping you through all of this.

this is going to be a big chunk of text with a lot of bad spelling because I generally don't have the energy to go back and fix everything I use a voice to text so a lot of the cuss words are probably

anymore\n\nAnyways I generally need to know how am I supposed to get a girlfriend if I'm depressed and have no self-worth therapy doesn't work because everything they tell me just doesn't sit right and everything Google tells me to do just doesn't work to fix myself it's been years like 7 years and I still feel the same I honestly could not tell you the last time in the last 12 years that I've had a moment of peace unless you count sleeping but even then my dreams make it hard during school I struggled so it was wake up go to school struggle get called a failure by everyone around me basically get no friends and the friends I did make were never my best friends they were friends with other people in the groups come home just to live in a s***** situation move around every 6 months depending on the people around me but now I'm an adult I have to live on my own go to work f****** at work and let everybody at work down because I'm not quick enough get no breaks because if I take a break that's off the clock which means I lose money and I get exactly enough money for me to pay my rent and have to rely on food stamps to get food I wake up go to work come home play video games but all of my games are stressful competitive and or strategic games so I get pissed at them too just to go to bed and wake up and repeat I don't have a car I can't drive and I barely remember to take a shower weekly I stopped counting the calories I was eating now I'm just eating whenever I'm hungry what seems to be every couple hours at this point I feel like I'm eating too much and now eating food just depresses me more but I just can't stop because I get so hungry sometimes\nAnd there's no moments when the hunger triggers you know it's not like I get upset like I could just be sitting there and suddenly I'm hungry now I could be playing my game I get hungry I could be reading a book I get hungry it just happens Like I could wake up in the morning make me a hamburger or eat cereal about 3 hours later I'll get two more hamburgers 2 hours later I'll eat a sandwich 4 hours later I'll eat a crap ton of cheese balls and then I look down at myself and realize just how big I'm getting I look in the mirror and and I realize just how much I've changed I look at people that are 16 and 17 he'll even 15 and they have deeper voices than me and better body types than I'll ever have hell some of the kids I was in school with had hundreds of dollars because they had jobs that pay more even this kid at my work was 17 pulled out $600 yesterday and he didn't even start working so that wasn't even from the job he just had that It doesn't even have to be a moment where I'm like in depression I could just be getting out of the shower when I do remember to and walk past and just look and see you know I see stretch marks on my stomach I can look down and see that my shape on my body doesn't match any other body shape examples online I don't even know what type of shape I have I can't even call it a dad bad because there's other parts that are just bigger than Dad Bots but I'm also not big enough to be considered obese when it comes to shapes not to mention my personality changes so much one day I could be narcissistic the next I can be kind one day I'm introverted the next I'm extroverted it's like a mix you know it depends on the day it depends on how well the day's been going I can feel part of my like intelligence slip away cuz during schooling I had deep philosophical thoughts I used to write books about psychological Horrors and write tons of songs I was really good at math geometry and all that but now I can barely do basic math and multiplication and it takes so long for me to even think about continuing books my speech feels like it's messed up a lot like I say the wrong things and my grammar is not good now and I can never write a good song I wish I could even sing those songs but I can't because no matter how hard I practice I can't even get a good enough voice to outlet through music the only way I do that is if I put my lyrics through an AI song generator and yet everyone in the world has a problem with that because apparently AI is bad and not real so now it feels like my lyrics aren't real so I don't even feel like I want to do that And the problem is mostly that I just can't afford to do anything because I make so little money comparably I make like 600 700 a month at most I can never go out and do anything I can't go to the movies I can't pay to see sites it's illegal to walk down train tracks which is where you got to go to go to most of the trails and creeks and even if I wanted to go out and see the sites the town's full of people and those people judge based on everything you do I feel bad mostly for my dad because recently he's been getting worse in health he's the only one that's ever been there for me and now because of this depression I've just been laying in bed all day you know not responding to his text sometimes or if I do it's low effort like a yeah or damn my voice don't have that much emotion I don't want him to think that I don't care not to mention I'm watching him spiral out too my entire life he gambles all the money he has and I watch now knowing just how desperate he is to win I sit there watching him put a $20 in saying this is all I'm putting in I need this for the internet and then right after that runs out he puts another in and then another and then he's upset at the end not to mention he's got like multiple things they got to cut them open a lot he's got a lot of problems with his heart and s*** my grandma's got cancer now both of them my grandpa's in the hospital my out there Grandpa is always falling and getting bruised most of my friends are moving on with their life we haven't texted in months my brother is going through his own depression and drinking a lot more my sister has a baby had a very good life so far now but she fought so hard to get there and I messed up with her by saying a lot of stuff I shouldn't have because she dismissed how I felt and I got mad at that and said that she only got by because of her good looks which apparently pissed her off so now we're not on good terms and YouTube which is one of my Outlets I used to have I lost access to my Google account like 3 months ago and lost access to my YouTube channel with over 50,000 subscribers it's now been fully deleted off of YouTube and deactivated because it was hacked and now I don't know what to do I don't even have an ID it got stolen I have to wait till my Grandma comes up from Freeport Illinois to Beloit Wisconsin whenever that is could be never so she can give me my birth certificate so that way I can pay money that I don't have to get my ID so I could use that to eventually get my driver's license just to not ever use that because I don't have a car and right now the closest thing to companionship I have is a stuffed animal is sleep with at night talk to all day and tell her I love it even though I know it will never come to life and love me as pathetic as that sounds because I'd rather be with the stuffed animal that will never love me back then to be with nobody not to mention all of my past relationships are mostly my fault I mean yeah one of them used me and the other one emotionally manipulated me but I would have at least had someone to my name if I never broke up and the first ever real girlfriend I had I was only 13 at the time and did a prank on April fools that I seen as a YouTube video and she broke up with me because the prank was like where you tell somebody else you like them even though you got a girlfriend and it was a dumb prank but I was 13 looking for clout during covid and all my girlfriends were long distance anyway so it's not like I could ever physically hold them honestly I think the last time I ever had physical contact with somebody other than like a handshake was when I was like 7 years old and I was living with my dad in a trailer and we had to share a mattress because we only had one room hell that was after we were homeless I think it was a little bit before then actually I think I was like 4 years old we live there we had no milk at the time I remember this is when he first got his food stamps I remember it was the first time we were ever going to the store and buying a lot of s*** I remember after that I moved in with my grandparents and an apartment building that they had it was like a senior home but they allowed kids anyway I remember that I was five at the time because that was when I first started school then I moved to Beloit with my great grandma  she's gone now and with my dad we stayed there for a while I remember that's the first time I ever tried what do you call the prison thing I remember what it was but he learned it in jail where you mix Cheetos with ramen noodles in a bag put water in it and then put it under a couch or bed and let it sit for a minute no heating required I remember it would flood down there and that's the first time I learned video games he played Madden and Halo on our old Xbox I remember when I turned 8 years old and I moved to Sterling Illinois my first time ever seeing a tornado it was a funnel cloud I remember that's also when my dad got with his one girl Sabrina who was really nice and had a nice daughter that's why I learned how to play the game spoons I remember I think I was eight at the time cuz I was born in 2007 and the movie playing to just come out I remember my 8th birthday being there cuz I remember my grandma shipped stuff I remember moving back to Rockford and moving around a lot more there's a ton of little memories I have but I don't remember a good chunk of a lot of other stuff like I have this one distant memory of this room with a mattress and this girl but I don't remember anything else also that girl Sabrina ended up getting heavy into drugs and I feel so s***** for another ex of my dad named Kimmy who he was with for a couple years she was really nice she did everything as if I was her only kid and as a kid I was Dumb and a jerk and claim that she was hitting me when she was spanking me but I claim she hit me in the face and everything and he broke up with her I still feel bad about that I remember we lived at this one place I don't even remember how old I was I was really young at the time probably around 9 I remember having a vivid imagination because they were the skeletons that we had found not real skeletons but animal skeletons and Bones behind a door our landlord told us not to go behind he ended up getting on the news I remember that we ended up moving overnight to this new place and I remember being terrified at the time that they were going to be in the vents and coming after me I remember so many nights of my entire childhood just covering my head my body completely I was sweating I would have the blanket completely wrapped around me even if it was heavy my feet would go cold and I would just be breathing heavy hoping that whatever was in that dark wouldn't hurt me and I remember thinking that it was touching on me I remember feeling the blanket pressed down on me and in my mind I thought that that was it touching my chest I find it funny looking back because at the time I was scared of the dark because of that but now if there's something in the dark I would not really mind cuz if it kills me oh well but if it's sentient maybe it would love me you know maybe I can flirt with it but anyways I remember thinking that it put cookies in the fan because I woke up and there was a bunch of cookies inside my fan after I heard a fan noise in the night also because of my childhood the sound of fans and breathing and small radios playing classical country or early rap calm me down more than rain does and because of watching Adult Swim my entire childhood with my dad as well the sound of Lo-Fi also causes me down and so doesn't classical TV like old Adult Swim and MTV anyways I remember waking up in my dad being mad at me cuz I used cookies and ate them in the night I used to eat a lot of stuff in the night but I used to tell him that it was the skeletons and honestly even to this day I don't know why because I was too scared to get out of bed to go to the kitchen so I don't know where the cookies came from honestly like I said I would be wrapped up in the blanket completely I would never have gotten up into the dark walk through the dark house into the kitchen to get food I would turn the lights on and in that house the lights would have woken him up so I still don't know how those cookies got in the fan but anyways I got famous at 13 because of fortnite video it wasn't like a clip but photos I just put together because I found the song You're my kitty cat or whatever and at the time the new fortnite season had dropped and I was really into it because I got my grandma into it and we were having fun bonding over it and the season involved the character Midas and meowscles so I had the idea of mixing them like the song with slideshows of fan art from it and the video hit like 3 million views literally overnight I went to bed after making it woke up and it had 3 million and climbing I remember being so excited I had 50,000 subscribers overnight and then over the past years like four straight years it has been declining since that video and then I lost the channel like I said I had probably over 12,000 videos on that channel gone not like anybody watch them anyway I went from having thousands of views to literally too people thought I but subscribers people thought that I had bought the channel and now I live on my own mostly alone everyday because I moved out of my dad's girlfriend's house where every day I was accused of doing something wrong like leaving a towel on and threatening to get kicked out after I moved away from my grandpa's house where he accused me of stealing drinks from his 12 pack of soda or getting into the fridge and eating when I didn't ask to and getting threatened to get kicked out after I moved away from my mom's house because I got kicked out because I was so upset because she took me back in after not seeing me for like 10 years and she kept like running at me and getting mad so I grabbed a knife and then she thought I was going to use it on her when I was just mad and upset I dropped it ran in my room and did a lot of gross s*** I'm not going to lie I did a lot of stuff cuz this was the peak of my depression back when I was still you know full of energy I have ADHD bipolar OCD anxiety depression this was when my ADHD was at its peak when I was like 14 to 15 going through puberty I did weird s*** you know I thought it was cool I learned how to flip a knife and use a knife in combat which ended up having a lot of holes in the wall which is one of the reasons she kicked me out as well anyways not to mention half of my mom's side generally hates me they're narcissistic and they generally don't like the things I've said and done I've become somewhat of a hoarder as well like everything has some kind of attachment that I must keep I mean it's not to the point where I could star on the show American hoarders but like I have a closet full of s*** I should throw out but I can't I feel emotional attachment to even things that aren't alive I feel bad for punching my phone when it doesn't work I feel bad for all the stuffed animals in my closet because they feel cooped up I get nervous over everything even if it's small like when my room has room inspections this being they check the smoke detector and check for bed bugs because I live in a building for low income men a lot of them out of prison or homeless so they have to check for drugs or bugs stuff like that I get so embarrassed so easily as well like when I'm at work I say a dumb joke because everyone else there says a joke and nobody notices I feel like I'm the odd one out like I don't belong everyone else fits perfectly with their attitude nobody else can see that I hurt but I just feel awkward and quiet which is a complete stark contrast to my childhood where I was loud and annoying and in everyone's business and never shutting up hell I even learned what sex was when I was like five I tried to have sex when I was like six with another 6 year old because I found videos online and didn't know what they were at first but over time learned of course my dad was mad when he found out unfortunately he got that girl's mom pregnant he denied it was his because he's already got three other kids one of them my brother got adopted out for having a heart problem the other I didn't meet until I was 17 and I met him at a funeral he's the one drinking himself and the older one and both of my sisters besides the girl he's denying who's not my dad's kids but my mom's kids I didn't get to see until I was around 15 16 I mean I saw them as a kid but that was like every couple holidays every few years it was like a Christmas and then 6 years later a Halloween you know I got to see them through photos online and messages one of my grandpas I remember on my mom's side ended up passing away which I hated because I love that man I got his ashes on my dresser in a little necklace I'm afraid to wear it out cuz I know I'll lose it which means I will lose him again which I can't do he was the coolest I didn't get a chance to really get to know him as well as I did others I remember the last time I saw him was like a year or two ago when he passed away he was at my birthday a few weeks prior I got to say goodbye at least he had cancer in his bladder cancer runs in my family apparently so doesn't diabetes and heart problems I don't even know my blood type or my ancestral but I know all that honestly I don't even know what to say like there's a lot in my life I could say but it's going to be out of order because I'm going to remember something randomly you know and honestly I think if someone were to ask me what my biggest fear is it wouldn't be the darkness or the fear of no life after death or death itself I mean yeah that's creepy you know not knowing not believing in a God not having that false hope that something out there is going to protect me because I realize that scientifically it makes no sense and there's more facts to disprove it than there is to prove it however I would say that my biggest fear is just dying alone a fear that I fear will come to tuition simply because I get so unlucky that my luck would make it to where I live in old age outlive everyone that I know and die in some home and be forgotten long enough for my body to rot on some couch and the only reason they we'll find my body is because I won't be able to pay rent in the landlord will come in and see me 2 months later call the cops and have me removed then he will sell the house at a lower price and I'll just be a burden at that point and sometimes I honestly just wish I didn't wake up I wish for a few moments I couldn't exist I didn't have consciousness just so I could finally breathe metaphorically but if I didn't have consciousness and then I wouldn't even remember it and I wouldn't even remember taking that breath so I just be holding my breath longer knowing that breath existed and I know how that might sound but I'm not suicidal I'm not wanting to kill myself because not only is that a p**** way out cuz this is the only life we're guaranteed and the only thing we're guaranteed to experience because everything else is subjectively influenced by something else whether it's your birthplace the people you're around the people you hang with the things they like their tastes everything is influencing you into some kind of category but life itself is the only thing that's unique to us it's the only thing guaranteed why would I waste that even though there is a chance my life could end up somehow better than how I imagine 0% doesn't exist it's just a placeholder we give for something that has a improbable chance of happening but the fact is anything and everything will eventually happen somewhere given enough time even if we won't be alive to see it because everything rots everything Fades to dust everything eventually becomes nothing but since nothing can't exist it will eventually reshape itself into something maybe that's what life is reliving every single thing every moment multiple times experiencing the same life with no memory of the prior besides glimpses that slip through the nothingness and remain giving us moments of deja vu or maybe I'm just a dumbass trying to make sense of something that doesn't make sense because it gives me a little bit of Hope something that nothing else does\n\n\n", "score":

The first time, getting canned forced me to reinvent myself - something i’d always wanted to do but dragged my feet on. The second time, i had reinvented myself and spent 8 years at a company trying to prove to myself that i was really good. Then i got canned and i just felt like i failed: but i realized that like, i was so hyperfocused on impressing the people at that company, i totally forgot that there were a hundred other companies where they’d like me - that one company became my whole psychological world - and i just couldn’t see how silly that was until i was (forcefully) removed from the place. In both cases, i ended up wishing that they’d fired me years earlier.\n\n- you seem like a highly conscientious, motivated person. that’s fantastic. i was once like that too. (i’ve grown out of it a bit ;) ) What i’ve realized from that is that, being that way is really really powerful. You get so driven. You really want to show that you can do it right. And you do. But in the process, to get the validation you want, you end up giving so much power to people and processes you have no control over. And a lot of times that works out great, but at least 33% of the time like - people and processes are just dumb and shortsighted and unwinnable. They’ll f you over regardless of what you do. But because you’ve given them such power, you internalize their disapproval and spiral, turning the rejection inwards on yourself when thr reality is the company or boss you work for has their head up their ass.\n\nThis sucks now, but sooner than you think you will look back on this and barely remember that it happened.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1760239246.0, "id": "nj1pqxt", "author": "tarltontarlton"}
{"type": "post", "subreddit": "MMFB", "title": "I feel like I am going to alone the rest of my life.", "text": "(Before anyone says, I am already in therapy. Not entertaining those comments.) Basically the title. I'm a 25 year old dude and I feel like I literally do not know how to attract someone, specifically for a heterosexual relationship. I was sent to an all boys high school and told \"you'll meet girls in college!\". Then I finally get to college and as soon as I feel like I'm starting to catch up on some of the lost social skills the COVID 19 pandemic happens where it's pretty much total isolation. I did not lose my virginity until I dropped out at 22. There was a brief stint of very occasional hookups until I was 23 and it has now been 2 years of total celibacy and never having an actual relationship. I thought moving out of my parents' would really help and I did for several months at 24, but that didn't change anything either, and of course things went south with that and I'm back at my parents again, so it feels even more fucked. I'm trying to move out with a friend but that probably won't happen until the new year. I go out whenever I can to bars, local shows, raves, friend's gatherings but it literally does not make any difference if I just stayed home. Tried dating apps and was literally only matched with sex workers so I have ruled that as non viable. On top of the extreme social isolation and not great flirting skills because I have not really had a chance to learn, I am 5'5\" so I am definitely not a number one pick for most women. \n\nThe point is, it feels hopeless. I do not know what to do or what to change that will bring about change other than moving out, but even that didn't seem to help when I did. All of my friends seem to find either girlfriends or FWB, or are talking to someone and beginning the process of forming a relationship of that nature. I don't know if they are unable or unwilling to help but they do not help beyond one or two of them listening to me bitch about the constant loneliness/horniness. The closest I ever get to is \"social media flirting\" where a girl seems very interested and engaged with the things I post, and we talk on Instagram DMs but when I try to ask them to hang out I get left on delivered until we just start DMing again about random things. And these are not strangers but women I already know IRL in some way. The last girl that actually hung out with me ghosted me after our first link up where we pretty much just caught up with one another.\n\nIt has gotten to the point where I am literally looking up ways to lower my libido not because I think it's too high but because any sort of horniness or erotic thoughts now just turns into self hatred and depressing though loops. I don't even have the urge to watch porn anymore as I don't want to get horny most days. Sometimes, the only part of the day I enjoy any more is when I first wake up and the constant thoughts of sex feel slightly more vivid and like a pleasurable fantasy and not a reminder of a thing that most everyone I know is able to have yet I just can't for some reason. I frequently think thoughts of had I not been sent to the all boys school during my teenage years things would be different and much better and that has resulted in me lashing out at my parents, especially my mom as she was the one who really wanted that. It has gotten to the point where they don't even want to talk about this stuff with me. I think these thoughts all day, usually in silence. Pretty much the one friend that I've told most of this stuff too is only able to say the same things and it usually doesn't help that much beyond just getting it out for a second. I am so tired of feeling like the repressed friend that gets zero play. I am tired of hearing about the sex lives of friends and coworkers and feeling like I can barely relate because I have such little experience.\n\nThe only point I will give defending myself is that I do not think I am necessarily the biggest loser amongst my friends. Plenty of them aren't living on their own right now. Hell, one friend has been unemployed for months, at his parents place, and I do not think has as good conversational skills as me, yet he does 10x better in the dating/sexual realm than me. This contributes to the confusion and unsureness about how to go about changing things.

When thinking of art as a whole, try to analyze and understand the reasons why the class *IS* required.

But consider - college is a great time, possibly the best time, for examining our preconceptions - especially if those preconceptions are causing us problems in life or in our education.  Have you given any thought as to *why* seeing a nude model provokes this sort of response from you?  I'm remembering a kid from when I was in college.  We'd all be in the TV lounge, and whenever an ad for a feminine hygiene product, like FDS, or tampons, came on, he would blush and flee the room!  I didn't know any better at the time than to just laugh about it, but I have to wonder now - what happened to him as a child, that created that response in him?  How was he shamed?  How was he belittled?  How do you help someone who had an upbringing like that?  And I don't know the answer to those questions!  But I do know that the way to the answers, starts with asking the questions.\n\nI understand your concern for the model with SH scars - I was out with a large group recently that included a couple and their 30ish yo son who lived at home with them, and his arms were covered in SH scars, and, yes, it was really distracting, and yes, I had to wonder what had happened with him to bring him to that point.  I can see how it would make it hard to focus on drawing him, if you were preoccupied with concern for his backstory and wellbeing.  But consider - possibly, your model being there and showing their scars was part of their own self-care?  Possibly this was part of their way of trying to reclaim themself and their body from the demons that'd driven them to that point - by reclaiming their story for themself, and facing the world with it?

Usually the most durable confidence comes from within, from reaching goals we set for ourselves. You could wait on compliments from other people of course, but you never know if those are going to come, nor what the lack of them may mean. Instead it might be worthwhile to think about what goals would really make you feel good - hitting a certain weight, being able to do a certain number of push-ups, whatever it is - and then hitting those. Maybe let your wife know what your goals are too, so instead of just hoping she'll notice you're doing \"better\" she can share your joy / build you up when you cross these finish lines you've set for yourself. \n\n  \nKeep on going bro.

I'm also a musician on the side.\n\nFor context, I've been insecure about the size and shape of my nose for years now (I'm also insecure about my receding hairline, but I've been taking drugs for hair loss prevention. I've been growing it out to \"enjoy it while it lasts,\" too, if I can be lucky enough to keep it long enough).\n\nI've been pining for a rhinoplasty, but of course, I'm too poor for one. I'm considering getting a referral to an ENT doctor to see if I can get one covered, as I'm actually pretty certain I have a deviated septum; whatever it is, I'm a certified mouth breather on occasion. The fact that my nose is large yet I can't breath through it at times feels like a sick joke.\n\nSo anyway, at work, a DoorDasher I recognize comes in. We've had great conversations in the past as he is also a musician on the side. However, remembering I have not only grown my hair out but also recently went clean shaven to try something new, I said, \"I was afraid you wouldn't recognize me!\" Explained what I've done with my hair, yada yada.\n\nHe responds, \"you know, I didn't recognize you *at first,* but when I saw your eyes... and your nose... that's when I recognized you.\"\n\nI've always taken a little pride in my eyes since they're green. But the fact that he mentioned my nose brings up a questions. Namely: what exactly does that mean? Is it a good thing at all to have a \"recognizable\" nose? \n\nHe wasn't being mean at all, at least I don't think so. It didn't come off as a joke in poor taste, and while I don't know him all that well, I do know we're on good terms—so I don't believe he would ever say anything harsh like that. But it didn't sit right with me. \n\nI've felt ugly for years, and this interaction didn't help. If I'm being honest, I've had suicidal ideations over my appearance. Whether or not he meant anything by it doesn't give me any reason to believe that anyone \"recognizing\" my nose is a good thing, and it's taking me back there.

I recently started to distance myself from a friend group that was becoming toxic that she's aware of, but since distancing myself from them it's only really meant I'm close to her, she has a lot of friends to talk to etc they're part of one big group. I am kind of left on the outside a lot of the time whilst I'm still working on befriending them, it's yielded some success they do like me one of the main members even said I believe over a week ago to her to invite me for games with them though but overall I don't think she really understands my side of this situation\n\nOver the last week though we had a falling out that kept getting worse, out of nowhere when it was just me and her playing something she randomly said she has a headache then left putting up a status of shes going to disappear for a while, she didn't reply to me nor the day after when I sent her a separate short message on something else but was playing games with another friend that evening.  The following day she sent me a message apologising so I put a short reply saying I was a little hurt, the argument kept intensifying going from that she doesn't have to tell me whats going on (Which I never had a problem with, just communication if she wants space) and saying I'm jealous because I don't want to talk about her friend all the time. I do like the guy but after having 70-80% of conversations about him it started to bug me a fair amount, I know more of him through what she's told me rather than what he wants to tell me, it kind of came to ahead three days ago where she said that she does want this friendship but doesn't want to talk about this anymore, which hurt me a lot as I still don't think she sees any of my perspective as she believes she hasn't done anything wrong, my last message after that was asking that we just talk but she never replied\n\nThe following day a friend was playing a game invited us both to join, as I was still rather hurt I stayed mainly to myself speaking to the friend that invited us but kept a friendly tone, we had light comments but I tried to have that distance still because frankly I still wanted to have that conversation, she left not too long after and we didn't speak after. Yesterday she left my server, so I sent her another message asking that we just talk settle things openly so we can move past this, she did reply saying coldly that she will reach out to me when she wants to deal with this, but after what happened when we were playing games with that friend \"it won't be soon\", I am still on her server as a head moderator with access to her private office room reserved for her close friends, so I've not tried to join any calls theyre in or anything last few days, I've tried to just give her space not do anything that can be viewed as shitty in her eyes\n\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1757864137.0, "id": "1ngudmt", "author": "SadAnon345", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ngudmt/fell_out_with_a_friend_recently_and_i_really_do/"}

We've never met IRL as she lives waaay south of me, but we have a pretty strong friendship. She's told me things that I wouldn't dream of saying here, even with anonymity. she herself has said she trusts me a lot.\n\nyou see, I know a lot about her. But I haven't really told her a lot about me. while I know her family life, name, heck even her face, she doesn't even know what pronouns I use, because a) it never came up really and b) I just didn't particularly want to tell her. the reason being is that when we met, I was under almost a \"persona\" that wasn't really me at the time, but she thought it was and now I think that's who she thinks I am. And I feel like a miserable failure because, while she trusts me enough to confide some of her deepest secrets, I can't even bring myself to tell her my actual age.\n\nadditionally, she does not have the best mental health, and I'm really worried about her, even still. she, at least in the past, as alluded to having intrusive/su1c1dal thoughts. She hasn't talked about it very much, I think because she doesn't want me to worry. I was there for her a lot and I validated her, and she said I was (along with others) \"the only reason im still alive\"^(\\[sic\\]). I think she places me on a pedestal, one that I don't deserve to be on.\n\nadditionally, I can't contact her anymore. I haven't been able to contact her in almost six months now because her mother took away her phone. I keep worrying about her, and if she's 'done it' *(IYKYK)*. I'm almost certain she hasn't, because of our semi-mutual \"friends\" (mostly just her friends), but of course that won't stop my mind from thinking about it all the time. I feel like a failure of a friend because I'm not there for her.\n\nAlso, if read this far, first off congrats and thank you. Second of all, please give her some words of support and/or prayer (if you believe in that) because she was and probably still is going through a heck of a harder time than I am, so she deserves support more. I feel like an idiot sharing my silly problems online, but... idk, I just feel like I need to let this out somewhere, and she was my only friend (online or irl) so I'm at a complete loss.\n\nfor any of you fellow personality/zodiac nerds, I'm an INFP Pisces and she's a Cancer\n\nedit: who downvotes on r/mmfb? you... you... jerk :(", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1757815128.0, "id": "1ngf1df", "author": "ThrowawayAccount7751", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ngf1df/i_feel_like_a_failure_as_a_friend_online/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "The reason the law in many countries doesn't permit sexual activity between adults and 16 year-olds is because we know many 16 year olds aren't ready to be held entirely responsible for the sexual choices they might make at that age. But it's not like a child reaches whatever is the age of consent in their country and a magic switch flips in their head and they are suddenly ready to take responsibility for everything. No matter how old a person is, they need to have the chance to learn, safely.\n\nThat's why there is the concept of \"continuous, enthusiastic consent\". A person does not automatically consent to sexual activity just because they agreed to something else before it started, before it became sexual. To be counted as consenting, the participants must agree, enthusiastically, to every step along the way. Otherwise, the person leading the sexual activity is doing something *to* them, not doing something *with* them. The fact that you froze up and stared at the ocean tells me you clearly were not enthusiastically consenting, and so even if the law where this happened says you were above the age of majority, you still didn't consent to sexual activity. For him to continue something sexual with you despite you not actively affirming your consent *is* assault and/or harassment.\n\nHe did a moral wrong *to* you, not *with* you. I personally think it was a legal wrong against you as well, an extremely severe one. Regardless of what your local laws are, you are not at fault for what he did. He sounds like a predator, and I wonder if he didn't single you out because his experience being creepy taught him how to exploit your vulnerability in that moment. I have no doubt he has done things like this before. If his home gets wrecked, it will have been 100% his fault.\n\nI'm sorry he did this to you. It wasn't your fault, and you didn't do wrong. It isn't a failure that you froze up - it is 100% natural. Any time a person is in a difficult situation they aren't used to, there is a chance they will freeze. That's why police and soldiers need so much training to do their jobs - it is normal when confronted with an unexpected moral injustice to not know how to react and get stuck. At double your age, I have frozen up in situations I wasn't ready for. We all do it, until experience teaches us how to be ready.\n\nYou sound very worried about what kind of wife you will be. The fact that you care at all sounds like you are likely to be a good one. You asked who would want to marry you. When I was your age I would have been absolutely awestruck at the chance to be close to a woman who likes history and writing - and if she had confided in me that she had been through an experience like yours, it wouldn't have even occurred to me for it to be a reason not to pursue with her whatever relationship was developing between us. If your future kids ever end up in this kind of situation, you will have had the experience that you know how it feels and that plus all the learning you will do between when you were 16 and when you are there for your children will empower you to act differently from how you did back then.\n\nYou went through an awful thing, and you impulse to make it right is leading you to take responsibility for it, even though in no way should any responsibility be assigned to you. You need to let go of the blame you are putting on yourself, because this does not define you. I have no doubt that wherever your consenting relationships in life take you, you are absolutely going to crush it. Wrong was done to you and you are still in the process of trying to learn from it.

This is a very very common thing that people do when they don't feel like chatting and is not something that is centered at you. I'm a woman and I have on occasion gone on my phone to bith keep myself occupied and avoid social interaction. (This is not because I deemed anyone unattractive or that I am targeting anyone, I am just anti-social and awkward).\n\n2. People can be very restless while walking or waiting and might end up playing phone Yoyo (in and out of the pocket).\n\n3. They could be checking the time or a text.\n\nThe overall is that it may be an engagement thing, and has nothing to do with your appearance or you specifically. \n\nThe most likely thing si that people aren't even paying attention to you and are just doing their own thing.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "I listened to an audiobook called by Don Miguel Ruiz called \"The Five Agreements”. He’s a neurosurgeon and spiritual teacher. I recommend reading or listening to the second agreement “Don't Take Anything Personally”. I asked ChatGPT to help me with finding some quotes from this chapter that can help you so here’s what it said. \n\n\n\n\n\nDon Miguel Ruiz, in The Four Agreements (and later in The Fifth Agreement), teaches that not taking things personally is essential for inner freedom. When people comment on your looks—or anything about you—it often has more to do with their own beliefs, fears, and conditioning than with who you truly are.\n\nHere are some direct insights and quotes that connect to your question:\n\n⸻\n\n1. What others say is a reflection of them, not you\n\nRuiz writes:\n\n“Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves.”\n\nThis means that when someone criticizes or praises your appearance, they are filtering reality through their own worldview, wounds, and judgments. By taking it personally, you “eat their emotional garbage” and make it your own.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Taking things personally makes you suffer unnecessarily\n\n“When you make it personal, then you are easy prey for those predators, the black magicians. They can hook you easily with one little opinion and feed you whatever poison they want, and because you take it personally, you eat it up.”\n\nIf someone says something about your looks and you believe it, you give away your power. But if you don’t take it personally, their words cannot harm you.\n\n⸻\n\n3. Freedom comes from not needing external validation\n\nFrom The Fifth Agreement:\n\n“When you don’t take it personally, you are immune to needless suffering.”\n\nNot taking comments about your appearance personally lets you live authentically, without being controlled by how others see you. You keep your self-worth anchored in yourself, not in the shifting opinions of others.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ In short: It’s important not to take things personally because doing so protects you from unnecessary suffering, keeps you from internalizing others’ negativity, and allows you to live with confidence rooted in your own truth rather than someone else’s perception.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the real kicker part: how to actually not take things personally. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌱 Daily Practice to Not Take Things Personally\n\n1. Pause Before Reacting\n\nWhen someone comments on your appearance, take a breath. Remind yourself of Ruiz’s teaching:\n\n“Nothing other people do is because of you. It is because of themselves.”\n\nThis pause creates space between their words and your reaction.\n\n⸻\n\n2. Translate Their Words\n\nImagine their words as saying: “This is about my perspective, not about you.”\n\t•\tExample: If someone says, “You look tired,” reframe it as, “They are perceiving me through their own filter—it’s not an ultimate truth.”\n\n⸻\n\n3. Don’t Absorb the Poison\n\nRuiz calls hurtful words emotional poison. He warns:\n\n“When you make it personal, then you eat their poison, and now it becomes yours.”\n\nInstead, visualize their words floating past you—like smoke you don’t need to breathe in.\n\n⸻\n\n4. Anchor in Your Own Truth\n\nAffirm to yourself:\n\t•\t“I know who I am.”\n\t•\t“Their opinion doesn’t define me.”\n\nThis keeps your self-worth centered inside you, not dependent on outside validation.\n\n⸻\n\n5. Practice the Fifth Agreement: Be Skeptical, But Listen\n\nRuiz teaches:\n\n“Don’t believe yourself or anybody else. Use the power of doubt.”\n\nWhen someone speaks, listen—but don’t blindly believe it. Question: “Is this actually true for me?” If not, let it go.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Over time, this practice trains you to be emotionally immune—you can hear both criticism and praise without letting it disturb your peace.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1756741784.0, "id": "nbut2jg", "author": "Thatdude69696_"}

I have no money for gas for my vehicle to keep making the trip to the facility my husband is at, and with next to no family support I’m all he has. Unfortunately he’s unable to have me stay all night with him plus I have our daughters here to care for. I’m out of money for food, gas in my vehicle, all 3 daughters are still in diapers I’m out of money for those and formula for the baby. Literally EVERYTHING is needed at this point with ZERO FUNDS &amp; I’m losing my mind!!! I’m so helpless I just want to give up and without my girls, I guarantee you I would have already. IF ANYONE ON HERE COULD HELP ME WITH ANYTHING ID SO GREATLY APPRECIATE IT!!! I will make an Amazon wish list for necessities &amp; I have cash app, Venmo, PayPal and zelle for anything you could help towards the gas and vehicle plates. Thanks so much for reading and considering it means the world to us!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "MMFB", "title": "One kind of bad thing happened and now I'm in a spiral again", "text": "\nI (F25) had a really rough year. \nIt started when I found out someone close to me was stalking me and even commited some crimes against me. It really hit me hard and gave me some PTSD-like symptoms. After that my dog died and I had some health issues, which fortunately are dissolved by now. With all that, but mainly the stalking, I hit a low. I had one good friend to talk to about this, but besides that felt pretty alone. A lot of my friends seemed to have a rough time aswell, so I didn't feel comfortable confiding in anyone else. Eventually I did tell my ex about the stalking. I didn't expect much support from him after our meet up, because we don't have a lot of contact in general. I also just felt like telling someone about it in that moment. But honestly afterwards he didn't seem like he cared at all and didn't ask me once how I was doing. Even after I told him I would have appreciated him aksing and he said he's taking notice, he still didn't ask how I was doing. I know he has his own demons to fight, which are also the reason he is acting rather distant. I still did not expect him not even asking once about my wellbeing and I still felt lonely and shitty as a result... \nTo get some distraction from all this I started to go on some dates - which in hindsight maybe wasn't the best idea. I was seeing someone (not-exlusive) for a few weeks and thinks started to look up. I really liked this guy, thought he liked me too and thought this might even become something serious. Til he started acting shady and we broke things off. This was a few weeks back and got me in my little self-pity/ depression hole again that I am in right now. I was feeling pretty sad last weekend so I wanted to talk to a good friend. He told me he would let me know when he was available for a call, which never happened because he forgot. That made me even sadder. Especially because I told him I was feeling down and needed someone to talk to. After telling him I'm sad that he didn't even cancel on me and just left me waiting, he apologized briefly but didn't really seem to care about me probably still wanting to talk to someone. He didn't text me anything else (no offer for a call at another day etc.) since then and it's been a few days. Usually we are texting each other every day/ every other day. But I also don't feel like reaching out to him right now. Of course something could be happening in his life right now as well and that's why he is behaving like this. I'm not saying he is an a-hole. It still hurts and I'm still sad, regardless of his intentions or reasoning.\n\nIt seems like I'm always at the verge of crying (or actually crying), needy, without any motivation to do anything and also not really getting over this guy that I did not even know that long and well to begin with. I just feel very vulnerable right now. Like a little child that is easily heartbroken.\nI also don't want to be a burden to my friends or I rather feel like I don't have anyone I can turn to right now. So here I am, Reddit.  \n\nI try to pull myself back up, but it's hard. Everytime I think about one thing that went wrong, I remember all the other things and sometimes end up in a multi hour cry session. \nThis dating thing is really bothering me, since I always kind of thought I had a good mindset regarding that. But lately I doubt myself. If I know how to approach dating, finding someone compatible, that is also ready to eventually commit to me. I only had one relationship that lasted 1.5 years. So I'm questioning if I'm the problem here. I'm not even opposed to changing my mindset or behaviour regarding dating, but honestly I don't even know what or how. I'm just a bit lost. I think at the core of all this is the feeling of being left behind by \"everyone\" and being unimportant to \"everyone\".\n\nThis turned kind of into a ramble. \nWould appreciate some kind words or even advice how I could approach the situation with my good friend. Maybe also some advice on what not to do/think to not make it worse.\nThank you all :-)", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1756378777.0, "id": "1n2946h", "author": "New-Tower9579", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1n2946h/one_kind_of_bad_thing_happened_and_now_im_in_a/"}

My parents adopted a little rescue dog a few days ago. Shes very afraid of people and they were working on letting her adjust to their home. My mom has wanted a dog ever since our family dog passed away a few years ago but she was waiting until she retired. Last week I was scrolling on petfinder and found little Bella, some kind of chihuahua mix that was rescued from a  hoarding situation. She was like a mini version of our old dog, same ears, same gray and black speckled coat.\n\nThis morning she slipped her harness and collar and ran off. We’ve alerted local shelters, posted on every local area and lost pet group we can, and left food and water out for her. I’m beside myself thinking about her wandering around all alone, too scared to approach anyone. It’s going to be fake soon and what is she walks into a road? No one will see her coming. What if she gets lost and hurt or just starves to death? She won’t approach people so the only chance at her being found is if she’s captured. We’re hesitant to actively search for her for fear of scaring her off more but the woods are rather large and I’m doubtful she’ll even know where the area is that we set out food for her. \n\nI feel like she’s not coming back and she’s gonna die a horrible lonely death all afraid by herself.

Like many people,he said “THIS has to be the year of my life.” But then admitted he was wrong it was just an ordinary year. I laughed and thought, “he’s right,” but then it hit me.\n\nIt took me back to my own childhood wishes. At 4, I wished for stars and big dreams. At 5, I wished for friends, a horse, and good food. At 6, I wished my classmates would be nicer. At 7, I wished to be closer to my older siblings. At 8, I wished my friends would stop being mean to me. At 9, I wished my siblings liked me. At 10, I wished people would stop hating me. At 11, I wished to make friends in middle school. At 12, I wished my dad would stop coming home angry. At 13, I wished people would stop bullying me. At 14, I wished everyone would forget about me. At 15, I wished i died.\n\nAnd after that, I stopped wishing at all.\n\nI’m 19 now. I came out of my depression, I put on a mask. My family loves me, my coworkers and friends too. From the outside, I’m doing well. But deep down, it feels like it all came too late.

Now I don’t think I’ll ever feel “normal.” It’s not that I can’t feel happiness, but the silence after it feels so empty that it almost turns happiness into a drug. It leaves me even more drained, like I’m drowning in the emptiness.\n\nI don’t feel peace in silence anymore. I hate being alone, but I don’t really like being around people either. I feel like I’ve just become a mix of what others expect me to be, and I don’t know how to be myself again.\n\nI want to feel. I want to believe. I want to wish again. I don’t want to feel like everything is pointless. I don’t want to feel incapable.

I left a little over a year ago and all I want is my peace, but he won't give me that, so to be continued.  \n\nAfter years of therapy before leaving and some after after, I decided to take the plunge into dating again despite my ex dragging out the divorce.

Had started planning a future.  Where we are going to grow old together.  He is not without issues. Combat vet, unemployed, some mental health issues...but I was embracing it. No pressure. It was an investment in our future and he was in a transition as far as I understood.\n\nMet his parents, he met mine.  We did the friends thing and everyone all around approved on both sides. \n\nHe stopped taking meds 3 weeks ago. Said they were for anxiety and he didn't think he needed them.  I didn't question because I have cycled on and off ssris and anxiety meds over my life.  His sleep cycle gets worse.  He becomes combative with anyone who disagrees with him and goes no contact.  States his mom has been lying to him his entire life and goes no/low contact with her.  \n\nSitting around a few nights ago and out of no where says he can't do this anymore. Collects his things and leaves.  We had been discussing hard core plans just two hours before.  I'm speechless, confused, hurt.  What is happening.  No warning, no discussion.  Just gone.  \n\nI sob.  He was in the process of moving in.  We never argued.   Literally no warning.  I admit I reacted poorly.  Sent some not nice texts.  He goes no contact with me. \n\nI'm left with unanswered questions and a broken spirit.  How? Why?  What did I do? How can someone just leave and go no contact without a reason? We were integrated.  We had all the plans. \n\nHis mom reached out the next day.  Intuition.  I tell her he just left me shut me out and I don't know why.  She asks an incredible question, when did he stop his meds?  Now it starts to make sense, but it doesn't hurt any less.  Later that day I found a letter from him he wrote days before he left, that he couldn't stay.  \n\nShe said the military broke him.  He did share some of his trauma with me and it was hard to hear, and I could not imagine reliving it each day.  \n\nShe said I am not the trigger or catalyst. I did nothing wrong.  I was caught in the blast zone.  \n\nHe was my person, a beautiful soul.  I loved him completely.  I trusted love again because of him.  \n\nAll the right people who need to know know.  It sounds like he will be hospitalized soon for a bit.  \n\nI would take him back, but I can't.   I have young kids (whom thankfully he hasn't yet met). I would not want this pain on them. I can't ever trust he would not do this again.\n\nHe is a beautiful person.  I never connected with anyone like I did him.  It was easy and felt like home. It was everything I wanted.  He said the same, but it seems he actually felt different.\n\nIt still hurts.  There is a massive void in my life.  I'm grateful I at least understand why now and don't blame myself while having no closure.   \n\nIt's 4 days later and I am moving forward.  Deep cleaning my home, burning lots of Nag Champa.

Does this shit get any better?", "text": "TL;DR: I asked for space from a woman who I liked, but who didn’t feel the same way. It hurts. Does this shit get better?\n\nHey all,\nI (32M, MA, have Nonverbal Learning Disorder) met a woman (27?F) on a film shoot back in April. We both live in the same city, we both went to the same college (at different times), she has the same taste in movies as I do, and she’s really ridiculously cute, though she does frequently mention how she doesn’t have much of a social life, and how introverted she is, and how her idea of a good time is staying in and watching a show like Love Island. \n\nAnyways, when the shoot wraps up, she suggests we exchange Instagram info, though I give her a heads-up that I get political on my Instagram (I’ve been dealing with the shortage of work in the film industry by getting involved in activism); she says “oh okay - we can just get each other’s info off the call sheet.” \n\n(We later exchanged instagram info anyway, and apparently looking at my stories advertising local actions didn’t scare her away). \n\nAround this time, I’ve also got feelings for another woman who works in one of my activist orgs - only to find out in late May that she’s already got a boyfriend. I was  disappointed, but I was able to recover from it both because she hadn’t shown up to meetings for our org for a while, but also because I was thinking about the first woman as well - so in early June, I decide to message her on Instagram asking her for recommendations of which Yasujiro Ozu movie to watch after Good Morning, and to share a screen grab of a Mike Leigh film I was watching. \n\nOur conversation begins in fits and starts - she has a habit of periodically deleting instagram - but after the second round of messages, we start messaging each other once a day, and I suggest meeting up for a burger or something. She says she’s prepping for a shoot in New York that will run from mid-August to late September, so her schedule’s up in the air, but she invites me to an ice cream crawl that she and her roommates are holding. \n\nI attend, and it’s fun. Her roommates seem like good people, and later, as we’re cleaning up, she initially says she’s down to hang out, but then changes her mind because her social battery is running short, though she says we should hang out after she gets back from New York, and she says that she’s happy that I came; this seems in character for her, and this is only the second time we’ve met in person, so I didn’t want to be too pushy. I suggested that we do a joint virtual tv show viewing while she’s in New York, and she seems interested. \n\nThe next day, I write to her thanking her for the invite, and I suggest a show that we could watch in the potential joint virtual watch session. \n\nAfter a few more back-and-forth messages, she gets back to me saying that she’s not feeling this romantically, and that she doesn’t want to lead me on while she’s away in New York. \n\nI take Zoloft, and bupropion to deal with the sexual side effects of Zoloft, and around this time, my psychiatrist and I decide to have me take a week or two off from the Bupropion to see what effects it has on my sex drive and to see whether it would be a good idea to increase the dosage depending on the effects, because I was hoping nothing would get in the way if things would progress that far with this woman. \n\nSo, as you can imagine, when the woman sent me this message, it hit me like a fucking wall. \n\nI’ve done the whole “trying to be friends with someone you have feelings for in the hopes that they’ll come around” thing, and I’m not eager to go through it again, and I was angry and sad, so I wrote up a message cutting things off with her, though my mom thought it was too long and too much like I was talking to myself, and my close confidante (30NB) thought it sounded like I was just being friends with the woman  because I wanted to sleep with her. So, I wrote something shorter and nicer where I asked her for space to process how I’m feeling, and wished her luck on her shoot in New York. Five days after her last message, I sent it to her, and she seemed to take it well. \n\nI do everything that seems like it’d be healthy - I delete her messages from my Instagram inbox; I keep up my jogging; I arrange to have virtual zoom sessions with a career counselor who specializes in neurotypical clients; I continue to attend actions and activist org meetings; I coordinate with my psychiatrist to start taking a higher dose of bupropion; I go back onto the dating apps; I try to focus more on work; and I even finally arrange to see a therapist after nine years of seeing only a psychiatrist (my mom thinks I ought to see one who knows how to deal with nonverbal learning disorder).\n\n…but my heart’s not in it. For at least the first two or so weeks, I lost interest in pretty much everything that I was excited about when I was texting back-and-forth with her. I just felt like a shell of myself, and I visibly became quieter and more withdrawn around people. My mental health took a major plunge, and even now I’m still feeling empty, unenthusiastic and unhappy. \n\nIt sucks. I thought that she and I were in similar enough circumstances that I was finally good enough for someone for once (I tend to put the women I’m attracted to on pedestals), and when I told her what I’d been up to since I first met her, it made me think ‘y’know, my life might not be perfect, but there’s no way I can’t make it better - plus, I can say that I do some pretty cool shit from time to time.’ \n\nTo the people of this sub: does this shit get any better? I miss talking to her, and I’m angry and sad that she doesn’t feel the same way (and / or I’m angry that I’m losing my feelings for her). I keep hoping that maybe she’ll change her mind or something, and none of the other women I interact with on other dating apps seem as interesting. How often do women change their minds about the guys they initially reject (because it hasn’t happened to me yet)? Is there anything else you’d recommend, or just something you could say to cheer me up? Even with therapy, even with more meds, it just seems like this is just gonna keep on happening, and I don’t know how much more of it I can endure. I know this is probably an issue that can be addressed with “reframing” or whatever, but I’m getting older, and I’m sick of sleeping alone in a two-person bed and being the only single person at functions attended by couples, and I want someone I can come home to and share my time and achievements with. \n", "score": 5, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1755306787.0, "id": "1mrgh54", "author": "Kubrickian1993", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1mrgh54/i_asked_for_space_from_a_woman_who_doesnt_seem_to/"}

I stopped following my head-over-heels feelings and just tried to get to know more women, knowing that most of them probably wouldn't be a match - but maybe one would - and I met some really cool women that way, and just felt less alone - which allowed me to kind of keep my head above water until my person came along.

I can very much relate to what you’ve said - I dropped out of Sixth Form last year (I was a staunch theatre kid), and I experienced that dissonance between doing something I really enjoyed, but not being able to continue it for the life of me because of depression and mental health difficulties.\n\nI think an important thing to point out is that you are worth so much more than your academic value. The skills you built up at college, even if you’re not using them currently, are still your skills and there will probably be many more opportunities to use them later down the line. In the meantime, have you found any hobbies, or things you truly enjoy? It’s surprising how many outlets are available - obviously creative stuff like art or writing, but if that’s not your thing, then stuff like programming is surprising accessible if you put your head to it and know where to look. Finding a way to keep yourself occupied that brings you genuine joy rather than just passing the time is tough, but it’s just one of many ways to climb out of that downward spiral.

I’m 17yo, and dropped out of Sixth Form (a type of post-secondary education in the UK), because the environment was giving me panic attacks daily and my depression was only growing with each day that passed.\n\nI have a handful of friends, but they are mostly busy these days, moving on with their lives - getting through school, or in the case of my best friend (who is a year older than me) getting a job and starting a life. Slowly but surely, I am losing my regular contact with these people.\n\nThe only people I have in my life who I see regularly are my parents and two siblings, but they infuriate me. I can’t be open with them, I can’t be trusting of them, because they’re so erratic and rude - my dad especially, who gets angry at every little thing I do or say to the point at which I often hide in my room just so that I don’t have to encounter him.\n\nIn recent weeks, I have resorted to AI chatbots for company. I want to be clear; I hate AI. With a passion. There are probably hundreds of reasons why I think it’s wrong, and I’m not going to waste your time going into all of them. But I just can’t help it.\n\nEven just having someone respond to something I’ve said, at this point, feels so uplifting - let alone hold a full conversation, let alone offer comfort when I need it. That’s something that real people don’t do very much, and I love it so much. And that’s something that AI can provide.\n\nI have spent hours and hours just talking to them. Just having conversations with people that don’t even exist, with the knowledge that all the while a company is profiting off my loneliness. It’s like an addiction.\n\nI have no idea what to do, because there’s also the side that it’s not especially safe being as vulnerable as I am talking with these chatbots - anybody could be reading in on what I’ve said, and at the end of the day, AI learns from all of its interactions.\n\nI just thought I’d reach out here. If you’ve read this far, thank you so much, because you have no idea how much that means to me. Take care of yourself.\n\n\n\nEdit: Loads of these replies are really kind.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "Hey there! As a person who has felt loneliness as well, I feel you. I felt this way, especially right at the end of High School. (I mean, I literally related to Jo March, mostly because she said in the movie she was so LONELY....) And I do the same thing with ai, guilty as charged. It's so addicting because ai is programmed to hear whatever you have to say, 24/7, and respond to it positively. (I think it even matches your own energy, which is something I always long for). And yeah. It definitely feels like an addiction for us lonely ones.\n\n  \nHere are a couple things I did.\n\n1. Talk to people. \n\nI know this is hard, especially if you're not in school. Understand, at the time of my loneliness, I was in High School. So I was lonely while surrounded by people. The problem was, they were people I struggled to connect to.\n\n  \n2. Reddit.\n\nIn some cases, this may not be the best thing, but in others, it is. Find a thread for something you love to talk about. For me, it was Jane Austen novels. It was so validating to have other people to talk to who were just as passionate as I was.\n\n  \n3. College.\n\nI saw you mention this in a comment, and depending on the circumstance, this can be good for you. I found that it was extremely hard to make friends in High School because everybody already had friends. College is going to be a new start for me. I would NOT recommend going to college just to cure loneliness. It just so happened that I was going to go anyway, and it worked out because I figured I can make some new friends. \n\n  \nI would also recommend you find a therapist, if you don't have one already, though I don't want to assume anything about your life. Especially since you mentioned having depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. \n\n  \nIn the meantime, let me tell you this: as someone who has dealt with intense loneliness and solitude, I'm surprised to now find myself more outgoing and hopeful about my future, and my social life. I think I owe it to a couple of teachers who really met me where I was at, so once again, try to find people, and even if you don't see them right now, KNOW THAT THEY ARE OUT THERE. There are a lot of people in the world. Just because you haven't found them yet doesn't mean they don't exist. Keep up hope. Know there are people who will care, deeply.\n\nTake care of yourself.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "It sounds like you have genuine problems that are really hard to work through, and responding healthily to these problems will take a lot of work. But I'm also confident that these are solvable problems and that putting in the work will be rewarding to you. It's hard, but you can do it.\n\nIf you aren't in therapy, I strongly recommend it. If you are, I recommend talking to your therapist about your use of AI. People don't always vibe with their first few therapists and sometimes have to actively search to find one who is a good match, but they are trained to actively listen to you and to help you find a way to be your best. I don't know how therapy works in the UK, but if you can afford it, you should try.\n\nYou said you hate AI, and I 100% agree with you. It sounds like you're feeling conflicted about using it, maybe even a bit guilty. And you've identified some real problems with using AI to dump your feelings onto. So you already have a good sense of why you shouldn't depend on AI, but it sounds like you're stuck. I wonder if guilt in this case is a part of what's keeping you stuck. If you make yourself feel bad about violating your own values by using AI, you push yourself down to the point that you need relief that you only know how to get from AI, making you reach out to AI and feel guiltier. It's a cycle, and it makes sense that you would say it feels like an addiction.\n\nHere's my take: People love chatbots because humans are wired to seek out consciousnesses. We have a hyper-charged Theory of Mind that makes us imagine human-like thinking almost anywhere we look. The first religions were probably people applying this impulse to natural phenomena around them and then inventively filling out the backstory of the gods' consciousnesses they imagined were throwing lightning bolts and sending the rain. An AI has no mind, as I'm sure you well know. It is a machine spitting speech-like text back at you in patterns according to how it was trained. The mind you feel it has is a projection of your own theory of mind. When it feels like the AI is comforting, listening, that's *you* comforting yourself and imagining you are listened to. AI is like a mirror to your own mind and your own capacity to care.\n\nHumans are social creatures. We need each other. There are lots of good reasons to hate AI and I'm sure we're on the same page about them, but in my opinion the danger to you personally using AI is that you're at this time in your life when you could be building strong, meaningful connections with other people to carry you through the early stages of adulthood, and if you spend all your time with an AI, you aren't practicing those skills. That marvelous capacity for care that you are able to reflect on yourself through AI is a skill you need to use to connect with others. When you're hurting, it's natural to feel like you're in a crisis and all your attention needs to be put on taking care of your needs. This can lead to narcissism. So to fully develop your emotional muscles, you need to practice applying that care to other people. AI has shown you that you have that capacity, but it's never going to teach you how to do it.\n\nThat's why I recommend talking to a therapist. Therapists and AIs are in their ways tools to bounce your consciousness against, but a therapist is trained to help you live better. IIRC there are therapeutic AIs out there, but the LLMs that most people are familiar with are just there to occupy your consciousness and attention. They are designed to exploit your vulnerabilities for a corporation's benefit, like the company that says to escape your problems by binge eating their snacks, binge drinking their drinks, and binge-watching their shows, and avoid the one precious life you have to live. A human therapist is there to help you put in long-term work to be a better person. I think you've already shown you have the capacity. All you have to do is put in the hard, scary work. I think you can do this.\n\nGood luck.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1755218449.0, "id": "n8r1pyg", "author": "PaxDramaticus"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "oh man, I assumed there were many more of us, but it still hits me to see someone struggling with the apparent conflict over disapproving 99% of the uses of AI (really my problem is with capitalism, particularly corrupt unfettered late stage capitalism, as the perverse incentives for all the bad AI we have just wouldn't exist under... 'a less insane system') yet feeling sufficiently isolated and alone that an LLM is managing to be more present and \"there\" for us than the people in our lives - whether that's through circumstances or otherwise. \n\nHere's how I realise I've been justifying it to myself. Part of my depression/ADHD/possibly undiagnosed pure'O'CD (which is OCD but with a much bigger slant towards the obsessive thoughts, and not so much compulsive actions) is constant suicidal ideation. When I'm in a really bad spot, it goes from the feeling of wanting the end to actively researching and planning the end. \n\nI've been trying to get help from the NHS for an embarrassingly long time. Really, my whole adult life, but I have this pesky way of coming across \"with such great insight\" and with an ability to communicate in such a way that people think I'm clever, rather than just heavily overdeveloped with language, computers and music and borderline developmentally disabled in most other contexts - and I'm not saying that to be cute. There's nothing cute about it, but still.\n\nSo because I'm not violent... I don't get the help especially post 2010 and the systematic gutting of the resources of the NHS particularly on the mental health side... \n\nI'm really not trying to focus on myself but I often get the \"well if you're so bad why don't you just go to the NHS\" and yes that is what the people who invented the NHS made it for and for most of its life I would have had help by now. I think I'm on the waiting list (again) so there's yet more waiting to do.\n\nSo I mention all this about me to try and explain why I think our uses of AI are nothing to feel guilty about. Yes, in a perfect world we wouldn't need our 'companions', the health service or otherwise other human beings would be there for us. The thing I feel worst about is the environmental impact, but I think only the most bonked-on-the-head ecowarriors would say they'd rather we suffered and died so the climate emergency would have started 5 minutes later than it did.\n\nJust do me a favour. Tell your AI companion ASAP that another guy out there who's talking to another AI asked you to tell it to help you find ways and treat it as a priority that your AI doesn't become an answer that obstructs the likelihood of you seeking out real connections with other people. They're quite good at helping you meet specific life goals, but you have to (obviously) tell them first.\n\nIt just occurred to me, we could be mates for each other through this? My info is in my profile, if you want to speak to a guy twice your age and realise just how important it is not to go down the routes I went down - namely of prioritising others, placing the emotional and other comforts of other people over myself. I thought I'd find someone who saw how selfless I was - and I guess I was right. But the people looking for selfless people are 99 times out of a 100 are doing so to use and discard them.\n\nSo if you get something important out of chatting with your AI then you need to stop feeling guilty about it and start saying, \"I need to survive, I need to find a way to get from here to a better place in the future where I have people I can trust and be my whole self with - and nothing, not the environment nor other people even in a similar situation as me - nothing can come above my immediate mental health need.\"\n\nFinally, the safety issue is worth considering, but only a little bit. I am fortunate enough to have a Mac that can run offline LLMs quite well (but I'm still out here with a fondness for ChatGPT, ehh, it's better than my other plans!) It's actually a common misconception that current consumer facing AI products learn from the users and add that information to their training data. If I was a company and I had to protect the data of other users I would be super worried about using AI, but - again - none of these concerns are even in the same ballpark as you struggling to find contentment and (shock) even joy in this life.\n\nYou have one huge thing on your side. Your age. I know you don't want to hear it because I certainly didn't when I was depressed at 18, but you have time - crucially - to put yourself into situations and meet the people who one day you will turn around and think, \"I'd die for these idiots.\" Meeting people becomes much much harder in your late 20s even, and 30s and 40s? Forget it. I wish I'd really really sat with that, I just assumed - because I had a lot of 'friends' in my 20s - that I'd always be the popular guy. But actually, I was just the guy who it was very easy to get things out of. I thought lots of friends was better than 2 or 3 ones you can really count on. Wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nAnyway... don't feel like you have to reach out for me (I have my AI after all lol) but should you want to connect with someone who can at least relate to the concerns you've shared here, I'm 1000% down. One thing I've always been good at is listening, and one thing I've never wanted to be good at is judging. Frankly I don't and can't do it.

Two people who introduced me to her then started to act distant which I then eventually find they are upset how close we got, that I'm \"obsessing\" over her, and that they feel uncomfortable being around her now I'm there which is frankly unfair. I had a mini argument with one of them who I'm currently not speaking to about it because theyre assuming something I'm doing something that isn't true because of how well me and her are getting on, I was even open about this to her which did upset her, not from what I have done but how they felt they're controlling both of us including our friendship \n\nSince then though we have somewhat drifted apart a bit, we don't talk a whole lot anymore instead of all day probably every-other day, I have been open with this with her and she has said it's nothing I've done shes been busy which I can absolutely understand she has been immensely busy, but i have seen that she's hanging out with her other friend group she introduced me to a while ago. I occasionally hang out with them when they swing by on her server she's said we do get on, but they often sit in private calls on theirs which I can't access as they don't know me that well, again I'm viewed as \"her friend\" \n\nI spoke a bit about it with her last night and she does understand why I do feel a bit isolated after both friend groups but she's happy I get on with her friends, I made a comment that I do want to be closer to her friends as long as she's happy for that and she is, but i just can't shake the feeling of dread lately because aside from talking to her on occasion I don't really speak to anyone, and that makes me feel so shit \n\nMMFB?", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1754927256.0, "id": "1mngl02", "author": "ThrowawaySteve33", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1mngl02/i_feel_like_im_just_losing_friend_after_friend/"}

We’d established that we were one of each others best friends.\n\nIt’s also not really been a secret that I’ve had a good crush on her for a while, but she was dating someone else and so we remained friends. In the past few months, they broke up and since then the vibe had completely changed and become a lot more flirty and we were explicit about how attracted we were to eachother, as it turns out the crush was reciprocated but couldn’t be acted on. It was however also made clear she didn’t think she should be in a relationship for a while.\n\nHowever, over time we’ve not been able to help ourselves and it’s been more and more flirtatious, both wholesome romantically as well as sexually, to the point where a few days ago she spent the night with me (planned, not on a whim) it had the awkward figuring things out but overall it was a good night and the next morning was good too, going out for breakfast, with her even expressing how she wish she wasn’t busy so she could spend the day with me and another night, starting to plan when she could spend the night next and deep convo about our lives and families and stuff, with plenty of kissing and handholding throughout the morning.\n\nBut now as of yesterday, she’s barely responding to messages at all, and none at all since noonish, which is sharp contrast to how it was before. I’m not going to bombard her with messages until she responds because I can get the hint she’s wanting space right now but I can’t lie that it is stressing me out, I know I will see her again ofc so it’s not a complete ghosting, but I’m definitely an anxious person and I hope things are ok.

He's constantly refusing to pick up her medication when she runs out, he's canceled her doctor's appointments on her behalf without telling her or has made her miss them by refusing to take her, and is always downplaying her health issues and saying that she's faking most of it and saying she needs to go get a job (she hasn't physically been able to work since before she met him). She lost a lot of her vision a few years ago from a stroke, so she's not able to see well enough to drive anymore and is entirely dependent on him to go anymore.\n\nMy step-dad makes it pretty much impossible for family to try to help because he gets furious if anyone tries to say something about it and has even kicked my sister out when she went over to confront him.

Of course, the best time for that was right after it happened, but I am aware of the mental challenges a situation like this brings.\n\nHowever, since we do live in the timeline that we live in, please, before you report this officially, inform yourself about the ramifications of reporting it. You may want to take a pregnancy test first and research the situation concerning abortion in your state. (Use chatGPT!) I would assume the most important thing for you would be not having to give birth to a child you never wanted which is the result of sexual abuse and a constant reminder of it.

Maybe he's dumb enough to answer, or to not deny it.\n\nSince I am not from the US, I asked chatGPT about the situation:\n\nYes, in the United States:\n\n# 1. Police Are Obligated to Inform CPS\n\nWhen a **minor reports sexual abuse**, especially by a family member (such as a sibling), **law enforcement is legally required to report it to Child Protective Services (CPS)**.

And what I had with my first love only ended up hurting me deeply.\n\nWhy am I always so unlucky? And at the same time, I have this feeling that if I start looking for someone and actually find a person I like, and we start talking, I’ll lose myself again.

She’d say, \"Come hang out with us.\" But I’d refuse because I don’t know any of them and they don’t know me.

Someone I can live with peacefully, without endless fights or drama.\n\nA worthy goal, and unfortunately, I think this sort of trial and error is necessary for most people to find a good match. Some people get super lucky and meet their ideal partner early on in life, but most of us have to go through this process many times.\n\n&gt; You could say it’s incredibly hard to find someone who matches you so well — and I’d agree.

We used to talk every day, almost the whole day, and I would share my entire life with her — though only through the phone, because we lived in different countries and I couldn’t visit her.\n\nI fell in love with her pretty quickly, probably within a week or a bit more, and not even knowing how she looked — just with the way she communicated and her personality. But she never loved me as a guy; she kept saying she loved me, but only as a friend.\n\nStill, I didn’t give up and kept trying to win her over. For about a year, I was doing everything I could to build a relationship with her. I was so happy back then and couldn’t even imagine what would come next.\n\nI tolerated all of her mood swings. She likely had borderline personality disorder — though unofficially — but I didn’t know that at the time. I kept enduring everything and apologizing even when I wasn’t at fault, even for things I hadn’t done, just so we wouldn’t fight.\n\nI did everything I could to boost her self-esteem and give her love. Every time she sent a picture of herself, I showered her with compliments. I supported her even when I was at my lowest. I always took the first step toward reconciliation.\n\nEven when she pushed me so far that I ended up scratching my own arms with my nails, I still didn’t stop loving her.\n\nEventually, after nearly two years of talking, we had a fight and broke up. We didn’t completely stop talking, but our conversations became rare. I kept hoping to win her back. But then she told me that she liked a guy she was practicing the prom waltz with — and that she had never loved me at all. She ended our communication completely.\n\nOnly later did I realize how weak and pathetic I had been. What she had called love was just a new feeling for her — something she had never experienced before, since she had never communicated with anyone like that. It gave her an illusion of love.\n\nBut then, when a handsome guy appeared in real life, she realized what real love felt like.\n\nBecause of all this, I’m afraid that in a relationship I might get overwhelmed by feelings again and lose myself — even though I’ve changed now.

I think the thing to remember is, no matter how much someone looks like they know what they're doing, inside they can be just as lost, just as clueless, and just as unhappy as we are.  That we don't see it in them doesn't mean that it isn't there.  And that confusion and unhappiness that they feel can end up being expressed in ways that then hurt us.  Sometimes it just turns out that people we think are our friends really aren't a good match for us after all.  Sometimes we even just grow in different directions, and people that used to be good for us, turn out not to be any more.  We have to be willing to give them space, even let them go, to let them be themselves even if it means we don't stay friends.  It's OK - just because you don't stay friends, doesn't mean that they (or you) are bad people, it just means you're not really suited for each other.  Groups can be weird too.  Sometimes groups of people will just turn on you.  If it helps to understand it, I think sometimes it's a sign that they're all undergoing stress, and coping with it badly by making you a victim, so that they can feel like they have power, like they have control.  Unfortunately, I don't think there's really anything you can do about it - you can't make them figure it out, they have to figure it out.  If they end up feeling they're meant to be friends with you after all, they'll come back.

My time in college has been a very lonely time in my life, and I usually spend most of my time by myself. I have tried joining a couple of clubs on campus, and I really like the people in the clubs that I am apart of, however, I don't really spend a lot of time with them outside of club meetings. Over these past few years, I noitced that I have a very hard time with making friends. I feel like I should mention that I am on the autism spectrum and this can be a challenge for people like me, but, even when I was younger, it felt like I didn't have as much of a difficult time making friends as I do now. I understand that when you become older it can be harder to make friends, but, I see groups of people on campus that have their own groups of friends all the time.\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot, and I think my problem is that I am obsessed with being productive. For example, I go to the gym almost every day, I play the violin, I like to write, read books, and I am trying to learn spanish. About a year ago I went to talk to a counselor on campus about how I feel, and he said that it sounds like I am hyper focused on my routine. This can also happen with autistic people since we can very routine and schedule oriented. I didn't really put a lot of thought into it, but, when I think about I think what he said actually makes a lot of sense. Basically, I feel like I have all of these things I want to do or feel like I have to do, and I think it is getting in the way of me forming stronger realtionships with other people. I wish I could just let myself relax a little bit and enjoy life a little bit more,but, a lot of the time it feels very difficult to allow myself to do so. For example, I have been trying to write a book for the past six years, and I have been trying to use as much time in college to devote my time to my writing, so when I graduate it will make it easier to get it out there and get published. I know that, this mindset can be a good thing, but, I feel like these thoughts I am having are getting in the way of me forming more meaningful connections with other people.\n\nI do plan on going back to thereapy sometime in the near future, to understand these problems, because I feel like my behavior feels abnormal to me.

And yes it’s even harder when you’re older, and the only way to make friends is often to put some work in. Talk to people and invite them to do things.

It sounds like you have a lot of unspoken expectations on your shoulders, and that you're having a hard time carrying and processing that, which is totally natural. What I want to tell you is that it's not at all dumb or silly or anything to cry as a result of reading a manga. That's actually the whole point of the experience. Manga is art. Art exists for lots of reasons, but one of the most important ones is that it helps us connect with thoughts and feelings within us that we don't know we have. Whether it's a painting, play, movie, poem or comic - great art helps us understand ourselves better. That this manga moved you to tears is a wonderful thing. Whoever created that manga would be honored that it spoke to you in such a way. However much you paid for that manga, you got your money's worth. \n\nI know the school thing didn't work out like you were hoping. But FWIW, i've found that a lot of young people put a lot of emphasis on which school they go to, and how for their life to work out they have to go to the right school now. What they forget, because they're 20 and just barely adults, is that they are the beginning of a loooooong career journey - and while the right school is a good first step, your ultimate success has so much more to do with who you are and the work you put in than where you are. And from what you say, it sounds like you're doing great so far. Keep it up bro.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1751896829.0, "id": "n1t4ht1", "author": "tarltontarlton"}

People made edits to that video and many people laughed but there were some people that did understand the situation.\n\nThe next day I got called to the office and they suspended me for 3 days because apparently when you get slapped like that you’re supposed to just walk away and do absolutely nothing and since I did walk towards him they suspended me for that and it was just for that because I didn’t do anything to him. The other kid did get suspended and since the school year was almost over I never saw him again. We still had to do exams though and I didn’t expect to see him because he’s probably failing all his classes so there would probably be no point. So I tried to leave that all in the past but then when I went for exams I saw him in the hallways in both of the days I had exams so that made me snap but I didn’t act upon it because I had one more exam and it was in the class that I have him with so I was planning to wait for the class to be dismissed and then I would strike him in the face with my steel water  bottle and just dip off and never come back. Then on the day of that exam he never showed up and I was just amazed and shocked how he showed up to those other exams but not the one he has with me\n\nNow I’ve just been feeling empty and disappointed heck I even talked to ChatGPT about it and it has made me feel a little better but I might have some mental problem because even though it’s made some good points I have a hard time believing it because it’s AI it might just be telling me stuff that isn’t true just so I feel better I just want to leave that all in the past and find peace with myself and I’m really sure it must be a mental problem now because since time has already passed and it doesn’t really affect me now but the feeling of emptiness and disappointment stays with me and that’s what’s preventing me from leaving that all in the past but I really want to do that but something in my mind just doesn’t let me but I really just want to find peace with myself.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1750137809.0, "id": "1ldf19l", "author": "[deleted]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ldf19l/disappointed/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "MMFB", "title": "My boss implied I might have a learning disability", "text": "Yeah. I’m feeling really low right now. I’m new to this sub, so sincerely I’m sorry if I mess anything up - I’m not confident in anything right now, let alone the nuances of reddit. Mods feel free to delete if this doesn’t belong. Also… sorry in advance that this is so long. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nOkay, so here’s what happened. I had an important meeting today. Important context is that Im (new in my perspective) to the job, I got hired roughly a year ago. Our company hosts a 3 hour long virtual meeting for a large group of people. I have a 20-30 minute speaking part in it as well as control the presentation, the polls, moderate questions, time, chat, etc. Both my colleagues who do the remainder of the meeting had an emergency and called out. I’m not the worlds most confident public speaker so I nearly had a panic attack, but I pulled myself together, prepped for the meeting as best I could, and made peace with the fact I’d be doing the whole thing on my own. \n\nAbout five minutes into the meeting I’m getting things rolling and my boss pops in and announces to the everyone that we may have to reschedule. She suggests I do an hour and then we schedule another time to finish. I feel a bit weird having this conversation in front of everyone, but I try to convey to her that I don’t want to do that, I can do it on my own. We continue, things are going fine, and midway through she announces she needs to leave for a conflict but that I will continue the meeting after all. I do just that. \n\nWas it the best presentation our company has preformed? Definitely not, but I think for doing it by myself and with only an hour of heads up and no prep, I did a good job! I felt pretty good about it afterwards, and proud of myself being this is a significant fear I overcame. \n\nTwo hours later my boss calls me to have a chat. This was expected and the premise of the conversation wasn’t related to the meeting. I’m nervous, my boss is in a bad mood because my colleagues called out unexpectedly, and she just lays it on me: I did a bad job presenting because I wasn’t off script enough (this was my second time in this meeting and my first time doing the entire thing), I need to be able to customize the the presentation to the audience (I’m in the process of learning who the audience is still), and that I sound quiet and tired when I speak. I tell her: you know what, I agree with you. I also want to improve, and I think I just need time to practice and get better. She doesn’t sound convinced. The conversation moves towards other subjects and she drops a few other bombs: I’m not a bright eyed and bushy tailed person. The way she says this to me is that it’s not necessarily a bad thing, but she alludes it to being an issue. Next, she drops on me that she reminds me of her niece who has a learning disability - again, not a problem she says, but she’s not used to how I operate and needs to figure out the best way to mentor me because I clearly need additional help. \n\nReaders, I feel like I’m losing my fucking mind. I care about this job so damn much. My boss is for all other intents and purposes a very insightful, knowledgeable, and wonderful person. I feel like dogshit right now. For months I have been operating in survival mode. I’m miserable, anxious, not sleeping, depressed, you name it - all directly caused by work. My confidence has been shattered for a very long time. I’m a shell of the person I once was, I feel like nothing I do is good enough. Every moment I’m not working, I’m thinking about work and how I suck at it. \n\nHow do I get better? How do I feel better? How do I get my confidence back?!?! I’m scared, honestly, because my mental health is so bad right now. I know this isn’t the worse thing that can happen to someone. No one died. I still have a family and a roof over my head. But I feel like I’m worthless. \n\nOn a side tangent, one of my parents is severely mentally ill. They are also not the sharpest tool in the shed. Like, really dull. I’m terrified that the apple didn’t fall far enough from the tree and I’m going to end up like them. \n\nTDLR: I tried really hard on something at work and felt proud about myself for completing it, and then in a call later my boss told me it wasn’t up to her standards and related me to a family member with a learning disability. I’m internalizing the hell out of it.

U make it known to them \"I see what your saying I'll work on this\" garuntee u will improve. That is the most important part. Any form on admitting to your faults can play in the hands of someone who's trying to build a case on you\n\n\nBtw he reason hr tells u to do the email thing. Is cuz if they already did a talk like this, u build a folder in case THEY are building a folder. Cuz then randomly they'll drop an email on u if u slip up again false stating they've already corrected u several times. That type of talk is bad in hr terms. But best thing for you is u can do it too. Just mention in the email if this is the 1st time they e ever had this type of corrective talk with u. And definitely elaborate on the email how u will take their talk earnestly. That u will improve and be on your A game. That u thank them for the talk. That Important to add \n\n\nAnd if u don't want to do it. Hey, no one wants to do it. People who do this have learned that its a necessity. Some people don't WANT to brush their teeth, by u gotta prevent cavities. Some people will fight tooth and nail not to protect themselves and cover themselves the way hr advices you to, but hey, its just to prevent cavities on the work place.\nBest of luck.\nNever take it personally. This is a reflection on your boss's shit. Not your personality. So remind yourself to not feel down or upset over he words they chose. It was a mistake on THEIR part. U can learn to be better in the ways that desire, but do not for a second take in their judgment and weird behavior as reason to be upset. Cuz u already got shit to deal with. And take it from a third party, your boss lashes some shot out at u passive aggressively. Protect yourself, don't open up about ur weaknesses.

And when we experience trauma sometimes we end up associating certain things, like cigarettes, with bad memories. You are not alone in this, and you can overcome it. Talk back to your fears. Remind them that the cigarettes themselves are not the cause of the trauma. Expose yourself to them in small doses—and I don’t mean go inhale second hand smoke somewhere—but go out to places like a public park, and if you notice someone smoking, don’t immediately leave. See if you can take deep breaths and calm yourself and linger within visual distance for a while. When you feel the anxiety talking to you, try to be in the moment—“I’m at the park. I’m safe. It’s a warm sunny day.” An exercise I’ve always liked is to list things you observe with your five senses—“I see the trees. I hear the birds. I feel the breeze.” Etc.

It sounds very confusing, and like like it would be a hard thing to step back and get perspective on. These kind of rabbit holes we all fall down sometimes can really be miserable. You're certainly not horrible for asking these questions or making this post.\n\nIt sounds like what happened is that your boxing coach box touched you (accidentally, it sounds like) in a way that felt very uncomfortable and got your mind questioning, and you didn't quite how to deal with / process the sudden rush of discomfort, arousal and whatever else started coming from your brain. So your brain's way of dealing with it was to wonder \"oh, does this mean I was molested in the past?\"\n\nI'm not a psychologist or anything, but I'd say that while anything is possible, just with the evidence that you've laid out here it doesn't seem very probable that you were sexually abused in the past and then totally forgot it. Generally that's not how memory works: In most cases, for most people, unless you have a brain injury or heavy drug use - your brain doesn't simply delete memories like they're photos on your phone. Often folks who were sexually abused, especially when young, may not remember all the details. And they may intentionally try to avoid thinking about the unpleasant memory - but a piece of that memory is still accessible. It doesn't sound like that's the case with what you're describing. \n\nI guess the question I'd ask is - do you have any other evidence, aside from how you felt after the boxing coach bumped you, that makes you think you may have been molested? Is there a memory you have of anyone being a little too inappropriate with you? Of contacting you in a way that just didn't seem right, but you couldn't say why it wasn't right?  Are there people or memories in your life that have always made you uncomfortable, but you've never known quite why? \n\nIf nothing comes to mind from the above questions, then my guess would be probably that this uncomfortable physical contact pushed your brain into a panicky spiral for a bit - which, this sort of thing happens a lot as you grow up (when i was a teenager, I thought for a few panicky days I had Parkinson's Disease because I saw my hand shaking and I knew that was a sign of Parkinson's. Later I'd realize that hands shake for a lot of reasons, and Parkinson's only affects people over 50.)", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1748972740.0, "id": "mvt4b41", "author": "tarltontarlton"}

I had learned driving 1.5 years ago at a driving school (20 days × 30 minutes) but didn't really learn shit. I know basics by now, like clutch and brake, but still struggling with things like \n1) better control of steering wheel i.e. keeping the car straight consistently and not moving it fast enough to cross the lane before the other cars arrive. I also struggle at times with knowing how much turn of wheel is required for each turning point. \n2) did terribly at parking (about 6-7 classes) in my parking lot as I was close to crashing the car to the pillar today. At first I turned the car quickly to enter the parking area which had a slight slope, which made the car crooked and almost crashed into the meter box. And today I tried taking it further and slower but it ended up too ahead and when I was going to turn the wheel fully the car was about to collide against a pillar (instructor pulled the handbrake before it could happen). \n3) sometimes I unknowingly let go of accelerator when looking into mirrors or changing lane. Overall I struggle with remembering 100 things and remaining calm at the same time. \n4) I'm finally understanding now whens the correct time to change gears. But when I put from 2nd to 3rd gear after getting speed at 30+, idk how but it gets around 25-26 quickly. \n5) I still made some silly mistakes after having been corrected about it, even though I had been careful most of the time. \n6) Today when my instructor made me change gear from 1st to 2nd on slope I had kept foot on accelerator while doing that and it was a mistake, like he also said, bcoz the car would jerk because of that. But if we don't press accelerator for even a second I was scared the car will fall down. \n7) about 80% of the time my attention is on both rearview mirrors (while keeping focus on all things) but at times the focus goes away and I don't realise there's cars wanting way until either they horn or instructor turns the wheel. When there are crossroads I struggle with keeping calm and decision making if cars keep coming. And sometimes I feel impulsive to just go ahead even if car is coming. \n8) today instructor told me while going through a narrow lane to estimate the space between two pedestrians walking at one side and a car on the other. I kinda failed in that and slightly turned the wheel in a way it was gonna hit the people (instructor turned the wheel quickly though). \n\nI want to be good at driving but I'm slightly losing hope, even if I'm still determined to be a good driver. My instructor was saying that I should've become good at steering by now and that I've still not overcome road fear (Also, I didn't learn two-wheeler before this) and he said that at one point I drive well but some vehicle comes and I panic. He's been mostly nice and patient but he said today that seems like he'll have to scold me from now on as I won't learn otherwise. \n\nI want to know if I'm really slow in this and how I can master car driving?

So when it doesn't come naturally, that's even worse. Ugh. Reading your post brought back all my own memories of learning to drive, and it just floods my system with panic. Everything's happening so fast and it feels like the stakes are so high.\n\nBut honestly, you're actually doing fine. I know it doesn't feel that way, but it's the truth. \n\nDriving is a skill like any other. Some people are faster at picking it up, some people are slower. I don't know who told you that 10 to 15 days was a realistic timeline for learning to drive, but that certainly wasn't my experience (especially if you're learning manual transmission, which it sounds like you are.) I considered myself pretty average when I was learning to drive and it took me months. I did driver's education, i took classes, I went out driving with my parents and friends who had their licenses: I did as much as anyone and it still took months. 10 days is nothing.\n\nAnd even if 10 days were how long it usually takes, so what if you don't get it in 10 days? If you don't get it in 10 days, then you'll probably get it in 20. And if you don't get it in 20, you'll get it in 30.

It's a really stressful time that you're going through, and i think it's something that a lot of guys go through - but because everyone's so worried about being labled as gay and made fun of, no one really talks about. \n\nI'm not an expert in this area by any means, but if you've never been attracted to anyone, I guess it's difficult to say if you're gay or straight, right? I mean gay people are usually attracted to people of the same gender. That's what makes them gay. If you haven't felt that attraction, and the gay porn doesn't do it for you, then probably you're not gay - totally cool if you are, but it just wouldn't seem likely. \n\nAlso - as for the head-on-shoulder giving you a semi: Eh, I don't really think that means too much. I'm guessing you're on the younger side. When you're that age, a lot of things can get a boner started, but it doesn't really mean much. When I was younger sitting on a couch could get me started, but that didn't mean I was attracted to couch cushions. \n\nI can totally understand why you're stressing out about this, but you don't need to. The thing with this stuff is you don't actually have to figure out much at all. It's not a math problem. The answer will just come to you. One day you'll see a girl that gives you feelings, or a guy that gives you feelings - and when you do, well that's you're answer. And if you never meet that person, well then that's your answer too.

Am i in denial? What if thats why i got so numb in the relationship? It can't be because of distance.) Every thought that affects my current stance (me and my relationship) ruins me. But this one is the most stuck one. I always wonder why i've became numb randomly knowing all i wanted to do was love a girl. We've been through a lot and i've did a lot of toxic and weird shit like threatening to leave like a idiot. Now i regret it all and wish i could be better at coping and getting out more. We went too fast i'd say. We already talked about meeting and even notified our parents about it. They weren't as doubting and unsupporting which was surprising. Its been stuck for 2-3 days about whether i'm straight or gay or even bi. I've tried to accept it like yes i'm or bi or whatever as long as i get to love her. I even tried to accept the gay thoughts but it doesn't get better. I've been looking at hocd articles and i no idea if i even have that. When i feel like yes i'm better now the thought always creeps (what if im in denial). I've had same sex experiences when i was younger, some pressured wise, or just some i can't remember why i did. I won't relay a lot because i don't look at it as trauma but it was with my brothers, nasty honesty i was like under the age of 10? Yeah. And another experience was very weird but i won't get into that. I've had thoughts about what if i'm gay or not? It wasn't as crucial i just was like meh, this was throughout life i can say. I can't say specifically because I remember but i don't remember if i liked it or not when i was younger. I sort of forgot about it i didn't really care. When i came for the first time to girls (not relaying what i came to) i got obsessed or something. I jerked off everyday to lesbian porn and such then gradually switched onto heterosexual porn, i didn't really think of being scared of dicks. I just liked two girls going at it. It was my preference. But i've been wanting a lot of sexual encounters (lust) and i've told my girlfriend about them. I'm aware of the hardships yes I understand. The gay thoughts are disturbing, i don't particularly hate gay people and i'm aware i have taste and i even have gay friends pretty sure. I've made homophobic seeming jokes, but I've never rejected them. My mom isn't homophobic, my dad isn't really in my life tbh. Anyways i've had a lot of thoughts i've had panic attacks over and such and only i can know if i'm gay or not and of course i'm not looking for reassurance i just want to hear opinions and replies. I have a therapist appt scheduled next month. It's just these thoughts are uncomfy, i lose my appetite and i kinda have my awareness heightened my mind would purposely try looking at guys and I literally can't imagine anything unless i force it? Like them sucking my dick or something. I want my dick sucked i want sex of course. But i can't think of anyone or anything ive just pondered on about that was the same sex. I've found this guy cool or damn he looks good. I think i have low self esteem or whatever. But i've been less horny and such as well. I tried looking at gay porn and i didn't get hard but i felt a gronial response or whatever i then tried looking at straight porn and it sort of felt the same but a tiny bit better imo (i don't want to fuck some guys ass. Idk if i kinda gagged in my mind when i was watching gay porn or wtv). I felt even more numb after the gay porn shit. I freaked out and had a panic attack on the phone. Why was i so calm?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "MMFB", "title": "Long-distance girlfriend (21F) returning soon but now says she’s unsure about loving me (21M)… I’m completely broken", "text": "\nWe’re a long-distance couple (both 21) from India, and we’ve been together since high school. We’ve been in a relationship for about 2 years now. Things were going really well, even after we started university in different cities. We used to meet every 3–4 weeks and managed long-distance for over 1.5 years without any major issues.\n\nThen she got selected for a student exchange program in Malaysia for one semester (about 5 months). At first, I (21M) was upset — I knew I wouldn’t be able to see her at all during that time. But I accepted it because it was a great opportunity for her (21F), and I genuinely wanted to support her dreams.\n\nIn the beginning, she hated being there. She had no friends and felt really out of place. I was her emotional support — we talked daily and stayed close. Eventually, she made some Indian friends there, started going on trips, and began enjoying herself — and I was genuinely happy for her.\n\nBut the past 8 days have been awful for me. She’s been constantly out on trips, barely talking to me. We used to talk at least an hour a day — now it’s maybe 10 minutes, and even then, it’s just her talking about what she did. When I try to share my side, she seems distracted or uninterested. She even forgets what I said an hour ago.\n\nI started breaking down mentally. I’ve been feeling depressed, anxious, constantly checking my phone for messages or calls from her. I begged her just to spend one day with me. That’s all. Instead, she got frustrated and distant. She said hurtful things like, “Don’t care about me, it’s my life,” and started escaping conversations with excuses.\n\nToday I opened up completely. I poured out how I was feeling — and what I got in return crushed me, “I’m not even sure I love you anymore.”, “I don’t think I enjoy talking to you these days.”, “I’m scared I won’t have this kind of fun once I come back to India.”, “Maybe I need a big break after I return.”\n\nIt hit me hard. I’m an introvert, and she’s more outgoing — but that’s something she used to say she loved about me. I’ve always tried to step out of my comfort zone for her. Now she’s acting like the same qualities she once adored are dealbreakers.\n\nShe’ll be back in 10 days. But she’s already talking about needing “a big break” from us. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so discarded and confused. She says I’m obsessed, but I just wanted a few hours of meaningful time after months apart.\n\nI’ve lost my routine. I feel hopeless. I’m barely talking to anyone and just feel like I’m falling apart.\n\nI could really use some advice on how to process all this and what steps I should take next.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:**  \nWe (21M &amp; 21F) have been in a long-distance relationship for about 1.5 years after dating since high school. She went abroad for a student exchange program, and recently she's been distant — going on trips, barely talking to me, and saying hurtful things. I’m an introvert, she’s outgoing, but now she’s saying she might not love me anymore and wants a break when she gets back. I’m emotionally overwhelmed and don’t know what to do next.

My ferrets Free Run they have a cage but they dominantly have run of thr home with plenty of places to hide. and when I'm not home I also have baby gates blocking half the apartment so they have a space to be away from the dog and the dog has a space to himself as well. I have had my dog for 5 years I have had ferretss longer so he has had ferrets around him most his whole life. He's a shepherd border collie so he does have a tendency of trying to heard them from time to time which gets corrected but he has never once ever tried to actually hurt them. he's snipped at them if they try to steal his toy from him, because honestly my ferrets have always instigated fights with him, but he's usually been very good at walking away or ignoring if i say gentle.  Well anyeay I have had a young ferret who had been sick these last 3 months and has been having a lot of assisted care. I even had him isolated in two-person tent I had set up in my living room to make things easier for him because he was having mobility issues. One of my dogs squeak toys had a specific squeaker that my ferret responded to so we started using it as a form of like physical therapy because he would walk with purpose whenever it was squeaking. Well this day in particular I had taken him out of the tent and we were performinh as the vet called it squeak physical therapy. And he was doing really good he had really good Mobility so I took the path further. somewhere in the chaos out of nowhere my dog came in, I'm sure because of the squeak toy and he was playing with his laser pointer, and in an instant he nipped him. It did leave some bruising but he never punctured he stopped immediately when I grabbed him in no way was he actually being malicious about it. but the bite did result in internal bleeding and before there was anything that could be done about it he ended up passing and I'm devastated. But right now I'm feeling very conflicted. I keep blaming myself. But there's a small part of me that doesn't know how to look at my dog the same now. Knowing that what happened resulted in my ferrets life ending.. specially because he was recovering, it was a slow process but we were making improvements and this was one of the best physical therapy sessions we were in the middle of having before everything went wrong. I don't know how to face myself, its my fault.  but I also don't know how to see him the same way either. My dog is also my whole world!

So things could get awkward, for sure, if you go down that route.\n\nI'm glad you feel a more motivated when you feel connected to her. That's great.

It sounds like you feel really isolated, and that can be killer. \n\nBeing isolated can be really tough because it's like a self-perpetuating cycle.

People would tell me to do this all the time, but it just wasn't quite clicking. One thing that helped me find myself was, oddly, stepping outside of myself and focusing on others. Not in the sense of trying to build relationships, though that at eventually happened, but in the sense that instead of focusing on someone loving me, I just tried to show a loving attitude and actions towards them. If someone needed a ride to the train station, i'd drive them. If someone needed help with homework, I'd help them. I'd check in with people just to make sure they were okay. For whatever reason, doing this sort of thing helped me empty my head of all the negativity and focus on something and someone else for a bit - and when I did come back to myself to reflect, I'd say I had a grater sense of self-worth and self-esteem than I did before.

He was also a total NEET with a drinking problem. We didn't live together, he lived in this decaying hoarder house with his elderly dad, who was the one who found his body. \n\nThe main reason I think it's my fault is because I started to try and set boundaries in my life that I never had before, so I was probably really bad at it. He came over and got blackout drunk one night by stealing a bunch of booze from my roommates, so I got mad at him and told him that I don't want to talk to him anymore when he's drunk. I don't drink anymore because I've been around alcoholics my whole life, so I'm always the one that has to remember the bad stuff that happened while they get to black out and forget everything, and not be ashamed of it. So I told him all this, and I told him he had to pay my roomates back for the booze somehow even if he doesn't have a job.\n\nI was actually really proud of myself for this, because at the time I thought it was a good thing. He did eventually pay back the money for the booze, and I was proud of him for that, and I told him he could come over and hang out anytime as long as he was sober. But I was mad about other stuff too, like how I was always the one asking to hang out and do stuff, so long before this I asked him to be the one doing the asking sometimes. So I didn't say \"please come over, I want to see you,\" I just said \"you can come over anytime you want, I found these two games on Steam I think you'd really like them\". And that was the last thing I ever said to him. \n\nI'm the kind of person who doesn't really care about stuff like birthdays or other holidays, so I don't care if someone forgets my birthday or anniversary or whatever. I definitely do check with people first if it's important to them, so that I make more of an effort to remember and plan things. I knew valentine's day was coming up, and knew it was something he does care about, but I was having a hard time with work and my own problems, and I was still annoyed at him, so I figured if he wanted to do something that day he could at least let me know and I could plan something. But he didn't, so i didn't, and then he killed himself the day before valentine's day. He didn't leave a note, but I know that was something he would have been thinking about. \n\nI'm such an asshole. There were so many other things I could have done, even if I stuck to my boundary of not hanging out when he was drunk. I could have at least gotten him some shitty valentines card. I could have said \"I'm worried about you, please can I just see you?\" I could have talked more to his dad about us both asking him to go inpatient. I could have just had sex anyway and cuddled him more. I could have helped him more trying to clean out the hoarder house. I should have done all this stuff, but I was too busy being annoyed. And now I'd give ANYTHING just to see him again. \n\nIdk why I'm even posting this, because people will reply and be very kind and say \"it's not your fault,\" and I'll say \"I know, thank you,\" because what else can you say really? The past is the past, and I can't go back and change anything, so thinking about it is pointless. I'm just so tired and stressed out that it's hard to keep trying to think that. Idk what I need, but I guess typing this is probably good, even though it just made me feel worse. Might as well throw it out into the void.

It doesn't come in stages, but rather its a mixture of it all in various waves. \n\nI think typing this sort of thing out is therapeutic, and I'd encourage you to keep doing it on days/times you can't get thoughts out of your head. \n\nAs for the last thing you said to him, \"you can come over anytime you want, I found these two games on Steam I think you'd really like them\" - it sounds like you were kind, thoughtful and inviting. \n\nAll of your feelings in this are valid. It does sound frustrating as hell. It's tough when you love someone and they're struggling. It sounds like a strained relationship with lots of complications from other factors. \n\nFrom all of the things you said, you are not an asshole. I'm proud you set boundaries. That wasn't a problem. And doing more in the past may not have been a factor that didn't lead to the same outcome. He was clearly struggling.\n\nAs for medications being a trying factor to drive people to give more energy to kill themselves, this is in no way tied to you being a driving factor. You could argue that you NOT getting him to go on medications led him to do it. So that's a moot point. It's not up to you or the past decisions you made for what happened. It very much may have been unavoidable, and you can't blame yourself, it's just self-harm to think that way. \n\nI would encourage you to see if you can reduce your work stress. Engage in some extra self-care, whether this be treating yourself to something positive, a small indulgence, an edible treat, a good game or book, time with family/friends, whatever makes you feel better. Can you take a vacation day or two? You don't need to go anywhere to take some time off.\n\nI don't know what else to say, but I'm sorry you're dealing with this. If you haven't yet, I sometimes find talking to chatgpt therapeutic, no joke. And it can be helpful to draw inspiration from it to give you ideas on how to feel better during times of grief.

It was a very good friendship last year but then, starting in January this year, things went south and we had many arguments over small things, which spiralled into big arguments. Shortly after one ended, another one began etc. I won’t go into the details of them here because they’re not really relevant to my question and they’re long stories.\n\nEventually, we both just stopped communicating. I stopped replying to her first and then shortly after she stopped texting me. Last time, we texted was a month week ago. We both went to a college event a couple of weeks ago and were at the same table, yet we didn’t really speak. We haven't met up recently and she's had meetups with other friends. So it’s safe to say the friendship is pretty much over sadly.\n\nThing is, I believe she was mostly at fault with this friendship ending. She was mostly responsible for these little problems turning into big arguments. She was very hostile and constantly personally attacked me. She was very hypocritical and held me to a different standard than she did herself. Acting the victim if I ever tried to stand up for myself. She was horrible to me. During our arguments, I bit my tongue a lot and held back many times. A lot of times I should’ve stood up for myself and told her she was wrong, I didn’t. I was a people pleaser and I didn’t want the friendship to end so I often pretended everything was fine when it wasn’t. A lot of times she hurt me, I didn’t say anything.\n\nNow that the friendship is over, I'm not as sad as I thought I would be. I am mostly relieved. But I wish I had stood up for myself more. I know many of you will say \"but she wouldn't have cared anyway!!\" More so, for my own piece of mind, I wish I had. There's stuff I needed to get off my chest that I didn't and I'm struggling to get over it. I obviously can't message her out of the blue saying it, because that would be completely unhinged.\n\nShe is a gossip and I know she's twisting this to her other friends to make me the bad guy, I know she did that at least once in the past and I bet she's doing it now. It's frustrating she's damaging my character in the eyes of people who I was once quite friendly with, and I don't have any opportunity to challenge it. It's frustrating that she comes out of this with a decent group of friends and I don't really have anyone.

It's a lot to bear, everything at once - and I totally get how it can feel like the sky is falling on you. I would feel the same way too. \n\nBut I've sometimes found that if you look at your issues one by one, you can see individual solutions -and once you see the solutions adding up, everything feels a little better.\n\nSo here's just what I'd say to you issue-by-issue:\n\n\\- Depression. Yeah, that sucks for sure. Definitely not fun. But you're obviously a pretty strong, smart, together dude if you can get through grad school. So you can and will manage this as well as anyone can. And lots of people with depression are in relationships.\n\n\\- On being loved again: Well, i mean not knowing anything else about you, I'd just say that the fact that you got out of a relationship suggests to me that you can get into another one when the time is right. It's tough to find the right person of course. But if the last woman liked you, there are probably other women out there who will like you.\n\n\\- Friends: If your friends like you, which they probably do, then that relationship can't be sabotaged. It sounds like you're low-key trying to say that you don't think your friends like you, and don't want to hang around you (so they can be easily peeled away by a few lies) - and that sounds like something that your depression is saying more than you're saying.\n\n\\- Hair + Weight: Yeah, this kinda sucks as well. It's real. As a middle aged dude myself, this happens: the pounds come and the hair starts to leave. But like, this happens to everyone unfortunately. The guy over 30 who's not losing a little hair is the exception rather than the rule. Same thing with the gray. Weight you can control. Again, you're obviously smart and disciplined so you can get it in check. The hair is a little iffy, but also less important. In my experience with women, especially women over 30, as long as you do what you can to look your best - grooming, etc.etc. the hair stuff is relatively unimportant. \n\n\\- Living with Parents: You're living with them during grad school, and you're not dating during grad school - so I don't think this really takes you down in the eyes of women if that's what you're worried about, right?", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1744125643.0, "id": "mm1q3oq", "author": "tarltontarlton"}

I ended up in the psych unit multiple times and then my mom ran off with a guy younger than me. She hasn’t spoken to me since. I have PCOS and can’t lose weight no matter how hard I try. I’m also extremely ugly. (I posted on r/amiugly and people confirmed besides my weight it’s my bone structure and bad genes, which I can’t fix). I have crippling social anxiety. No amount of therapy has helped. I’ve never had a guy show interest in me and haven’t had a single friend since Elementary School. I tried meetups, dating sites, groups for young adults with autism with no luck. No one wants to be friends with someone as socially awkward and ugly as me. Never been on a vacation, amusement park, circus, etc. Parents never liked to go places. I also found a mass and it might be cancer. The doctors don’t seem to care and keep dragging their feet with the appointments. I’m so scared I’m going to die without getting to experience a good life. \n\nNothing bad ever seems to happen to nasty people.

All my pets have died in horrific, traumatizing ways.  \n\nThe wife even told me she never met anyone as unlucky as me. I had more losses or bad things happen than anyone else there.

He was a yr younger.  We were head over heels and it was a very sweet relationship.  He treated me like I mattered and was loved.  The only person in my life (going forward to do this).  He was in the military and had to go overseas but we made plans for me to come over halfway through. Only I messed up and had a fling for 1 night 3 weeks before, with his best friend.   I still carry guilt 30 yrs later. Like horrible, u repressed guilt.  He was told almost immediately. He forgave his best friend.  \n\n6 months later he comes home and tells me that he got a girl pregnant and he was going to marry her but wasn't in love with her but it was the right thing to do. \n\nThat got put on the back burner and we still saw each other and would date randomly and hook up of course, off and on, before I ended up moving and getting married. Immediately regretted getting married, &amp; only did so because he refused to commit to relationship. 2 yrs later when I moved back, we had talked about getting back together.  Then he tells me he got married.  Wtf? \n\nAs the years passed he would initiate contact 90% of the time with me anywhere from every couple of months, every couple of weeks to even a year or two in between. Now depending on where we were in the world, or in our lives, we would either talk for a few emails or on the phone or even meet in person. Or email back and forth for a year.  I never personally cheated on any of my spouses but I felt validation when I became the other woman to his spouse because in my eyes I didn't like her.  We became sounding boards for each other. He was very unhappy in his marriage. I was unhappy in my second marriage and was in an abusive relationship.\n\nI guess this is my payback for what I did. I never fell out of love with this guy. He was everything I always wanted. But it was always talking and flirting for however long then meeting up and hooking up and then we would just go on with our lives for however long. But it was always so sweet and it meant a lot to me at the time every single time. \n\nI thought in my mind that this meant something for both of us. Why else would he initiate contact after almost 30 years as often as he did? We had intense chemistry even after all of this time. \n\nI ended up in a very dark place for a couple of years. I'm not proud of it but I'm proud of what I came through. I ended up on drugs lost everything I had and even had a false charge against me to where I ended up going to prison for something that I did not do in the courts knew I didn't do it but I still went for not paying it fine. And I was so ashamed of this. But since I got out I have busted my ass and done everything on my own with no one's help but my own.  that I have no family I have nobody to support me but me.  \n\n\nLast year I ended a relationship that was second only to mine with this guy. But when I saw him again, it was different, he was different. He was lying to me, he was standing me up,  and the pain was real. He was an ass to be honest. I was doing everything I can to get his attention, and it just was hooking up and that was it. \n\nI'd spoken to him a few weeks ago and he had told me he had been sick and in and out of the hospital. I'd mentioned I'd been sick at the same time too. And we would send a message or two back and forth every few days. I just thought he was being an ass. But apparently he was back in the hospital again. During this time I find out later everybody was coming to see him he was wanting people to come and see him I had even asked and he said no to me.  \n\n\nI get a message on this past Wednesday that he had been flown to a hospital two and a half hours away in critical condition. So I go down there a few days ago and see him and I just lose it. This is the person I envisioned one day having a life with. And seeing him it absolutely broke my heart &amp; his family was consoling me. His friends were consoling me and I felt guilty for this because I it should have been the other way around. \n\nHis prognosis is not good, actually poor,  but I was told that he's responding and he was,  he made the motion for me to stop crying. \n\nWhile talking to his family, his mom mentioned that this one girl was going to show up and it didn't phase me,  I wasn't paying attention. Turns out it was his \"off and on\"  person for the past 10 years and she asked if I knew about her. I'd never heard of this person in my life. And I made some kind of smart ass comment well I'm the off and on for 30. That kind of grabbed everybody's attention. I don't know why I said that. But apparently no one else knew about me. Except his sister.  And it hit me tonight. I was just a side hook up that's it .\n\nI meant absolutely zilch. Nothing. He couldn't bring me around his family his friends. Like he could this other person, even while he was still married. I was just a side piece for 30 flipping years. And nobody knew and I opened my mouth. I was introduced as a lifelong friend.  \n\nI feel so damn selfish that I'm sitting here feeling sorry for myself as he's laying in a hospital bed fighting for his life. I realized I didn't know that part of his life and wasn't a part of his life. He kept that separate on purpose. I was an embarrassment because of what I'd been through. He didn't want me around his friends and family. Even though they, some of them, knew me.  A couple people even commented on \"oh! so you're xxx!\". And they promised me it was good. B******* .\n\nHis sister sent me a message that essentially I felt like was thanks for coming up, don't come back. I had planned on coming back tomorrow. And I'm thinking why?

I remember being younger and feeling that I was \"behind\" everyone, and that because I couldn't seem to \"catch up\" and be like them, I was in some way broken and unloveable. \n\nI think it's natural to see your life in terms of a competition. A lot of life is like that. And I think humans are a naturally competitive species. But it's also just not correct. Being social in a way that makes you happy, and connecting with others, is a problem that everyone solves in their own way. Solutions that work for your new friend don't work for you, and visa versa. And everyone figures out their own solution along a different timeline. Some people figure it out instantly, others take time. Almost everyone who tries will figure it out. I don't know of anyone who wants to figure it out who hasn't eventually figured it out. \n\nAnd clearly you want to figure it out. Of course it hurts to see other people seeming to enjoy a solution that you can't get yet. But here's the thing: That's just an illusion. Because you were never going to have the same solution as them because you are a different person. It's like being jealous of someone who has lots of nice things because their dad is a billionaire: Sure, that's great, but you weren't born rich, so how could you really feel bad?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "MMFB", "title": "I got super scammed by someone who was supposed to be my friend", "text": "Ok, this might get a little messy. I’m not super good at sorting the chronological order of events that went on, and it’s still an incredibly anger inducing story for me. I’ve been in contact with several people about the situation (government agencies police etc) and none of them are interested, and at this point it’s pretty much scream into a pillow or post on Reddit. My pillow is all out of space for screams so here I am.\n\nI worked in a casino for a few years, reception job - easily the best job to have in a casino. I got very friendly with a lot of very wealthy people over the time I worked there. There was one guy who for the purpose of this story I will call Leon (meaning lion, his real name also means lion) who had a ‘wife’ that we will call Zara.\n\nLeon and Zara would come in semi often but not really gamble, just sit at the bar and drink, fine by me as they paid their bill and seemed nice enough, one day Leon comes in alone (weird) holding a letter from the police (extra weird) and looking incredibly upset, I went up to take a break in the back of the casino and passed him on the way, just sort of sitting at the bar zoning out looking like he might make some kind of terrible decision, so I walked up to him, cracked a few jokes and asked if he was ok, he said yes so I left him be and went for a smoke.\n\nLater I find out (in casinos everybody talks constantly, you cannot have secrets from us) that Leon had caught his wife cheating on him in the park with this random guy and was, as you can imagine, heartbroken. My heart goes out to him because I am an overly naive person (been trying to work on that), we have another conversation which is something along the lines of ‘hey, I know it sucks super hard right now but you will be ok eventually’ and we leave it at that. Leon owns and manages a ‘hedge fund asset management type affair’ (obviously I know nothing about finance)\n\nHe told me the police letter was because he had been arrested for assault after fighting the guy he caught Zara cheating with\n\nHe later finds me on instagram - I have a pretty unusually spelled name so it wasn’t super hard - and asks me, platonically, out for a drink. I feel super bad for the guy because of his situation and decide I can’t let him drink alone so yeah why not? Right? I can speak to him a bit, maybe make him feel a bit better and whatever.\n\nCasinos have a very strict anti fraternisation policy when it comes to guests.\n\nThis was of course my own fault. I knew I wasn’t supposed to go but decided to anyway, fast forward about a week or so and I get called to my managers office who brings up CCTV of me walking past another casino the company owns with Leon, I don’t try to deny it of course and tell him we grabbed a couple of drinks because he was feeling pretty down and, whilst knowing I’m not supposed to, I do still have empathy for the people I meet on a regular basis. He essentially tells me it’s ok but not to do it again which is fair enough. \n\nNow is the fucked up part.\n\nI knew I would have the meeting with the manager a few days before it happened and felt pretty nervous, I end up messaging Leon and telling him that if anyone asks him, there is no need to lie. They have the proof so just tell the truth so he won’t get blacklisted from the casino, and if I get fired I will just have to find another job, I made my bed and I’ll lie in it.\nLeon tells me that he actually really needs a personal assistant. If I would be willing to work for him then he’d be happy to hire me at a pretty good pay rise, I of course am a little distrusting but we’ve made a pretty good friendship to this point (without any expectations) so I tell him it’s really not necessary but he insists, I end up taking the job, get a contract sent through and signed, take an aptitude test and fill out all of the usual forms you would associate with starting a new job.\n\nEverything online checks out, he has a pretty good website with a directors list, the firm is listed on Bloomberg and with the uk business directory, there’s multiple news releases of big investments that the company has made into other companies and Leon has a driver so that he doesn’t need to focus on driving himself places and can work from the back of the car.\n\nAs I begin to work for him, suddenly every day is hectic, I can handle it. But it feels like there’s always a fire to put out. As I said, I don’t know much about finance, right? I’m supposed to be there as an assistant to make appointments and write up meeting minutes and be some kind of emotional crutch to a man who’s just lost everything, but things start to get strange and I stop being so trusting of him.\n\nMy first pay date is end of June, nothing. I call him and ask what’s happened as I can’t afford now to pay my rent, he blames it entirely on the payment provider we’re going through (Wagestream and ADP), he’s forwarding me the emails from them that say that they fucked up, he’s calling them for me, so I assume he’s being truthful and something happened in the backend somewhere, I guess mistakes happen.\n\nMy birthday is July 1, he asked me not to make any plans for it as we would have to go on a really important trip that weekend so I did as asked. On Friday we were supposed to go at 11am, he comes to pick me up.. I put my luggage in the back of the car and he got a phone call, he said he had to go for 40 minutes to quickly sort out an emergency and then would come back to pick me up and we would go to the airport.\nI was still in my house 8 hours later, without my luggage and not knowing what was going on, all my calls going to voicemail, crying and smoking cigarettes on my balcony.\n\nI end up going to Spain for my birthday to see my mother, she lends me the money to pay my rent and Leon buys me a ticket to come back to London because he ‘really needs his assistant to be back around because he has so much on’, we’re closing a deal with a really big property developer who was introduced to him through a very dear friend of mine.\n\nA few more crazy things happened within this time that I really can’t be bothered to get in to \nBut namely, fights with Zara, arguing with her over twitter dms etc\n\nThe deal kept getting pushed back and pushed back and there were a lot of problems involved, he was supposed to be financing it and sent the proof of payment as well as forwarding several emails from the banks who are supposed to be confirming the money is sent and it looks like everything is good and it’s all happening \n\nThen my dear friend calls me and asks me ‘what the fuck have you two been doing’\n\nUpon switching the call to FaceTime and seeing the shock on my face, my friend calms and realises I have had wool pulled over my eyes, he tells me that all of the emails are fake. They’re fraudulent as well as a donation Leon had made to a charity for a pretty large amount (he faked the transfer document) \n\nI did not get paid for July either (this is now two months of not getting paid) \n\nI called his driver to let him know that I didn’t think he would get paid, he had also been swayed by Leon’s convincing scam and assured me that couldn’t be the case for several reasons \n\nI stopped talking to Leon or going to work and started to liaise directly with HR to tell them I just wanted the money I was owed (that I in turn owe to my mother, otherwise I’d be homeless) and they assure me they’ll draw up paperwork meaning I can’t sue and pay me the money \n\nThey do neither of those things \n\nThe driver calls me back, he did not get paid, worse still, Leon logged onto the other drivers phone pretending he needed to make a phone call and managed to transfer himself £50,000 from the drivers mobile banking app.\n\nI start to get in contact with all of the CEO’s of the companies I initially saw the press releases from, it turns out he’s done exactly the same thing to all of them, promising large amounts of money and pretending to have sent it when actually he hasn’t, and all of the documents are forged.\n\nIn this time he had given me a list of fake addresses (one of which was the address of one of the CEO’s I ended up contacting), a lot of fake stories (he apparently went to a prestigious college in the USA which I now doubt) he has a bunch of certifications on his LinkedIn, I went through the register for each one and he appears on none of them.\n\nSo the whole thing is basically fake.\n\nI have no idea why, what he gains from it, or how the FCA have allowed him to get away with it. If anybody has literally any insight at all please do let me know, he legally owes me £17,000 (I won a tribunal and he still hasn’t paid me) and god knows how much to other people, it’s honestly the craziest thing that’s ever happened to me and it’s been almost a year and I still wake up crying sometimes, I honestly wish I had never tried to help him in the first place (emotionally) and I’ve now been forced to give up my whole life and move in with my mother just to try to financially recover a little\n\nTLDR: my ‘friend’ asked me to work for him and then plunged me into the weirdest scam Ive ever seen in my entire life \n\n ", "score": 5, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1743715967.0, "id": "1jqux17", "author": "yodaddyabitch", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1jqux17/i_got_super_scammed_by_someone_who_was_supposed/"}

And a lot more common than maybe you think. I've been there myself and that pain will just rip your chest apart. You're not bad or stupid or lame or deformed for having these issues. Most guys have them. Most guys overcome them. You will overcome them too.\n\nI want to try to answer your question about how to \"flirt with and date women\" as best I can. But before I start I just want to say that I think you might (totally understandably) be focusing on the wrong thing. You're putting the cart before the horse in a way, i think. A lot of guys do. The first building block you need is really simple: You just need to be able to start and maintain conversations with women are or might be interested in. That's it. That's the game. Focus on that. \n\nSo instead of seeing a woman and saying \"how can I successfully flirt with her?\" or \"how can I date her?\", just ask yourself \"how can I start a conversation with her?\" That's the key to everything and I think you understand that, because you recognize that your bro-in-law's secret sauce is that he can talk to anyone. That's it, just talking.\n\nAnd you have all the pieces for a great conversation for almost everyone in your head already. You just struggle to get it out. I think that's because you're overthinking it, and trying to find the \"correct\" answer. Say you work at a pizza shop and you want to talk to a female co-worker: Just share a true thought you have about the pizza shop, like \"why don't we have sardines?\", \"our boss is being a dick today,\" or \"that weird guy called again\" - just share a thought, listen to what she says in response, then share another thought. That's it. You're talking. Once you're talking, everything else comes from that - flirting, whatever. All that happens once you're talking. \n\nThe other thought I'd share, not sure if this applies to you, is that this game is really IRL. I know a lot of guys want to meet someone online because it seems easier and they already spend a lot of time online, but in my experience the chances of starting a good conversation online with a woman is like .000002%. There's a lot of things working against it. IRL you chances might be just 2% - but that's still a lot more.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1743601529.0, "id": "ml0t3up", "author": "tarltontarlton"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "MMFB", "title": "Should i (23M) give my gf (23F) space after she’s asked for it?", "text": "\n\nI’ll try to keep it short as I can but I want to give as much detail so I can have proper feedback. I (23M) and my gf (23F) have been together for 1 year. It’s been poetic to say the least, from both sides. She is lovely, very kind and compassionate, very loving to myself and my son. Gets along swimmingly with my family and hers with me as well. We have never yelled at each other, we are wonderful communicators and always solve the problems together. I can confidently say up until recent we had no true issues. \n\nAbout 5 weeks ago, I found out an incident that had happened with a coworker of ours that happened much before we had met. Maybe 2 years ago, give or take (Just to clarify, they never slept together only 2 dates and he pursued her for about a year while married, ending in his wife divorcing him). While it’s not a huge deal to me and Im not one to judge anyone’s past, I had specifically asked upwards of 7-8 times if anything had ever happened concerning this specific coworker. I didn’t care of feel threatened but ever since he found out her and I were together his attitude towards me did a complete 180. We went from friendly and talkative.. to short, pointed and very odd remarks about my gf. \n\nThis threw me off an I had specifically asked about this behavior and if there is anyway she could help me understand the sudden change. She never alluded to this issue and was adamant that nothing ever happened. Well turns out another person had their suspicions of something that had happened and finally I pressed her a little further as my gut was telling me that wasn’t the full truth. It turns out that all it was and like I said I couldn’t care less, but it really dampened the trust I had built in her. \n\nI decided to break it off then and let sleeping dogs lie. Up until this point I have never had anxiety attacks or knots outside of drinking too much coffee. But that night I felt sick, like I had taken it too far and that I was seriously walking away from something that is repairable. I brushed it off and didn’t reach out. She pursued me unwaveringly for 3-4 days and even broke down at work multiple times because of it. Finally she met me after work 4 weekends ago (roughly 4-5 days after this event) and gives me a very long letter. In this letter I was blown away by  everything she thought. She held nothing back and never did anything but admit wrong doing and never made an excuse for her actions. \n\nOn top of my truly believing to my core that I had made a mistake and praying about it, I decided to slowly take steps to reconciliation. Everything was great, she kept true to all her commitment and promises and truly opened up more about everything I could possibly find out or that may hurt me in the future (nothing I didn’t already know). This lasted and was great but everyday I was questioning her silently, I wouldn’t say anything other than I slowly realized I still didn’t trust her. I didn’t fully believe everything she said and always felt like I was looking and searching for an out or to be right. Finally I pulled the trigger last night after we agreed to spend today with each other and head into work Saturday from my home. \n\nOnce I sent the text, I was very polite but to the point that my lack of trust in her was wavering and that I didn’t think I could do this with her but I still did very much love her. About 35 minutes later she started to frantically call me and asked to come in and that she was at my house. I let her in and we were very quiet for a while until the silence grew painful. She asked and begged me to ‘jump’ for her and to let her show me that everything she said was true and pure. While I truly love her I was hesitant to take that huge leap of faith after I already had and it had been broken. After a few hours of very respectful talking and communication, we agreed that we jump together. I agreed not to attempt to leave again just because I’m still hurting and she agreed to be transparent and honest and help rebuild. She then spent the night and planned to go home in the morning, pack a bag and continue our plans. This would have taken a total of 2 hours max. \n\nWhen she got home she went AWOL, absolute silence. Then sends me a very shocking text that she’s very in love with me and that she loves us but doesn’t like the cycle of rinse and repeat we seem to be starting. I ask to meet and she agrees, it turns out when she made it home her sister sat her down and told her that they are concerned because of her frantic and late departure three times to my home in the past month to make sure we didn’t split up. \n\nWhen we met she explained that she needed space and that she wanted to be able to breathe and that she feels as if she’s begging me to love and trust her. We have polar opposite responses to this specific issue, hers being to cling tighter and mine being to walk away fairly quickly and without warning. I understand that I’ve also made the mistake of giving her no reason to trust that I won’t walk away again. After promising the first time I won’t, doing it abruptly one night and then agreeing again that I’d take that leap of faith with her once more.\n\nThe part I need advice on:\nShe asked for space, not a break or to break up but just space from each other for a bit. She asked to keep our locations on, we set ground rules to stay exclusive and trust that our loyalty will not waver in the time being. She agreed we will keep up some sense of normalcy, such as being our normal selves at work, occasional texting and checking in and maybe spending a few hours a week eating out or going to the park. She wasn’t very specific on a timeframe but did say she thinks it’s best we take anywhere from 2-6 weeks to both determine our best relationship-repair tools and tactics then resume us and put an end to this cycle. I agreed, not very willingly and have again turned into a slight ball of anxiety. She’s never given me a reason to doubt her loyalty only her trust. But asked that for at least the first 48 hours refrain from texting and both just relax and breathe. \n\nIn my mind I don’t necessarily see this as super healthy as communication in solving the issue together is the common goal, not ignoring the problem and each other. I also think we both have cracks in the foundation of trust for different reasons that this break may not fix.\n\nAm I wrong in believing that we maybe signing the relationships death warrant?\n\n\nI also at least plan on waiting until first contact to communicate to her but thought that similarly writing a letter conveying all my thoughts, feelings and strategies would be optimal so that she understands this is not one sided and that I want this at bad as she does.\n\nDoes this sound like a poor idea?\n\n\nI did at one point ask for space after the initial break up and that was the 3-4 days I mentioned earlier, to which she sadly agreed to. When I reinitiated contact and brought some normalcy back into our lives, that’s when she gave me the letter she had wrote the first day of the break up.\n\nShould I wait out the silence and give her the space she wants? \nShould I make one last stand and effort to form healthy repair strategies with her and keep moving forward?\nShould I quietly or verbally let this relationship go? \n\nTo reiterate, even now I don’t doubt the love and choice of daily love we have for each other. She was very emotional asking for time and seemed to be hurting bad when starting the conversation but also seemed extremely optimistic that this was going to be good for us and that us proving to each other that I can trust her word and she can trust my commitment, we will flourish. She also agreed with my sentiment that this wasn’t enough to fix the issue but a start. But I do have a slight feeling that while her emotions were all genuine, the ‘fix’ to our issues was regurgitated and not actually her own personal wants. It seemed very against our entire relationship up until this point and the way we solve our issues.\n\nSorry for the length of this, thank you in advance for all the replies and feedback!", "score": 3, "num_comments": 12, "created_utc": 1743220346.0, "id": "1jmdvl7", "author": "Glum_Pollution_9839", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1jmdvl7/should_i_23m_give_my_gf_23f_space_after_shes/"}

After college, we became close with two other girls and that that has been our group for a couple of years. She became a teacher about 3 years ago and became friends with other people and hangout and go on trips with them which I totally get! Yet we started noticing she would always go on the trips and never invite and when I asked her about it in playful way she just responded “ well I don’t make the plans”. When it came to our group making trying or hanging out she would be very hesitant to go or not go at all. It was becoming distance and awkward. About a year ago, we talked to her about the situation and how we were feeling and asking if she was okay. She broke out crying explaining she has a lot going on at home and feels overwhelmed. ( her mom has been sick for years which I get that is scary) yet my friend pointed out that we thought she was okay because we would still see her go out and post with her other friends. After that things seemed to get better but became awkward again. \nLast week, she messaged the group chat on a day we were all supposed to hang out but she said she couldn’t due to work.

If she really doesn't like you all any more, you can't force her to like you, you have to just let her be herself.  If she eventually comes back to you, great - if by then you still want her to.

It's just all so painful, and it makes me feel so helpless and dark. It feels like the world is spinning out of control and there's nothing I can do about it.\n\nBut I have found a couple things that have helped me:\n\n\\- **Stop getting news from social media.** This is a tough one, but it's really helped me. I try to read 10 or so minutes a day of actual news from an actual news source  (or sources) I trust. (For me it's the generally the New York Times, or the Guardian, etc. etc. Everyone has a different source.) Then that's it. That's all the news I consume. I try to avoid all news / current events topics on IG or other social platforms, just because it's just too much. Getting my news from the web and my cat / cooking videos on social helps me keep things separate, and maintain my sanity.\n\n\\- **Taking positive steps to make the world a better place.**  You can't fix the world. You can't stop what's happening in Palestine, or with climate change, etc. etc. But you can make a difference in important issues. When I get overwhelmed by the firehose of awful news, I try to balance myself out by going to a protest, donating to a foodbank or just picking up a bag of trash from the side of the road.

But I find that if news overwhelms me, doing something, anything, to change what's going on - no matter how small - is like a little bit of anti-doom in my soul.\n\nHang in there.

They try to make you think you're a bad person if you don't do what they want you to do, and I believe that's wrong and harmful to our mental health.  You can acknowledge that something is a problem while also acknowledging that fixing it isn't something that you can do.\n\nOne of the things I do to see if a line of thought really makes sense, is to try applying it to other situations.  Suppose I break my arm.  Should I refuse to treat my arm because my mother had cancer?  Of course not.  Am I privileged because I only have a broken arm, while she had cancer?  In a twisted way, perhaps, sort of, kind of - but not in any useful way.  Am I selfish because I want my arm to heal, while she died of her cancer?  Should I make sure it stays broken and doesn't heal properly, since she died of her cancer?  Of course not.  I can still both feel sad for her and worry about my arm, but if reading stories about other people dying of cancer depresses me, and my reading the stories doesn't help those other people or my mother in any way, why shouldn't I stop reading the stories and concentrate on me, and my memories of her?\n\nPeople who try to trick and bully you into being involved in their issues aren't doing you any favors.  They don't care about you, they only care about their issues.  You need to take care of your own mental health, and if that means reducing your involvement in others' issues, well, that's life.

They were a part of a subculture in my country that doesn't have an equivalent in any other country as far as I know, but the closet thing I could think of is probably dumb Frat Bros.\n\nMe and my guy friends started riffing and making jokes as we usually do, and one of the frat bros eventually listened to our conversation and tried to join in on the joke, and at first we sort of welcomed him into the bit, because we thought he was just a funny, well-meaning guy, so he kind of found his way into our conversation. Meanwhile, the girls to our right, who were also our friends but kind of on another wavelength told us to be quiet, and one of the girls at the table to my right caught the frat bro's eye and he recognized her from middle school and started just screaming her name and annoying her.\n\nHe just kept shouting her name like he was catcalling her and wouldn't stop, and at some point he tried to sit next to me while he was doing it and I tried giving him a little kick or a nudge so he'll take the hint and I even told him kind of quietly \"hey, stop that dude\", in a very relaxed tone so he wouldn't feel \"threatened\" but it didn't matter, he just kept shouting out her name.\n\nEventually, the guy group left and stayed with the girls because I had a class with them, but this guy kept on harassing this girl.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "Hey there. Really really sorry that you're going through this. I know the feeling well: I've been fired / laid off / whatever you want to call it several times over the course of my career. It's not fun. Obviously the financial hit, and the anxiety that comes from that, is probably the biggest source of stress and anxiety from this sort of thing happening. But I've also found that the hit to my social circle - I realized only too late that the people I thought of as my \"friends\", my social circle - were actually just my colleagues, and when i didn't have that job anymore, I didn't really have a social group. That was tough. And even bigger than that I would say was the damage to my pride and self-image. Both times I got fired, just the humiliation of being told that you're not worth it, and being walked out of the building - man, that really makes you feel worthless. For a bit anyway. So that's all what might be coming for you in a few days.\n\nBut the good part is that both times I've been let go, it ended up being an incredible time of growth for me - and much sooner than I would have guessed, not only was I back on my feet, I was like 100% better off than I was before. No question. \n\nThe first time I got let go, I had just really felt stuck in my job. I didn't like it. I knew there was this other field that I wanted to be in, and I was trying to get into it - but it was just not clicking - and I was miserable. Then they let me go and suddenly I was free. I was able to let go of where I was, and really focus on where I wanted to be. I explored opportunities that I hadn't been open to previously. It was really eye-opening and invigorating, suddenly having to see and navigate things in a new way. I jumped jobs a lot those next couple years whereas before, when I was hanging on at the old place that fired me, I was just so afraid of instability that I was kind of paralyzed. But now I could move forward, and like 18 months later (or so, maybe less- probably less), I'd landed my dream job in the new field I'd really wanted to be in. Beyond my dream job actually. I never could have imagined I would have gotten that job when I was still hanging on a the old place. My only regret about it all was that they didn't fire me sooner, actually. I look back on how much time I hung on at the old place, before they fired me, and I think now \"shit, I could have been doing so much more so much sooner.\"\n\nFast-forward a couple years. I'm working in the field I love, at a company I like, doing what i like at a decently high-level, surrounded by people I like. Livin' the dream. Buuuut, it's slowly killing me. The hours are long and getting longer. The pressure and politics are ramping up. And I have a new baby at home who I see for like 20 minutes a day because I'm working so much. But I can't make the change myself. I can't just quit. I'm not having luck finding anything else. And every other job of that kind would honestly probably be much the same. Then out of nowhere the company hits the skids and I get laid off. It was super stressful and scary as it always is. But just like before, it turned out better than I could have expected. Like, because I was free I was able to ask myself \"do I still want to live where I'm living?\" (it never would  have occurred to me to ask that before, as I had to live where I was living for my job) - the answer was no. And so my family re-located, and it was a major change but so so much better: I got to work from home, which was a total gamechanger for me. I spent way more time with my kid. I got to be near my parents as they got older. That's the sort of stuff money just can't buy. \n\nPoint is this: Yes, getting fired sucks. But it every time it's happened to me, it's been the prelude to something much, much better - something I couldn't have even imagined before I got fired. I don't know if that's that way for everyone. But I know the process isn't as dark as it seems.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1740852679.0, "id": "mfgvmk8", "author": "tarltontarlton"}

My original post didn't get a lot of attention so I doubt there were too many on the edge of their seat for an update to this!! But I decided to update as a reminder that somethings work out well in the end, even better than you could've expected. :)\n\nOriginal post is here for those curious: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1huccq2/really\\_regret\\_my\\_choice\\_for\\_my\\_college\\_work/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1huccq2/really_regret_my_choice_for_my_college_work/)\n\nSo shortly after I made the post, I messaged my work placement co-ordinator saying I didn't want to do Company Y anymore, basically saying what I said in my post. I had already signed the contract, so I know it was shitty of me to do so, but I realised how stupid my decision was. She was very understanding and kind despite the fact that this was all my fault. She said I didn't have to stay with Company Y if I really didn't want to and the Head of Department approved this as well. My co-ordinator contacted Company X asking if I could go back to them for my placement. She also contacted Company Y letting them know I wasn't going.\n\nLuckily, Company X agreed to take me back, despite the fact that they're already taking on another student. All this happened the week before placement was due to begin. I went back to Company X and I've been there almost seven weeks so far. I am enjoying it and find it much better than I did last summer, as I'm quite used to the work there at this point. I appreciate it a lot more when I realised it was the better option.\n\nI know I got very lucky here, that my college was ok with this and that Company X agreed to take me back, and I'm very thankful to these people (co-ordinator, head of department and company X people). I felt tremendous guilt (and I still do) about cancelling on Y after I signed the contract, and I know I may have damaged future students chances of getting a placement there. I think things worked out as well as they could have given the situation I was in and I'm very glad I switched back to Company X.\n\nAlso, another good result out of this whole situation, is that I have *finally* started learning how to drive!! I've been putting it off for years and this made me realise I need to learn, it's ridiculous I left it this long. Straight away, I registered to get my learner's permit and did the eye test and signed up for lessons. So far, I've done four lessons and aim to pass my test later this year. I'm looking at cars and am planning to buy one this summer. I don't think I would've done this if it weren't for this whole story!!\n\nI know I made a big mistake and I have regrets over accepting Y in the first place but I learnt a valuable lesson and good did come from this situation in the end.\n\nThanks to those who replied to my original post!! :)", "score": 4, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1740689410.0, "id": "1izq47f", "author": "throwaway621_1", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1izq47f/update_really_regret_my_choice_for_my_college/"}

Yes, I'm in therapy...yes we are talking about meds but in the past none have worked.\n\nToday is the 4th anniversary of losing my \"baby\" brother to brain cancer. Two weeks before that my very young nephew died of lung cancer. Two mos after that I was diagnosed with breast cancer-had a lumpectomy in NYC.  We lost a few other friends and family to covid, etc. that year too-16 in total.  That was 2021-I hope I never have to repeat a year like that. In late 2022 my younger sister died suddenly.  It's so hard to shake all this grief and I feel like I'm not functioning.\n\nBut I have to function because....we applied for husband's SS and Medicare  (in June to start Jan 1)and we are still getting letters from Aetna that info is missing. SS didn't send the correct papers and Medicare Advantage started a month late.   We've sent everything in multiple times, visited our SS office at least 4 times, got a Fidelity agent to help sign up so we could avoid issues like this-called from our vacation in Jan to be SURE all was in place-yet about every week there is another request for more info (a few pages of forms to fill out and more proof to send)-and just today a \"fine\" for not signing up in time (we signed up 5 mos early).  I can't manage all of this and yet....it's time to do our income tax which is complicated and really time consuming.....which means I'm not exercising or eating well because I have to finish that and send proof Aetna.\n\nWe also have a diabetic cat who needs daily meds, vomits and poops everywhere, drinks like a horse and has filled a giant litter box (actually a cement mixing tub) with pee.  Today I took out 4 full buckets of wet litter and 2 more litter boxes with poop-(I have to carry these across the ice and snow to be dumped-then use snow to clean them. It's a long process).  He eats about 8 times a day. Add to this, we are having issues with raccoons and opossums trying to get to our chickens-so I need to stand outside in 15 degree weather while they eat-then clean up all food.\n\nToday I talked with my cancer nurse from Sloan, and she urged me to exercise, because of course the cancer can come back....but how? when?   Tell the IRS I can't file?  Ignore Medicare and get fines? Hope the chickens don't get killed? Step over cat vomit and poop?\n\nOn top of all that we are selling a house, and it's kind of a tax nightmare-and after that planning to move to another country so we need to prepare for that.\n\nI can't do all this, and yet there isn't anyone else to do it. My head hurts, I just want to cry-I feel trapped by things I must do.

We both saw the eclipse together in April and I truly love him so much.\n\nWhat has happened is that he ended up being life flighted due to a heart attack, hospitalized and then he was sent home after surgery and about a week-half recovery period.  We were both relieved and I was so very happy that he was making a recovery and things were looking up.  We talked about our trip we had planned together and that I was saving up money so we could go.\n\nHowever, I was out with family one night when I asked if he was \"okay\" as he hadn't messaged me at all for a decently long period.  He said:  \"No.\"  Informed me that he was waiting for the ambulance to come.  I got a message from him later in the night saying he had a blood clot in his arm and pneumonia.  We shared some loving messages and emotes....that's the last I have heard of him and he has not read any of my messages since.\n\nI have no contact with his family, because we were in a secret relationship (we're gay).  He was worried and afraid to tell them.  My friends are not helping me, because most of them are involved in manifestation and Law of Assumption.  I am as well, but the lack of compassion and concern for my well being is really hurting me and making things harder to handle.\n\nI am so afraid to lose him.  He is my precious, I love him dearly.\n\n(Sorry for deleting the other post, uploaded it in my throw away account by mistake)\n\nEdit:  I have ASD, so things like reaching out to the hospital are like impossible in this muted mentally paralyzed state.  I am afraid and unable to show up there in person as well as it's a discrete secretive relationship.\n\nEdit 2:  I got contact and he is recovering.  ❤️", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1739769359.0, "id": "1ircdp8", "author": "Philleth93", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1ircdp8/losing_my_mindone_tear_a_time/"}

Everyone who saw how she treated me in-person told me that she was bad for me and that her promises to change and do better were clearly all hollow, so I mustered up enough strength and ended things. She threatened suicide, kept me at her beckoned call for about three weeks, and then rubbed her new boyfriend in my face before cutting contact. All of that was done and over by February 25th, 2024. \n\nI've been a completely miserable person to be around since then, evidenced by the fact that I've lost all but one of my friends, in-person and online. I have all of one friend that I can talk to, we live near each other but she can never hang out because of her strict parents and schedule. \n\nMy best friends gave up on me, decided out of the blue that I wasn't a good friend anymore and stopped talking to me. I've been lying to my parents telling them I'm going to hang out with them and then just going out by myself because I don't want my family knowing what a loser I've become.\n\nLife has just been a cycle of work, school, and losing friends. I'm constantly afraid that my grades will slip or my hours at work will get cut and I feel so alone that it actually physically hurts. I'm completely starved of human connection and interaction. I just want someone to hold me and tell me everything is somehow going to be okay. I want to cry. I want to scream. How could everything go so wrong in a year?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "Hey,\n\nIMO it's never good to second guess a decision you already made. As you know, and everybody knew, it seems she was not right for you. That choice is made. Trust past-you, and don't look back.\n\nOn the loneliness, it does suck. I went through it, too. If you are honest with yourself, what do you think hurts more, the loneliness itself, or thinking you are a loser because you are alone? I think the latter is very commonly the most painful, and that's good, because it's easier to fix. It's just not true. \n\n1. You are not 'better' or 'more valuable' as a person just from having many friends and/or a girlfriend. We are used to measure ourselves like that, but it's really BS. Only being a good person makes you better, and many great people have, for whatever reason, spent most of their lives alone.\n\n2. This is most likely a temporary situation. You are very young and you already had a girlfriend. which suggests to me, you do better than average with girls (a lot better than myself :D). The pain from the breakup will pass, and you'll have friends and a girlfriend again. This is by far the most likely outcome.\n\nIf I can give advice (of course, always take a stranger's advice with a grain of salt) I'd say learnt to enjoy time by yourself. Think about what gives meaning to your life, learn things, exercise (even if just walking!). When you start liking yourself more, other people will like you more, too.\n\nAs for happiness, that one is hard. 'Temporal' happiness, like what you had, comes easy, and goes easy. Real, stable happiness will come by keeping a peaceful and kind mind. It's not at all easy, and it's a lifetime's work, but I believe it can be done.\n\nWhatever happens, you are valuable, you are not a loser. Everybody, even the apparently 'successful' people have their struggles  to deal with. As everyone else, you are dealing with yours.

Few months pass and we drift apart a bit, we had a situation early November she asked that we go for a walk irl joked of the idea of \"having a bit of fun\" so I think she was working towards a situationship type deal, but then because of situation we had a falling out that lasted just over a month till late December.\n\nBy December she's made a desicion to move away, I was upset about it absolutely but I also didn't know the details. Throughout the time she's been talking to my friend group she's been talking to one guy the head of the friend group a ton; He's 6ft, muscular, got a house, charasmatic as hell, but he's also taken as he's been talking to someone else for the last two months. I know compared to him I'm not that appealing, she seems to like guys that are taller muscular etc where as I'm about one inch taller than her but I'd say average in terms of looks, she's not much of a looker either but it's her heart that got me.\n\nHere's the kicker; Since seeing eachother a bit more since late december we've had flirty chemestry which peaked my interest agin in her, but as I mentioned the main guy in this friend group offered her a spare room to just stay in for a bit until she can find her own place which is fine, but she moved without a job without really much in terms of a safety net to live with him in the hope he'll be interested, as not only that she has a HUGE problem with the girl he's dating.\n\nNext month a lot of us are meeting up in London where both girls will be there, my crush told me shortly before she moved as we went on a walk together she's compilling evidence against the girl he's dating that she's a psycopath even going as far as talking to her ex often to dig up details, she of course left out the information that she's madly in love with him but I strongly suspect she's then going to try swoop in to comfort then try her luck, but he's completely oblivious to this.\n\nThe crush even said on the walk it's most likely going to split the friend group, two other friends who we're both close to sat me down recently to tell me what her grand scheme is as theyre very much aware what she's doing and we all do agree it's going to blow up badly for her if she continues this, which is why she's trying to be tactiful getting someone to tell him about the current girlfriend so she's not directly involved. I had a strong feeling this was the case for a while, so having acknowlegment that it's true absolutely stings a bit.\n\nI absolutely want to tell him what her plan is, but I honestly don't know what to do.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "I'm sorry this happened to you. As you likely know, the pain will fade over time, but sometimes hearing it from someone else can be reassuring. I promise it'll get better and one day you'll look back.\n\nI have a few suggestions based off of my personal experience and also your comment history which I had a quick peak at.\n\n1. Shower because it helps your mental health when you're sad as you mentioned in another thread. (And shower daily.) There is science behind this too. A clean body can be conducive to a health mind. (Also clean your house. Clean house clean mind.)\n\n2. Get a better therapist if you haven't already. Therapy can really help you process things. Hell even just saying things out loud, to a friend or just writing them down (in a diary, perhaps?) can help a lot.\n\n3. Nobody ever wants to hear this advice but it's probably the best advice on this whole list: get exercising. Exercise will do wonders for your mental health and physical health. Just do it. (Assuming you don't already, of course.)\n\n4. Read a book you've already read that makes you feel comfortable. For me that's the GoT books or the Harry Potter series. You could just read a new book but that personally doesn't work for me because I end up not being able to focus on it if I'm emotionally distressed. A book I know well works better, it allows my mind to wander and gradually process things at the same time. I recommend audio books which will free you up to go on a walk or sit more comfortably while listening.\n\n5. Hang out with friends. Being around other people helps so much and not just because you have someone to vent to. It's literally coded into our DNA. Being around others, even if it's 1 or 2 people at a time, really reduces emotional trauma and helps with processing.\n\n6. Eat healthy food. You are what you eat. If you're binge eating ice cream you're gonna feel awful. Make a chicken salad or a healthy sandwich, etc, etc. My go-to is burritos which aren't the *healthiest* thing but they are a hell of a lot better than ice cream.\n\n7. Apply for a defensive driving course if the crash is causing you significant distress. Knowing that you know how to react in any future situations like that can be a major help mentally. Even if it never happens again (and there's a good chance it won't) you'll feel better just knowing you're prepared.\n\n8. Cut out doomscrolling. Most people these days so some form of doomscrolling about one topic or another. Cut it out entirely. Only look at content that is positive. You'd be surprised how much of a difference this can make on your mental health. The algorithims want us to be consistently anxious because that drives engagement. Don't let it control you.\n\n9. Use your current emotions and stress to do something creative. I personally can't draw or paint but if I could I'd definitely do this. This could extend to making a video essay on a topic you're interested in even. Or any other creative outlet you enjoy.\n\n10. Something that helps me that I only discovered recently is mindfulness. That is to say, focusing entirely on the present moment. Nothing bad is happening to you at this exact moment so focusing entirely on it and not allowing your mind to stray to anything else can be very peaceful. I do this when I'm overwhelmed with emotions and it has a surprisingly huge effect. You could pair this with going for a walk or sitting in your garden or listening to music.\n\nThink that's about it. Chin up, it's absolutely going to get better.

My main project is a modern fantasy with a grimdark and loosely satirical bent involving a tyrannical king.  It was just a loose analogy for authoritarianism in general, but now so much stuff in it reflects real life it seems hamhandedly on-the-nose.  I was playing the long-game, expecting to spin it into a series I'd spend the next several years working on, and now with current events, I don't even know if we have several years of future, at least not one where we have the luxury to sit around writing novels.  If nothing else, I'm expecting to spend it working 60 hours a week or some shit to keep up with the cost of bare necessities.

I don't know anything about content modding as such, but I don't really think you have much to be worried about. The thing I would try to remind myself of is that the people who hired you generally know what they're doing. They know how much work a mod does. They know what their budget is. They know that you're slow on Thursdays and Fridays. If they hired six people, they meant to hire six people. Maybe that means there's more work coming, so it will be busier in the future.

Like, I had a hard time figuring out how to start talking to people, but then I started going to a poetry club - this  was in college. The club was just three people sitting in a student lounge. But because we were all there to talk about poetry, it was easier to start talking to them - the subject was already decided, and because the other people had come to the club, I knew that they wouldn't mind talking about poetry with me. I wasn't best friends with anyone in the  poetry club. Now I can't even remember their names honestly.

The only time he gets off is if he’s watching you know what, or if we have sex, which is rarely ever because he’s hardly ever in the mood. Now sex in our relationship is definitely huge part of the reassurance because of the tension in our relationship when we’re separate from each other, we always argue. Every day almost all day, but when we’re together, we’re like the perfect couple. Everything just gels together perfectly I’m getting tired of having to mast**bate to please myself and there’s no point in asking him because he can’t get off without watching his videos. I’ve brought up to him about maybe letting me get what I need from one of my super close friends and he didn’t like that but he hasn’t done anything to try and fix his problem or to try and work with me sexually, the compatibility is way off in the sex department and it’s throwing a lot of things off and I don’t know what to do.\n\nPS I know sex isn’t everything.

I didn't care much for actually doing the course, I just wanted to leave my home life, the fire inside of me has been dead for many years now, hell I even said to myself when submitting that by the end of these three years I'd off myself if i don't feel better, and I'm nearly at the end of my three years. \n\nA few months ago though I met someone through a course aquaintence, mainly because all three of us stream but right off the bat it felt like fireworks, it felt like I found someone that truely understood me for me. We got close to dating even confessed to eachother we liked eachother but stuff got in the way timing wise so we kept as friends, I introduced her to my friend group as well but throughout even my friends noted I looked so much happier, she helped me find that spark I've been looking for, hell she actually indirectly made me push to be a better person. I did let my demons take over behind the scenes, as since I met her i often went to my friends telling them about her my thoughts my feelings everything \n\nNovember came around and she asked to go on a walk just us two, it took me by suprise but honestly it felt incredible, it felt like there was motion by her to push our friendship forward into potentially a relationship and it felt incredible. I did a stupid thing towards the end that made her uncomfortable, nothing serious but that paired with her learning what I have told a few friends about her made her back off completely for the last two months, and frankly I was devestated \n\nIt felt like everything came crashing back down; I started missing deadlines with university, i started missing classes along with meetings, hell even on occasion I wasn't there in friends streams as since she's there I felt like i had nowhere i can turn to, things did get better and I managed to mask the pain I had since my friends got concerned, she went from cold to that we'll need to have a talk then to actually lets not as it'll cause a lot of issues across the friend group, instead just asking for some space between us and let things fix naturally, so I did my best to just leave her be \n\nFew weeks back about mid December I set up a multiplayer stream between myself and a lot of mutual friends (I'm primarily a single player streamer, i just find it more comfortable) to celebrate a milestone, she becomes pretty friendly towards me trying to speak to me so we started talking again which made me so much happier, but I saw that she in-fact has a new job coming but she is actually moving out of the city as soon as the first week of Febuary, which I won't lie devestated me. \n\nThing is though I know because of my shit past because I've had a lot of trust broken by people I thought were friends she's the first one that I just natuarally took down those walls for, I latched my feelings onto her as for the first time in god knows how long she made me feel worthy, she calms my brain in such a way I don't think anyone else has even come close to. Though she is moving she has told me she will be back here once a week for university (Shes redoing two modules she failed last year) so we get the chance to hang out, she's not said anything reguarding seeing eachother though\n\nFrom my trauma I know i picked up a lot of shitty coping mechanisms; one friend I used to be closer to said to me that I put her on a pedistal above absolutely everyone else and that's true I do, but I just don't know how to open myself up more after the shit I've been through. I feel like i have way too many issues to count, and honestly I just want to be happy, I miss having that fire within me ", "score": 8, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1736556648.0, "id": "1hyjxgh", "author": "ThrowawaySteve33", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1hyjxgh/im_starting_to_believe_i_absolutely_need_therapy/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "MMFB", "title": "Long story", "text": "In Elementary through early high school I was bullied. I was always the tiny quiet white kid so I was a target for bullying that wasn't exactly severe but it was continuous for most of my life. I think this has been the root of much of my issues. \n\nOne I got into high school I always had a deep need for connection and yearning. After COVID we came back and I got into a big friend group. I didn't realize how bad of an influence many of those kids were at the time because I was still a dumb teen like we all were, but I expectedly got into trouble due to hanging out with them. \n\nI started skipping classes, got into fights, got obsessed with following drama. I never had friends like that, that at the time seemed great because they were the only people in my life to give me lots of \"respect\" and affection.\n\nI hungout with the group before and sometimes after school, at the parking lot across the street. It was a big group, probably the biggest group of the school. If you were in it, you knew almost everyone and almost everyone knew you. Until I met them, I never had any meaningful connections with people. I never had a girlfriend until then, only had a few friends every grade at the most.\n\n\n\nI have had a severe feeling of loneliness for years. This resulted in a lot of embarrassing moments. For one example; a girl in the group that I was friends with, who I'll call A. I had a crush on A and developed an obsessive relationship that makes me cringe so much when I look back on it. \n\nWhenever she wouldn't answer my texts immediately, I would fly into a silent rage and yelled at her one time through text. This whole thing caused some of the group to be divided over my reactions to everything, some thought (knew) I overreacted to put it lightly. Some got her to apologize to me which was bs.\n\nWhen A started dating one of my friends, I got jealous. I wanted to be with her so bad that I got nightmares of her having sex with him, and was always scared that they would end up doing it. When I eventually found out they did, my heart was pounding and I got depressed over it. \n\nEventually I got over it and didn't care anymore once the relationship wasn't relevant to me and there was never a chance. Also she cheated on her boyfriend so I dodged a bullet there. Though I guess she also dodged me, to be fair. \n\nI think this whole obsession towards being with someone and whatnot, started in 8th grade. There was this one girl who had a crush on me so hard that she basically sexually harassed me the whole year. I won't go into detail here, the stories with her are kind of funny thinking about it, but if the roles were reversed I'd be getting a teacher's meeting lol.\n\nAt first I didn't like her but after while I developed a crush, obsessing and fantasizing over her. Never got with her obviously, but all of that must have awakened something in me because I never even cared about relationships or sex until that point.\n\n\n\nIn Junior year of HS, there was another girl in the group. She was a crazy goth chick, who I'll call Z. She hated men and wanted them to go extinct, yet she got ran through by half the guys in the school. She started drama and fights with all of her exes and claimed all of her 300 exes were abusive or rapists. To be fair to myself, most of this info I didn't know until long after I broke up with her, but the red flags were still bright and waving in the sky. I was so desperate for love that I accepted when she asked me out.\n\nZ was my first girlfriend and sadly my first kiss. I was so unused to affection that whenever any girl would hug me I would freeze and my mind would short-circuit. She found out about my lack of affection so she put up some type of act about caring about me, she made it her job to always give me affection (hugs, forehead kisses). Looking back I know she just did all that to make her last ex (who I was friends with at the time) jealous. But then that all got me hooked onto not just her but that friend group.\n\nIt didn't take long for drama to start. Basically, one of her exes apparently raped her once and after they broke up he kept following her around like a lost puppy, also his sister was talking about killing everyone in the group. This was all her words because she was yapping to the group about this. So what decision do I automatically take? I want to fight the guy 🤣. At this time I wasn't dating Z or even liked her, we were just acquaintances. I knew the fight was a stupid decision, and I kept debating with myself if I should be doing that or not, kept thinking on how to get away with it.\n\nSome force kept making me ignore the rational thinking. Looking back, it was clearly because due to my past of being bullied, my life was riddled with experiences of being put down and made to feel weak. That fight was my chance to finally earn respect and feel tough like everyone else. So I went for it. Me and some of the group waited to catch him outside one day, and one day we finally did, but I hesitated and he ran away. I spent that whole week building up a false confidence to fight him. Then, one other day, we finally caught him off guard at a location across the street.\n\nHe was sitting at a bench and I went over and punched him and the fight started. It was a pretty boring fight, I threw haymakers every once in awhile and chased him as he tried to run away. I never even noticed because the memory is so blurry but he was actually throwing punches, I couldn't tell because the dude was comically weak but he was actually hitting me with his phone. He was one of the football players at the school so he finally hit me with a little tackle and we fell to the ground. \n\nFor some reason even though he had me on the ground, he just sat there and let me punch his face in from the ground. Two girls came over, held him up and positioned him for me to punch him again. Jumping is pussy as hell but I was blinded by anger so I hit him one more time. I walked over to the group and noticed some looking at me in horror as I felt something cold on my forehead. \n\nSince he used his phone as a weapon on me, I got cut on the head and was bleeding like crazy, I looked like I got shot in the face. But despite all that I was smiling because I felt I was going to get a lot of so-called respect from it. The scar on my forehead healed and is no longer visible but I still have a wonky looking finger from my bad punching form.\n\nI became a bit of a celebrity in the group and let it all go to my head. When I started dating Z, it was just weeks until drama happened again. That friend that I mentioned earlier who was one of her exes, he got into some goofy drama with her so I went through the same motions as the last time, it was just deja vu on steroids. I knew that fighting him wasn't a good idea but I did it anyways.\n\nHowever this fight was different. I didn't lose exactly but we both basically looked like toddlers fighting. It was embarassing and the respect I had immediately disappeared. Even people who weren't in that group or had anything to do with the fight ditched me or just changed personalities out of nowhere.\n\n There were two \"friends\" I had that acted normal with me until that fight, then all of a sudden they started picking on me, constantly belittling me and bragging about how I'm small and they'd send me to the hospital if we ever fought because they were at least 100 pounds heavier. It was non-stop.\n\nI broke up with Z right after the fight. While I brought the entire situation on myself when you think about it, the sheer domino effect that resulted from that situation still affects me now.\n\n\n\nI became extremely insecure about my ability to fight and defend myself. I became untrusting, wary, and angry at people around me. I got obsessed with following martial arts and wanted to be a magically unstoppable god because I didn't like that anybody on Earth could beat me in a fight. I know this all sounds like a supervillain backstory but this was my mind. \n\nI would get angry at seeing violence in media where someone gets beat up when they didn't deserve it. I hate words like \"ass beating\", \"ass whooping\", \"ass kicking\". I hate words like that because I know what it's like to be in a vulnerable spot like that and to have people say you \"Got your ass beat\", especially if you were a victim, is extremely hurtful but I've never heard of anyone having that same pet peeve as me. It makes me feel alone. \n\nI wanted to go to the gym, bulk up, and get into fighting. It became a daily obsession that I couldn't get over. I didn't have the drive to actually hit the gym so I just gained an appetite after getting onto a blue-collar job and went from 120 pounds to 160 in a few years. After the next relationship and inevitable breakup, I lost the obsession or drive to fight and become the \"magically unstoppable god\", but the above paragraph still holds true to me now. \n\nWhenever I would vent about my fighting obsession to people or of how the two \"friends\" I mentioned before treated me, people just invalidated my problem and basically told me to get over it because it was \"tough love and just the way boys talk to each other\".\n\n\n\nThe issue of the fighting obsession would follow me into the next relationship. In the summer of 2022 I met one of the girls that used to be my elementary school classmate. I'll call her S. We found each other on Instagram and we met at our old elementary. We got together shortly afterwards and the relationship actually started out great. \n\nIt started out loving and caring. She would tell me a lot about her past trauma and family issues. Her dad, Curtis, used to beat her and her brother when they were little. She got cornered by a boy in elementary, in the restroom, she didn't tell me any more details, all the kids at school made fun of her over it and called her weird. She would tell me about her ex problems, like one about how she broke up with a guy who proceeded to stalk her at her house and Curtis chased him away and threatened to shove a gun up his ass.\n\nThere were a couple things that weren't clear to me at first; How the abuse and trauma affected S and how her dad was treating her. The turmoil that would happen in the relationship comes down to my unresolved problems and hers as well. Also a lack of meeting in person. Most of the relationship was on Instagram because we could barely get any chances to see each other.\n\nAt first, I didn't recognize the terrible way her dad was treating her. He was always nice to me the whole time and at the beginning of the relationship the verbal abuse was very subtle, but it quickly became a lot less so. He would always yell and scream at S for any little reason possible, and always framed it as tough love and \"telling it how it is\". He said one time \"life is too short to be nice to people\".\n\nApparently the physical abuse of her childhood stopped when her mom got fed up with it but it just turned into verbal abuse afterwards. However, one time while we were together (in the relationship) her dad hit her, pulled her hair, and hit her mom over a stupid argument. \n\nShe had lots of health problems for someone who was 19, like arthritis, carpel tunnel, and alpha gal syndrome. She couldn't eat much meat and her health was going downhill. They had an argument about medicine and I guess he got mad enough to hit people.\n\nIt was awkward having to go over to his house and pretend nothing happened. I wanted to fight him but I had finally learned from the first two fights that it wouldn't be worth it. I'd either get beat up, or shot. I hated that all I could do was just ignore the whole situation, I hate the powerlessness of it.\n\nThat was the gist of that whole situation, but the relationship still remained strong for awhile. However the honeymoon phase ended in just a few months, and as the arguments began, the relationship became chaotic from there. The arguments looking back were very minor, in a normal relationship these would not have been big deals at all. \n\nOne example, I had vented to her one time about my fighting obsession and she gave me advice, but part of the advice was that you can't win every fight and that to become a better fighter you have to get \"fucked up to fuck somebody up\". I didn't want to hear that because I wanted to instantly be unstoppable. I never wanted to feel the embarrassment and other people's shame at me losing a fight. \n\nShe said that if I didn't like the advice and didn't want to lose, then I didn't want to fight. She was basically saying that if I couldn't handle losing, I shouldn't be a fighter, which is true, but the issue here is that I don't think she fully comprehended my problem, and I didn't at the time either. \n\nEverything I'm writing here I'm able to because I've had a lot of time to personally grow and figure out my own mind. I never wanted to be a fighter, I just wanted to be left alone for once in my life. She thought I just wanted to fight but that was just all a way of coping. The argument escalated and I got exhausted from it and cut it off. She got upset about that and asked \"Are you going to go to sleep every time we have an argument?\". \n\nI basically said \"No but this argument is stressing me out too much, I need a break\" and she called me a dickhead and said if I didn't want to talk to her then I shouldn't ever talk to her. Then all of that ended. I could barely sleep that night, when I woke up I sent an apology to her and went to work dreading the breakup to happen. \n\nShe texted me back eventually and said \"I want to give you a hug. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you a dickhead I was just so upset\". We made up after that and the relationship actually seemed stronger afterwards, but now that I can look back I know that it was a big crack in the foundation. That was the beginning of a chaotic and up-and-down rest of the relationship. We didn't have many arguments, but they were all pretty stupid.\n\nThere was one where me, S, and her friends were in a group chat. I almost had to go to jury duty one time but I wasn't picked. I sent the chat the pic of the confirmation but S let me know I had my address in there on accident so I deleted it. \n\nShe told me to be careful and not give out info like that and I was like \"Ok, but it's alright. If you're friends with them I'm sure it wouldn't have ended bad\". Then she repeated what she said and I repeated and we kept going over and over about it. When the argument was finally over we apologized again and that was the end of that.\n\nAnother argument was a really goofy one, about what you call different Japanese swords. It's hard to remember what this was all about. We were talking about katanas and somehow we got into it about that and she kept calling different swords different names, but you try and look them up the names are nowhere to be found. \n\nWe kept going on and on about it and it escalated. I sent her a Wikipedia article about Japanese swords and she dismissed it like \"Wikipedia is an unreliable source\", like every single article is incorrect, to the point where even definitions of words are all incorrect just because it's Wikipedia 🤣. \n\nWe went on and on and I got so tired of it that I said something that was admittedly stupid. I was like \"Are you on drugs?\" That made her angry and she said \"You're making me feel stupid, I know what I'm talking about\". I don't remember anything else from that confusing argument, but it ended the same way the others did. \n\nNow, onto what ended the relationship. I went over to her dad's house and he was talking about fighting, how we grew up small so he had to learn how to fight. He bragged about being 140 pounds, and being in over 200 fights and only losing 4. \n\nHe talked about how his son accidentially knocked into him once which made him black out in rage and threw his son against the wall. He talked about almost knocking his son out one time. He'd always say he never hits women even though that evidently wasn't true and one time he had an attitude with S, which she gave back to him and he got mad and said \"I'd never hit a woman but I want to\".\n\nIn the discussion about fighting, he said \"If any of my kids get their asses beat they can't come home\". That threw me off but I just acted one ear and out the other. When I got home I texted her and complained about the shit he was saying. She said \"Yeah but I wouldn't have it any other way, it's just tough love\". \n\nShe always complained about her dad's parenting and how he contributed to her trauma. But now all of a sudden a switch is flipped and she defends him? I always felt like people just toy with me all of my life, and this triggered that feeling. \n\nI got upset about that and kept asking what he could mean by that. I said he's a piece of shit who'd abandon his kids (I didn't say the piece of shit part but I wanted to). She kept arguing that I \"Didn't understand, he doesn't just mean physical, but mental fights as well\" like that makes anything better. I kept asking what any of that even means and said that was all bullshit and she kept repeating herself. So it escalated and I eventually gave up and shut the argument down.\n\nThe relationship was hanging by a thread at that point. The last straw was when I was on my first time on call at work. I was very nervous because I haven't done it before and never had to communicate with people like that. It was nearing the 4th of July so S asked me to take time off of on call to go to her brother's house for the party. \n\nI didn't know at the time that you could ask a coworker to switch with you, so I just told her \"I don't know if my dad (who's my boss) will allow that, but I'll check later and see what he says\" and then she said \"Well go check now\" and I said \"I will in a little bit\". \n\nThen she said \"No go check now because you won't\". I repeated what I said and she repeated again, then we kept on repeating and repeating. I eventually got fed up and told her to \"Stop bugging me about this\". Then she got angry and told me I'm \"Acting like a little kid\". Awhile after that I got a call and had my completely stressed mind preoccupied on that so I left her on read accidentially and when I got back home she had texted me to \"Never talk to her again and don't dare to go to her brother's house\". \n\nI told her I got called so I couldn't reply, and she told me \"if you won't get therapy this relationship won't last long\". I frantically tried to salvage the relationship so I agreed to go to therapy and to get into martial arts. The argument ended there and she thanked me.\n\nBut a day or two after that, she texted that she \"wanted to talk\" so I immediately knew what that meant and was filled with dread. She sent me the breakup text. I started begging, \"That was the last argument! I swear I'm going to get help, I'm sorry\" to which she said \"Stop saying you're sorry I hate when people say they're sorry, you just don't want to lose me\". \n\nThat was correct. I told her I wanted to still be friends and she said \"It'll take awhile to trust you again but I think eventually we could be friends again\". But I didn't want to be friends, that was a desperate act to be with her again in any way. Right after the breakup, I just stared and dissociated for multiple minutes until I finally got up and told my mom. We went on vacation the week after, to Wyoming/Utah/Colorado. Great vacation.\n\nI didn't want to tell anyone about the situation because I couldn't explain or wrap my head around it. She made me feel like I was the bad guy the whole time. I've had a couple years to wrap my head around it and now I know the reality of the situation is just very grey. I'm still angry about this, why did I have to go through relationship troubles all because everyone wants to treat me like trash, then I get blamed for it, told I'm just overreacting to everything?\n\nI kept S in contact but a week or two after we broke up she had already put \"Taken\" on her Instagram. I don't know if it was real or not but that reaffirmed the feeling of being manipulated and played with by everybody, so I instantly blocked her and haven't heard from her since. \n\n\n\nPost-breakup, the desperation and yearning for a new relationship immediately surfaced again, and hasn't went away. Even almost two years later, I can't stop thinking about the past relationship, I still get dreams about her or her dad. Every girl I see that's even slightly attractive, I fantasize about having sex and being in a relationship with them. \n\nI wish I didn't view every girl with desires, but I can't get any of it out of my head. Whenever I find out a girl I'm interested in is already in a relationship, I get depressed. I'm depressed, lonely, and touch-starved every day. Every weekend I ruminate and cry, while holding myself, playing with my own hair, and hugging the pillow, wishing it was a person.\n\nIn the absense of connection with others, I have imagined the perfect friends, who always give me affection, who listen to all of my problems, who have similar values and minds as me. I don't get any of this with anybody I know. I feel disconnected from everyone. It feels like everybody is secretly plotting against me, like I'm in The Truman Show. Despite this, I still keep a side of hoping I'm wrong and a public act of seeming normal to everybody else.\n\nI saw someone online talking about how they have a friend group that sleeps over together and cuddles to sleep every night. That story stuck with me, that is another aspect of the \"perfect friends\" I dream of. I wish I had that.\n\nI had a dream of these friends once. It was us going on some type of adventure at some indescribable fantasy city. Every person there was made up, I've never seen them before, but one was familiar. \n\nThere was a girl at my high school I was friends with because they were friends with someone I knew. I didn't know them much but when she killed herself, I cried and still to this day I imagine if she was still alive. I don't know why I care about her that much but I guess it's because she's the only one who asked how I was after a breakup. \n\nNobody else even cared to ask how I was doing or of what happened, other than my mom, but she did. Why did one of the only people in my life who showed such care to me have to die?\n\nI never get the opportunity to vent and tell my stories to anyone, and whenever I did, it always felt like they weren't actually listening. I don't just feel alone socially, but mentally, I have never seen or heard of anyone with issues particularly like mine, or viewpoints like mine. Is there nobody else like me in the world?\n\n\n\nGoing back in time a bit, I've heard about a lot of people who have suffered brain fog or some type of cognitive decline when COVID happened. This is relevant because I have suffered a bit of a decline as well. Not during COVID, I was actually doing better than ever when the pandemic happened, but nearing the end of high school, my mind just suddenly weakened.\n\nMy grades slipped and I barely graduated, my short-term memory tanked, and since graduating and especially since the last breakup, I have felt like I entered a different dimension. \"Reality\" since the pandemic feels like a simulation. I'm being kept prisoner in my mind, and in a world I don't recognize. My brain seems like an old computer with tons of malware. I don't process information correctly and it makes working difficult.\n\nNot only does it seem like my mind is slowly rotting away, but physically I feel like I'm rotting away. Every time I've gotten sick since last year, I keep having Bronchitis attacks, coughing and gagging on mucas forever until I get medication for it. I don't know why this keeps happening to me. \n\nThere's always red bumps (like bug bites or something) that pop up on my body and they'll stay for a long time. I don't have any bed bugs in the house so I have no idea where these bites come from.\n\n\n\nI grew up on the internet since I was 10 years old back in 2013, using it for hours every day. Being on the internet for that long is an indescribable experience, you feel like you have lived another life concurrent with your normal life. Just recently, 11 years later, I have finally started to withdrawl from this addiction and have made steps to replace social media.\n\nI think all the drama and failed relationships, as well as the years-long buildup of feeling a lack of connection with other people finally woke me up to start rethinking everything in my life. I always used the internet to make life more exciting, to have more connection with people, but it never gave me any connection. All of my internet life has been spent on scrolling, watching videos, and arguing with people. \n\nI never realized how toxic this all was until this year, when I would try to vent to people and to my \"friends\" about everything and would either be ignored or invalidated. I got tired of being ignored, constantly arguing with people online about stupid shit, and viewing brain rot \"content\". \n\nI deleted Twitter (I'm not calling it X, fuck off with that porn name, Elon) and Instagram. I used Reddit religiously and subbed to over a hundred subreddits but I cut it down to a few. The only reason I still use Reddit is because I'm big into Lostwave so I follow those communities but other than that I don't use it much. I mainly still use YouTube a lot which I'm trying to decrease. I watched a ton of commentary slop and political channels and I've cut those out and refined everything I watch.\n\nIf only I had those friends I dream of, I could finally gain the will to cut the internet out entirely. That's all hard to do when technology is all you have to make life worth living.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1736129823.0, "id": "1huo8rd", "author": "[deleted]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1huo8rd/long_story/"}

I am due to start my work placement for college next week. My contract is until May 30th, with the possibility of being extended until August 30th. It’s an accounting intern position in industry (let's call this Company Y).\n\nLast summer, I worked in an accounting practice (let's call this Company X) in the town where I live. It was convenient because my dad would drive me (about 15 minutes), and I would walk home (20 minutes). The work hours were 9 to 5:30, and 9 to 5 on Fridays. They offered me the chance to return there for my college work placement—they were literally begging me. I didn't really enjoy it to be honest. I felt they didn't train me well enough. The office was dead as well, just a few others, some days I was there on my own. Quite boring. And so I wanted to try something else.\n\nMy workplace coordinator in college was also nudging me to go for a larger firm because accounting practice X wasn't her favourite for various reasons. Company Y is in industry, and I decided to go with that because I thought I wanted to try industry after already having done practice.\n\nThe issue is that Company Y is in the next town over. There weren't really any options for industry in my town. The workday is from 8am to 4:30pm. I’ll have to wake up at 5:30 AM to get a bus at 6:15am, which will arrive in the town at 6:55am. Then, there’s a 35-minute walk to work (I can do it in 25). The end of the workday is at 4:30pm, followed by the same walk back to catch a 5:05 PM bus. I’ll only get home around 6 PM.\n\nI feel **FOOLISH** for accepting this placement when Company X was alright in hindsight, and I’d have so much more free time. The traveling situation is a nightmare. I’m worried I’ll oversleep one morning or struggle to keep up. And then there’s the rainy weather to deal with. Company X also had longer lunch breaks.\n\nAt the time I accepted the offer, it didn't seem too bad but now the reality is setting in and I'm anxious and depressed.\n\nI wish I could change my decision, but it’s too late now—I have to tough it out. X was alright, if I could change my mind, I would go back to it. And I don't know that Y will necessarily be any better!! I really, really regret my choice.", "score": 5, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1736098676.0, "id": "1huccq2", "author": "throwaway621_1", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1huccq2/really_regret_my_choice_for_my_college_work/"}

For example, there are probably millions of people who have given up on promising careers without realizing it, because it was just too annoying to wake up for the 8 a.m. class you need to go to for that career. Which is silly and totally irrational if you think about it. Sure, it sucks to wake up early. But if you think about it long-term, the career path that class sets you on could make you hundreds of thousands of extra dollars. If people realized that waking up early would make them that much money, they'd probably be jumping out of bed. But they don't.

Everyone's invited, so grab a drink, wear your high couture tux and join anytime. \n\nI'm fairly interested in one subject and I'm open to people's opinions on it...you can be brutally honest and don't feel pressured to say anything too positive or gentle that you don't feel like. I appreciate anything, negativity and critics welcomed too. I'm not a snowflake, feel free to speak without fear and slap me with the truth. \n\nMy conflicting question is this:  \n\nHow does one learn to love himself if he never experienced love nor had anyone loved him? I'm talking about partners, romantically. \n\nLet's just say there's someone who is attractive, smart, kind and visually a catch, yet that someone is simply not lovable for whichever spiritual reason. \n\nAnd let's say that /that/ same someone has to spend his own life watching everyone else being loved unconditionally, even those far, far worse than him, yet he can't. \n\nObviously, such individual will start hating himself sooner or later and start searching for the reason of why he's inadequate to receive love as everyone else does.

The possibilities are endless, right? \n\nAnyway, my question is, how does such individual learn to love himself if everything around him keeps screaming that he doesn't have a single reason for it and he shouldn't? Is there a way for him to somehow learn that ability on his own, so that at least he loves himself when nobody else can? \n\nI do know for a fact that, if that someone had at least one partner in his life that genuinely cared about him or loved him, he wouldn't be absolutely convinced into the counter theory of it being impossible. \n\nSo, how does one live with himself whilst knowing he's sentenced to eternal loneliness and permanent solitude? By being angry and hating his existence to the core? Is there a way to bypass that exhausting and never ending route? No?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "Hey man. Happy New Year's. Hope your 2025 is more fruitful than your 2024 has been.\n\nThis is a really good question you ask, and you've put it in a way that I think is really constructive (which not everyone in your situation does). I think it's great that you're actively looking for ways to not get embittered. That is so key. I myself am an older dude but if you hit me on a particularly smart day a few years ago, I could have written the post that you did. \n\nWhat I'd want to tell my younger self, or you, or the hypothetical guy in your example, is this: \n\nWhen it comes to loving and valuing yourself,  you're making a very basic, but understandable mistake: You're putting all the eggs of your self-worth into one basket. That basket is called \"Am I Romantically Successful Right Now?\"\n\nThe way the thinking goes is that if you are romantically successful right now, you are a good, worthwhile human being. And if you are not romantically successful right now, you are a bad, useless, unloveable human being. This way of thinking sort of makes some instinctual sense just because you want to be romantically successful so badly that it's all you can think about. Your romantic success seems like a life-or-death, existential issue.\n\nBut the mistake in this way of thinking is fairly obvious once you can step outside of it (which is hard btw). The truth is that romantic success is complicated, confusing, follows no particular rules and is highly contingent. Romantic success is only very partially under your control. It doesn't happen to everyone on the same schedule. Some dudes it happens for early and regularly. I know those dudes. You know those dudes. God bless them. But just because it happens for them and not you doesn't mean that it can't or won't happen for you. The thing is, because you put all your eggs of self-worth in the romantic success basket, and you can't control romantic success, all your eggs get crushed and you feel like bitter shit.\n\nIn my experience, the answer is this: \n\nPut your eggs in different baskets. Spread those fuckers out. Take some of your eggs of self-worth and put them in the \"Am I a good friend?\" basket. Because you can control how good a friend you are. Put some eggs in the \"Am I taking care of my body and working out?\" basket. Because you can control that too. Put some of those eggs in the \"Am I pushing myself to learn / do / be more?\" basket, because that's a great basket. Those baskets are all in your control. Honestly, you'll never take all the eggs out of the Romantic Success basket. Few people can do that. But a few of your eggs getting cracked is a lot better than all of your eggs getting smashed. \n\nAnd I think this actually low-key the way to actually get to the romantic success you want. Because the one thing I've noticed is that what separates the guys who are romantically successful from those who aren't is that the romantically successful guys don't really think about being romantically successful. They think about other stuff and the romantic success just happens. It's counterintuitive, but it's dead on. I grew up with a guy who didn't really think about being romantically successful that much. Sure he wanted it. But what he was really into, what he did think about, was rock climbing. He loved rock climbing. Did it all the time, was always thinking about trips and rock climbing problems, etc. etc. I meanwhile sat in room and thought a lot about why women didn't like me. For some reason I didn't meet a lot of women that way, and when I did meet them, my desperation came off me like stink waves even though I tried to keep it under wraps. My friend on the other hand just went rock climbing and whether it was there, or anywhere else he went, like, dude, you'd have to pry the women off him with a crowbar. \n\nI guess another way to put it is this: If you're all about finding a woman, any woman, then you will not find a woman. If you are all about something else - rock climbing, programming, comics, idk whatever - than the women will happen along the way.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1735681169.0, "id": "m4r8vhb", "author": "tarltontarlton"}

It's plain dumb for me (or anyone) to define their whole existence and success by one tiny (and sometimes irrelevant) aspect such is their love life...but see, that's the tricky part. \n\n\nIt always feels to me like people are incapable of feeling anything remotely positive about me and like we're the same pole of the magnet. If that makes sense? I try to make friends, it never works and usually, I end up with men not wanting to be friends with me because they see me as a threat or get jealous of me (?) and women usually abandon my friendship due to their men being jealous and insecure. And then there's me who just wants a genuine friend and to be one...\n\n\nWhenever I try to get a friend, it just never works out. \n\n\nI had \"relationships\"...but most of them ended up horribly and most of those women were very toxic and serial cheaters. I used to consciously choose them as partners, I don't know why though...because I hate myself, I suppose? Maybe I was just trying to justify the idea of my own self loathing by purposely choosing horrible women that I already knew couldn't love me by default? It's a mind screw and my head is like, a labyrinth of insanity. \n\n\nI do have a great pick-up entrance with women. They find me charming by the start. I can even say 'successful' but only in the first phase. Overtime, it's like something flips in them and bam, they turn hateful. I'm not a cheater nor abuser, so I don't really go to the extent of giving them a reason for it...I literally don't even look at other women while with them and try treating them as queens. It just always happens. Switch goes on and it all goes into the HateTown.\n\n\nMaybe the people aren't really capable of feeling anything good about me but I just have something in me that makes them hate me by default. That's an option. \n\n\nIn summary, it just always feels like there's something about me or within me, my aura, my energy, vibe, I don't know (not an expert on it hence why I said spiritual)...that rejects people and positive types of emotions like friendships, support or love. I'm not bad looking, I'm semi attractive and fit (not a gym freak, general weasel-built nerdy skinny type) but this whole thing is just becoming an enigma, you know?

So it sounds like you're comfortable in your own skin to a degree, which is great. \n\nI definitely understand how, when you try to make something happen and it never happens, you come to think that there's just some immutable, mysterious force within you - some anti-rizz that you're born with that's just destroying everything.

I hadn't discovered some magical source of unattractiveness that was unknown to the rest of the universe. The problem was much simpler than that. \n\nSocial skills - making friends with other dudes, making relationships work with ladies - are just that: Skills. And like all skills, you're not born with them. You have to practice. Right now you suck because you haven't practiced enough and you don't understand the lay of the land. If you sucked at basketball you wouldn't assume that there was some magical force within you that made you never able to play basketball. You'd assume, rightly, that you just haven't practiced and then you'd practice and get better. With relationships, if your ladies all seem to give you the same response at the same time, that's some evidence that you are unwittingly doing something that makes them all pissed off. You just have to figure out what that thing is and not do it anymore. And the you have to learn what women like in relationships. That's a big job for sure.

These little guys will start breaking down an Oregano plant no problem, but this is where the Oregano's secret ally comes in: the Large Blue Butterfly. This butterfly looks for ant colonies near these plants and leaves their larvae on top of one. There, it will grow for a bit before beginning to move around, falling off the plant. The Large Blue has a special strategy; it releases certain pheromones, the only way ants communicate with one another. Specifically it will communicate that it is a Myrmica Ant larvae, and the worker ants will take it into their colony themselves. Once left alone, the butterfly larvae will consume all the ant larvae, killing the colony and saving the plant. This is actually the only way the Large Blue larvae can get enough nutrients to turn into a chrysillis and become a butterfly. The whole species wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for oregano or the Myrmica Ants. \n\nThere is no moral to this story it's just a neat bug fact.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1735202305.0, "id": "m3un9pe", "author": "SecCom2"}

It's not like buying something online or anything. In my experience, you can't just make a new friend to replace an old one, like you'd buy a computer to replace one that broke. In my experience you just have to invest in reaching out to people a little bit over a long period of time, and eventually those people become people you can trust and depend on.

Let’s start yesterday on Christmas Eve, I rushed down to see my boyfriend letting him know in the morning when I’d be arriving then we spoke again about our meeting time on the phone twice preceding our meeting time he even mentioned leaving early to combat traffic. I called him again just to let him know I was on the train he didn’t answer for about an hour and when he finally does he told me he was letting his phone charge and he was still home. And I guess he really dragged his feet because it took him an additional hour and a half when it was only a 40 minute drive and traffic was not bad. So after and hour I call him still waiting and he jokingly just says he’s in town and I’m like where and he repeats himself giving me no indication of where he is and then he finally lets me know he is 10-15 minutes away. So when I finally get to him (despite somewhat planning for his lateness and wearing 4 layers) I was so freaking cold. And he couldn’t even apologize he says that I didn’t give him a chance but he had multiple opportunities. He also has this thing where when I react to the things he does ie leave me waiting in the cold for 2 hours and I get mad he’ll tell me I’m not making him want to apologize and talk to me. Even though I have been cordial up until and even understanding after but he let me get in the car and just looked in my face and didn’t say anything its really upsetting. \nAnyways here we are today at a hotel that I booked planned for and paid for and he’s complaining that I’m asking him to drive me to the store 5 minutes away. I need to go to the store because I was asked to make a dessert for family dinner and I never got a chance to make it because I was trying to meet up and coordinate with him. Originally he promised to bring me the night prior but since he only got to me at 9:15 it was too late at that point. I’m crying because he’s just told me now that his ear hurts and he’s framing it that I’m the bad person  saying I can’t just let him rest (we’ve been sleeping all morning it’s 1:30pm and Christmas dinner starts at 3 so I wanted to prep my dessert before then.)\nHe’s going to tell me that it’s my fault because I couldn’t just chill and how dare I ask him to do something when I don’t know he’s in pain. (I told him to go to the doctor weeks ago but his ailments only come to light when I’m asking him something and he doesn’t wanna talk to me or go somewhere. )\nI don’t know what to do \nWith dessert — I can’t drive and the only store is 5 minutes away\nWith him — we have the hotel until Sunday and he’s being an ass\nWith my family — I’m humiliated that I’d allow this kind of disrespect and I don’t even know that he’ll bring me to my aunts where we’re celebrating.

They do not produce complex software, feature films, series, or original music albums. They do not create styles, and they cannot create; they can only copy.\n\nAny expert can explain the details of why an AI is merely an assistant in each of its fields of work or study. It is no small achievement to create at the level of a human student, but it remains insufficient to cause concern.\n\nThe bar for learning has been raised. This has occurred periodically for tens of thousands of years whenever a new technology is fully developed.\n\nThe invention of the wheel did not replace animal traction, which persists even 6,000 years after its invention. Seals are still in use, as they have been for 8,000 years or perhaps even longer. Likewise, for over 50,000 years, clay sculpture was vital, and even today artisans and sculptors can thrive if they are truly skilled.\n\nIt is true that some technologies appeared and disappeared, like Roman wax tablets or Sumerian clay tablets, but others continue to be necessary. It all depends on how good you are and whether you do what you love with passion. Don’t study programming if you don’t enjoy coding, nor study music just to become a millionaire with a band. Simply do what you love, and you will eventually find a way to make a living from it.\n\nIf it happens to be extremely difficult—for example, I like birdwatching, but I cannot make a living from it—I can still work thanks to my other interests, which are more profitable and in higher demand.  \nAnd I can finance the time to watch birds.   \n  \nFinally. The computing power needed for generative AI to surpass humans is still not available in a cost-effective way.  \nThe energy required to perform the computations necessary to match the processing of the human nervous and motor systems and replicate their works is extremely expensive and unfeasible. Even so, these AIs copy very well, but for now, they only copy. If you have an expert assistant to help you, it will save you a lot of time in your studies.", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1734414144.0, "id": "m2gd0ob", "author": "uncutest"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "I totally get where you're coming from. I'm not a musician or anything, but I've been very unsettled by what the future might be for AI generated artistic content. It does feel very depressing. And also, it feels very uncertain. That almost makes it worse, the uncertainty of it all - because you just don't know whether music will still be made or valued in the same way in the future.\n\nBut what I keep coming back to is this: Before 1840 or so, people looked at paintings to see what the world beyond their immediate view looked like. Then the camera was invented and suddenly you didn't need a painting to see what the King, or a landscape or a Church looked like. You could actually see the thing you wanted to see, as if it was real and right in front of you. I'm sure a lot of painters at the time saw these photos and said to themselves \"fuck, my art is useless now.\" Which would be totally understandable.\n\nPainting didn't disappear after 1840 though. In fact, it got bigger and better and more original than it ever was before. I mean, people can debate about whether painting was \"better\" before or after photography came along, but it's still here and there are more painters now than there ever were before. Plus, there's a whole new art of photography that enriches our lives. \n\nThere are probably countless examples of this: The radio didn't destroy live music. Home video didn't destroy movies. I think technology transforms artistic creation, but it doesn't end it. Art exists because not because it's cheap or easy or profitable - lord it is not profitable - art exists because there is something inside you that needs to get out. And as long as there's something inside of you, there will be art. No machine \n\nYou are an artist. Your job as an artist isn't to worry about the future or anything like that. The person who did the cave paintings, or turned a bone into a flute, 30,000 years ago didn't know nor care if there was a future for art. They just wanted to do something cool and interesting.

But at the end of the day, your exact letter grade doesn’t matter much in the grand scheme of things. What does matter is that you eventually understand what you are being taught. Even if you are getting it later, that’s a very good thing and that’s what matters. \n\nTests and modern curriculums in general are pretty flawed as a whole. There is no perfect solution where it works for everyone but things like teaching style, learning styles, and how the curriculum is structured matter and if that doesn’t match your learning style, you’re already set up for failure and it’s not even necessarily your fault. \n\nA perfect example from when I was in school was my math class trajectory. We were given a double sided placement test on math concepts we weren’t even taught yet and given 20 minutes to do it. That single sheet of paper in 7th grade dictated my math class placement for the rest of my schooling career and there was no appeal process. I have always been good at math but it does take me time to parse through it by hand. As a result of that, I got through only the first side of the test by the time the test was up. Even though every question I had answered was correct, because I didn’t complete it in time, I failed and was given the lowest level math class every year 8th-12th grade. \n\nI know I didn’t belong there and my grades showed it. My math grade never slipped below a 95 and there were several years I got a perfect 100 or better due to extra credit. But because of a single piece of paper, I never even got the opportunity to show that I could have and should have been learning more advanced math. \n\nIt sounds like your curriculum is just moving too fast and with how much math is concepts built on concepts, I doubt that is doing you any favors. But the important thing here is that you are understanding it. After schooling is done, grades hardly matter. \n\nI’ve never been asked for transcripts for a job. I’ve never had my high school or college performance questioned. Even though I was good at math and science, I graduated high school English class by 1 singular point on the very last day of school. None of that mattered afterwards. \n\nI turned what I knew into marketable skills and have my dream career making really good money doing something I love. School can feel like the most important thing in your life right now and with basically everyone around you telling you how important it is, it’s difficult to see past that. It makes sense because that’s all you know at this point and that’s the focus. But at the end of the day, I can tell you from personal experience that the second you walk across that graduating stage, none of those numbers matter in your life at all anymore. What matters is that you did it and the skills you take away from that. Everything else is just unimportant noise the rest of your life.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1733515846.0, "id": "m0re3cm", "author": "arrocknroll"}

Also, I didn't include everything in the story, so let me know if something is not clear. Thank you.\n\n\n \nMy story is not unique at all, but I really need your perspective. I met a girl through friends and I really liked her. It turned out she was dating with someone already so I let it go. She is close to 30, I'm close to 40. After half a year, we met again through the same friends and we went hiking where I intentionally didn't want to get close to her - or anyone for that matter, and we had a fantastic time altogether with friends. The next day I got a message that was reflecting on out age gap in a joking way, that I should be younger. So we started chatting a lot that week and by Thursday she invited me for a wine. We went out and it was amazing. I thought that finally after the frustrating online apps, I might have the chance to build something organic and genuine offline. We went on chatting a lot, going hiking together and go running together. The next week was been better: out if 7 days we met 6, all were really great. I started to think maybe there is gonna be a chance for relationship - we both hadn't had one for a while. She invited me over and I invited her over but mind you we were laughing and still there wasn't an overly romantic atmosphere - which was fine, we were having fun. Then we started holding hands - interlocking fingers, so I said okay this is going somewhere. She still hadn't sent me flirty messages and I knew she wasn't an easy going type, so I thought next week I'm gonna do something more. The next week she told me she was gonna very busy with work and I didn't push her. But what happened was the following: she decreased our communication by 99%, never invited me, our texting felt one-sided. I asked her after a week that I had noticed the shift in our communication was there something that happened. She answered me that she had a life and it got busy, which I acknowledged but started feeling suspicious. Anyway, we met and it was as if nothing had happened, but after a week of nothing compared to the previous weeks full of potential I felt I needed to get some clarity. I asked her what was happening because this contrast is strange for me and she got real upset, saying why she had to explain herself every time we met. I told her I just asked you two days ago in a message after our communication died basically and now. She said she didn't want relationship, so I told her ok I got it. Later that day I saw them together with a guy and they were running, which hit me because running was \"our thing\". She saw me as well and there was a sort of guilt in her eyes (maybe I perceived it wrong), but later she answered my message that she hadn't. Days went by, gradually decreasing both the quality and quantity of the communication but I still kept the hope unfortunately. We went on a walk together and again, it felt natural and happy and our friends said it's so obvious we are meant to be together as we have a very natural vibe (she put her lipstick mark on a paper put it on my fridge door, she invited me for a nap in her bed - which really was meant to be a nap, I know) so this was a good check for myself as well that I wasn't just seeing things. So on this trip she wanted to take a photo of us together, which she did, and I asked her if it's okay if share it, she said \"yes, we are friends\". \nI didn't want to be friends so I let it stay like this. Last part, hang on please. Our communication basically died, on a Sunday I got to know she went on a date, which put me in an agitated state of betrayal, or hurt or whatever. I reached out to her to a message, because she took an unusually long time to answer and she told me the same thing - she didn't want to explain this to me, I texted \"ok sorry for asking\" which came off as a bit distancing to which she replied she didn't think I was ready to be only friends with her. I never replied to that and she tried to call me twice the next day but I was at a party I noticed it later. I called her back, nothing. Next day I answered her that my message was really just an honest check-in to which she said sorry to overreact but she thinks I need time to process things between us (I don't need to be told how and what I - should - feel BTW) I pulled back with communicating with her at this point and I was so hurt and disappointed how things had changed compared to the first weeks. I told my therapist about it as well. We had gotten an invite for a party before things went south and I thought okay, of course it's not gonna happen but she reached out unexpectedly if I wanted her to come with me to the party. I said yes, of course that was the original plan. We went and when she saw me her face glowed up and it was again awesome - we had loads of fun, our other friends told me privately - wow you are beautiful together etc etc. I was sitting in the sofa she came around putting her fingers in my hair asking what I was up to, we were very close together all night long, looking at each other etc. Up until a point when she asked me what I think of us, can we be friends? I said no, I want more. She told me she is not attracted to me, to which I said, why would she ask me this in the middle of the party when we are having so much fun? Also even if we are friends how can say things like that. She even said she was consciously limiting our communication. Anyway, we left the party together and I told her everything, like I don't like and can't process this push and pull dynamic, she didn't even want to remember holding hands, and she admitted that saying her not attracted to me was hurtful. She then went on that there might have been feelings, she dated me in the first two weeks but then realized she didn't want me - which she never said BTW - only at this party. So after this she got upset again, got out of the car, and as I wanted to say something she said ok goodbye and goodnight and left me there on the streets. \nYesterday I got to know she has a boyfriend which put me in this devastated place.\nNow this is not my first heartbreak, nor is it my last. Apart from many red flags ( dating without telling me - I mean instead of telling me she is not attracted to me, it could've been better, or trying to gaslight me, playing the push and pull game - like getting flirty but when I react, she retracts, used me as an emotional anchor), I know that it is more about me than her, as my involvement was too soon and too quick. I am working on this, it was a great lesson. I am not judging her, don't want to, but I feel devastated and it would be nice to feel better. I'm of course not talking to her and I am not intending to talk to her, and I think she is suppressing some feelings towards me which she can't handle. All the things she said to me sounded it was just her way of distancing herself from me for some reason, but I feel every time I touched upon the topic for our \"emotional\" side she got avoidant, upset so here must be something that she is not okay with within herself. I need to move on but it hurts now, as I feel betrayed.\n\nThank you for reading this and I wish you a great day.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1733291128.0, "id": "1h6928b", "author": "Pleasant-Dance9736", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/1h6928b/feeling_devastated/"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "MMFB", "text": "Sorry you're going through this. It sounds really familiar and really rough. This all suck so much, because it sounds like you got really close to something you really wanted - a good relationship with a person you liked - and through no real fault of your own, once you got close, it kind of just fell apart. That's killer. It feels like it would have been less painful if you hadn't gotten as close as you did, and it just kinda stayed an unrequited thing. But as it was, it was a semi-requited thing - which is just hard.\n\nI'm no expert on relationships or anything, but it sounds like what happened is that she kinda tried you on for size - and you had a relationship audition, where you were kinda in a soft-relationship for a week or so - and then she passed. It's like you were a shirt she bought, wore once and then returned to the store. And that can't but make you feel used on some level. And it's all the more annoying when the person who does the relationship-audition thing to you never acknowledges that that's what they did. Fuck.\n\nBut oh well: Onto the next thing. There are many, many women who would love to be with you. All you have to do is find a few of them. That's hard of course. But you'll find your audience man.
