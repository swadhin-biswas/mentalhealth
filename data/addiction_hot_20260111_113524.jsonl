My father has struggled with opiate addiction for almost 20 years and over the course of his life has moved from oxycodone, to heroin and finally to fentanyl. He's had long stretches of sobriety but typically always ends up relapsing. This time around he had been sober for around 5 months, one of the longest stretches yet.\n\n I woke up around 9am to my mother screaming for my help and I ran in to find my dad with blue lips pretty much dead on the floor. I narcanned him and administered CPR while the ambulance was on it's way. He was out of the hospital at 3pm. The same day I was shaving my face when my mom barged in and started going through the drawers for the narcan kits again. The same thing happened, I ran downstairs and administered CPR and waited for the ambulance. This time he woke up before he was taken and refused to be taken to the hospital. We live in Canada so I don't know what the rules on that are, but they let him stay.\n\n 9pm the exact same thing happens, he keeps going downstairs and smoking fentanyl and almost dying. When the ambulance and the police came this third time, I told the cops this has to be a suicide attempt, he needs help that we obviously cannot provide him. He was out by 1am. I went to sleep and I was extremely drunk so I slept through his next overdose which happened at 6am the following morning. My mom and my sister did the CPR and narcan in my stead. Every single of one of these times I took the remaining drugs on the table and discarded them, however he keeps finding more apparently. He likes to get high and hide his drugs resulting in a place where he can never maintain sobriety because all he has to do is lift a drop ceiling or rip apart his room.\n\nI don't know what to do for him, right now he's sleeping but I know the moment he wakes up he'll go on the hunt for more drugs and his tolerance is gone now. I don't think he's going to survive the next couple of nights. We have enough narcan here to save a small village. I don't know what else I can do except pray for him. If anybody has any insight as to what I could potentially do, please let me know.

And not one of those attempts ever felt like I was getting closer to a point of feeling “cured.” (If anything, it felt worse as the days of abstinence dragged on.) \n\nWhat makes my latest (and last) attempt different? \n\nThere was no rock bottom. No cataclysmic life event. (Those had all been and gone. But the addiction stayed.) \n\nIt was something so deceptively simple: learning about what had actually “broken” in my brain. \n\nKnowing what had gone so wrong, how it had happened, and where each craving actually came from, is what finally took addiction off the dark pedestal in my mind. \n\nIt took a handful of repetitions to get the craving rooted in my mind.\n\nIt took 12 years and hundreds of thousands of answered cravings to keep it there.\n\nAnd it took 105 days and 1164 UNanswered cravings (or rather, cravings answered differently) to get it out.\n\nI promised that if I ever made it out of the hole, I would share my learnings with others in case it helps them as it has helped me. \n\nSo here they are (free, no strings attached, just paying it forward): [https://thisisyourbrainon.substack.com/p/from-addiction-to-agency](https://thisisyourbrainon.substack.com/p/from-addiction-to-agency)\n\nI’m more than happy to answer questions.\n\nI wish you all much strength and the very best of luck.", "score": 9, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": 1768086265.0, "id": "1q9imd5", "author": "julieeeette", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q9imd5/i_finally_overcame_my_12_year_addiction_and/"}

When I quit last year (alcohol) for 3 months after near-daily drinking for years, the boredom also came with anxiety, restlessness, and mild depression. I remember asking ChatGPT if I would ever feel normal again. I was eating well and working out. Eventually, about 6-7 weeks in for me, I started to feel myself bit by bit and started enjoying things more authentically. \n\nIdk about you, but I started associating alcohol with everything I did after work basically. Without it, my hobbies felt like something was missing. Keep taking care of yourself, trust the process, and if you start getting restless, go for a walk or something.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "addiction", "title": "My sister (27F) is an addict and we don’t know what our options are", "text": "My sister (27F) moved to Charlotte, NC after graduating undergrad. She was always a bit troubled (low self esteem, body image issues, lots of binge drinking and partying in college), but she seemed to be doing really well during her first few years in Charlotte. She had a good job, good friends, and lived a healthy lifestyle. \n\nLast year a few unfortunate things happened. She got laid off from her job, her closest friend moved away, and she got caught up with a bad crowd. For the past several months she has been spending every day at the same bar, drinking all day with the same friends and doing close to a gram of cocaine per day. She has lost a significant amount of weight and weighs 95 pounds now. We really aren’t sure how she is paying rent or for the drugs/alcohol because she has no job and no savings, and no one in my family has sent her any money.  \n\nWe have tried to drive down there to help her multiple times. At first she seemed somewhat amenable to getting treatment, but ultimately when the time came to go she decided she wasn’t willing to give up a few days of partying with her friends to go do it. She doesn’t seem to take it seriously or care about anything at all anymore except partying, and she also claims she can stop any time but doesn’t want to. \n\nMy mom is beside herself with worry of course, we all are, and my sister’s lease in Charlotte expires this month. My sister agreed to move home (Pittsburgh, PA) and coordinated with my mom to set up a time for my mom to come down to Charlotte to help her move out. Frankly it’s difficult to take my sister at her word because she lies so much now, and she’s already pushed off the moving date 2-3 times (the same way she pushed off coming home for the holidays and didn’t, and many other obligations she agreed to and ultimately abandoned).\n\nThe latest is that my sister is requesting that my mom fly down to Charlotte instead of driving, so then my mom can drive my sister’s car back to Pittsburgh. This is because, in her words, she‘s “capable” of staying sober for long enough to drive her own car back but doesn’t want to be because she doesn’t feel good sober. I’m nervous about my mom flying down there and getting stuck without a car or anywhere to stay if my sister goes rogue and refuses to go along with the plan. \n\nThe next big concern is what living with my mom will look like. My mom claims she will not allow any drugs or alcohol in her house, but I just don’t see any world in which that’ll be possible for my sister to follow. My mom is great but can be a bit of a pushover especially when it comes to my sister, and I am nervous she’s going to be put in a bad situation. Best case scenario she agrees to go to treatment, but we really can’t even afford it &amp; my sister doesn’t have health insurance right now. \n\nWe are just at a complete loss as to what we can even do here. My mom won’t give up on her, it’s not even an option in her mind. I know that we can’t force my sister to do anything she doesn’t want to do. It seems like it’s all a big joke to her, she doesn’t take it seriously (or even if she does it only comes in waves then passes eventually), and she doesn’t care about anything at all anymore. I don’t really see things ever getting back to “normal” and have no idea what the future holds for us. Literally any advice at all would be helpful - what are our options? Do we have any? How do people navigate this? \n", "score": 6, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768075754.0, "id": "1q9e6ds", "author": "chillable-krill", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q9e6ds/my_sister_27f_is_an_addict_and_we_dont_know_what/"}

I have a bunch of lyrics that I keep to myself because I don't understand much about music production, but I do understand words. Writing is a way of letting it all out. A shelter to my thoughts and feelings.\n\nI wrote a poem about substance abuse and addiction, back when I was mixing xanax with alcohol nearly every single day. I had terrible and scary withdrawals, seizures, relapses and it was so painfully lonely. I tried to turn a poem I wrote in those dark times into the song I needed to listen to. Maybe it's the song you need as well? To feel a bit expressed?\n\n*Even though the lyrics sound hopeless, today I am 2 years 7 months sober and counting!

I have had problems in the past with alcohol and then it devolved into stimulant use (coke then adderall, etc.). I took a couple months off the alcohol and I was able to quit craving the stims when I drank. I was so proud of it. \n\n  \nFastforward to now. I started drinking again. This time only once a week- it's a lot when I drink but it's way better than before. The problem I am having is that my psychiatrist prescribed me Modafinil. I didn't research (like an idiot) and took it. It was amazing. Felt like I was a different person. Only 100mg was the dose. \n\n  \nI wanted more and more. I didn't want that feeling to go away. Here where I live it doesn't require a prescription. I've been taking this shit when I drink to stay awake longer- like I used to do with coke. Now when I drink I feel like \"oh shit where's the Modafinil?\" or something to wake me up. \n\n  \nI'm so lost. It's 7am. I just got home after being at a random persons house all night. I took around 400mg of the Moda and drank a ton. I feel so bad- I feel so ashamed of myself. I don't know why it's so difficult for me to not get an attachment (or addicted) to something. They said Modafinil wasn't addictive but I always always crave more. And everytime I throw it away I just go back to the store and buy more. \n\n  \nI'm at a loss. It's made my work way better. I can focus I can do a lot more things and FINALLY I'm awake (not tired). But I feel sad. I know I'm abusing tf out of this medicine. I don't know what to do. I can go right down the street and buy more any time I want.\n\n I do have ADHD. I can see what life is really like with this medicine. The problem is I cant stop taking more than I should. And I keep having the addictive thoughts of \"oh I can't wait to take more tomorrow\" or \"If I run out now then I can go to the pharmacy and ....\". It's so frustrating. \n\n  \nSorry if this doesn't make sense. I am so fcked up right now after getting home. Any (nice) advice would be great. I am at such a loss of what to do. \n\n  \nThanks guys", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768050780.0, "id": "1q93q9w", "author": "Rolly2k15", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q93q9w/modafinil_abuse/"}

It’s weird but apart of me misses it. How I felt during the moment was serene. I haven’t felt like that since I stopped masturbating and it’s making me want to go back.\n\nI don’t know it just feels pointless. Like why am I doing this again. I’ll never get a gf so what’s the point in not masturbating?\n\nEdit: I gave in. Over the stupidest reason ever.

Sharing this in case it helps someone else", "text": "I’ve hesitated to write this because it’s hard to know how much to say without either oversharing or staying too guarded. But I wanted to try.\n\nFor a long time, I struggled with addiction quietly. From the outside, things probably looked fine. Inside, my finances, confidence, and relationships were slowly eroding. What hurt most wasn’t just what I lost, but the growing awareness that I was letting down people who never stopped believing in me.\n\nShame became constant. I avoided conversations. I avoided accountability. Even when I wanted to change, I didn’t really know where to start. I couldn’t keep living the same way.\n\nThere wasn’t a dramatic moment where everything turned around. I just reached a point where surviving wasn’t enough anymore. I realized that if my life was going to look different, it would have to start with small, intentional choices and a willingness to rebuild from the ground up.\n\nAs part of that process, I began working on something called OATH. It’s a project centered on discipline, dignity, and keeping promises to yourself when no one else is watching. \n\nI’m sharing this here because I know many people on Reddit are carrying similar struggles, gambling, substances, compulsive habits, or the weight of past decisions that feel impossible to undo. If that’s you, you're not alone and I want you to know this, change is still possible. Not overnight, and not perfectly but genuinely.\n\nI’ve also shared my story on GoFundMe to help create some stability while I rebuild responsibly.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "ahh this one is for me! Okay so, gaba is a weird drug it doesnt dissolve/release into your system like other drugs would, it actually releases on diminishing scalable terms because the receptor overloads. So for example you take your 150 mg dose, let’s say ~90% is uptaken, if you scale that to a 1,500 mg dose, only 10% will be uptaken. You’re going to get the max uptakeable amount, there is no overdose risk with GABA because of this. \n\nIt’s also not metabolized by the liver, it’s excreted unchanged with no metabolites and has no toxic breakdown degradants.\n\n Shorter version, take as much GABA as you want it’s not possible to OD and taking over the dose will always be uptake inhibited by the amount your receptors can process, the rest will be excreted, minimal risk.\n\nAlso not harmfully interactive with weed or any other drug chemically (avoid CNS depressants like opioids and benzos but that applies to like literally every drug in existence) \n\nYou’re fine, get it together lol", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768010991.0, "id": "nypptae", "author": "Soulsetmusic"}

I talk a lot and don’t have a lot of friends, so maybe that repels people but I always have luck on dating and hookup apps. I think I’m pretty good looking which makes it harder, and having a big dick pretty much just seals the deal with anyone I talk to. Obviously being a horny teen I was okay with this, but I feel like I’ve hit a stand still. My body count is like 10x higher than anyone I ever talk to and to be honest I regret doing this to myself. I used to justify it by saying as long as I didn’t get STDs I could just move on from this, but honest I don’t know. I think it’s fucked with my head too much. I’ve tried to have a real relationship and I came close pretty recently but my addiction ruined it. I just want to be normal and not have to worry about just being wanted for my body.

In fact, when I have a long-term relationship, my sex drive fades, and I have erection problems because my mind is used to having different partners, and doing it with the same person is boring and doesn't satisfy me. Over time, I've thought that the dopamine I get from consuming pornography is the cause of all this. It might sound stupid, but if you consumed a lot of pornography, maybe that led you to be homosexual, because believe me, I've never had a fantasy or an encounter. The only thing I consume is people with big penises who have sex with thin, white women, and the men are dark-skinned. I am one, haha.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "Therapeutic doses of pharmaceutical amphetamine are obviously safer than practically any dose of cocaine. If you're asking what is more dangerous between meth and cocaine, I think it would be kind of a pointless question. Both are terribly bad for you. If, hypothetically, we are talking about the cleanest, purest of both drugs, then you have to start incorporating the route of administration into the answer. With meth, it can be taken orally. So a 5mg oral dose of pure methamphetamine is likely safer than snorting any amount of cocaine. You can't really take cocaine orally. Well, you can surely swallow it but it just won't work so nobody who knows anything about coke would do that. However, I'm not really sure if you can say whether smoking meth would be safer than snorting cocaine. Obviously injecting either is incredibly dangerous. There are also different kinds of danger. There is the immediate threat of an overdose that could lead to death, and then there is the danger of long-term chronic use. Again, there is the nuance of amphetamine vs. methamphetamine. Methamphetamine I believe is certainly neurotoxic, while cocaine is cardiotoxic, I think. But I'm quite sure meth would fuck up your heart too. I don't believe pure amphetamine (speed) is either cardio- or neurotoxic, but don't quote me on that. Anyways, let's say you get through a long period of chronic use unscathed physically, there is still the less visible danger to your brain and mental health. Both substances will destroy your dopamine receptors. Meth is both a dopamine releaser and reuptake inhibitor, while cocaine is just a releaser (I think). Either way if you do either for long enough and try to stop, you'll be met with a long period of crushing depression and anxiety. There are dangers associated with that. Also you'll be malnourished and extremely sleep deprived. The bottom line is don't fucking do either, ever, and you won't have any problems. If you absolutely must choose the safest stimulant to do than the best answer I can give you is a prescription that you are prescribed for therapeutic doses of amphetamine or methylphenidate. At least that way you know what you're taking and how much, and the doctor knows your health history so they can prescribe something that is appropriate within that context. You may not even be a candidate for any of those but if you are of course those can still be abused and fuck your whole life up. If you have any underlying health conditions especially cardiac you should just avoid recreational drugs entirely. Trust me, you're not missing out on anything.\n\nPS Here's a classic chart that seems pretty clear to me (but I don't think it's comparing cocaine to street meth, but rather cocaine to pure amphetamine)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifhzwc8fq9cg1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=11156f89fb85593189c10e075feff3a185037046", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1767940082.0, "id": "nyjvxnf", "author": "Majestic-Baby-3407"}

I bartend and just landed a job in a big real estate company and I’m excited for my future but I am definitely struggling. I was a MASSIVE weed smoker through my years, as well as porn and alcohol. Nicotine is another story I finally got off the vape which I was doing since 8th grade basically and I am truly done with that and switch to zyns (save the lungs fuck the gums).\n\nI’ve had a long distance girlfriend for awhile and we broke up recently and I now realize she’s the best thing to ever happen to me.

I want to be a better man and I’m trying to find Christ again ( catholic school my whole life) but yeah I’m completely lost and need someone to just hopefully be in the same boat and help me out best they can.

You're not a bad, dirty or immoral person for having a preference for getting high. You become aggressive when you don't smoke because you feel a sense of deprivation from something you still want, desire and find benefits in. Quitting without struggle is not about willpower, strength, or discipline. It's entirely about your beliefs.\n\nSo, you currently have a preference for smoking weed, but your preferences and habits can change. All that's required is a change of mind. A change in your thoughts and beliefs. A shift in your mindset. I would highly suggest looking into the freedom model.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "You can’t force someone to get sober until they’re ready. I just made 8 months sober 2 days ago after 20+ years of alcoholism/drug addiction, the last 12 of which I spent as an IV heroin/fentanyl/meth user. I was generally over it already, but it still took me a month once I’d agreed to go to detox to actually get my ass to a 30 day program and when the day came to go, my baby daddy actually bought me a bag because as a fellow addict himself (who was a year clean at the time), he knew it’s not that I couldn’t get up without it, but I wouldn’t, so the end result would’ve been the same. Anyway, once I made it there and got on suboxone after a few days, I was able to start really seeing a way forward and out of my addiction. When I graduated the program, they pretty much insisted on giving me either the sublocade or Brixadi shot which I was hella resistant to until I realized it basically eradicates withdrawal symptoms because you basically just taper off of the buprenorphine and it gets you out of the mindset of “I need to take this everyday to feel normal” which is just a hop, skip and a jump away from how it was when I was using illicit drugs. I cannot stress enough how the shot (I recommend Brixadi because it hurts less) was LIFECHANGING for me and many others. It kept me much more even keeled and even after going nearly 3 months without it, I don’t notice it dissipating in my system. I know it’s hard to see your brother like this but he’s not going to consider changing anything until the consequences far out way the promise of the next high, so I say let your mom kick him out. Offer to pick him up and bring him to the detox center. Fuck packing even. You can bring him stuff after intake. Hell, give him $20 or $40 to get right first, but let him know in no uncertain terms that this is a one-off and if he takes advantage or leaves/gets kicked out, you’ll be loving him from a distance in the future.

I understand that weed is one of the least of your worries when discussing addictions but I believe that a major part of addiction is the relation ship you have with a substance. For example weed for me wasn’t a kick back and relax thing. It was a repress your emotions and feel safe as a result of being high thing. And as a result of quitting (I had been smoking since the ripe old age of 14 and quit as of turning 21) I have become very emotional. I have confronted my parents about potential feeling of neglect and my lack of self worth, my friends about things which I feel I never would have said without quitting and I’m leaving my house, whereas I really wouldn’t unless necessary when I was smoking. Being sober is its own drug entirely and I hadn’t spent more than a week sober over the past 7 years. I just want to say that sobriety is a difficult experience but one which i wouldn’t trade for the world. And this isn’t a you need to quit now, but more of look at the relationship you have with your substance and what it helps you with. And that thought process alone might help you help yourself. I have experience with other drugs which thank god I never fell deep into because I have a horrendously addictive personality and I’m still struggling with gambling however I now see the light at the end of the tunnel.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767862336.0, "id": "1q76ub3", "author": "Civil_Equivalent_505", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q76ub3/a_great_revelation/"}

It will prevent withdrawal from occurring because it acts on the opioid receptors, but you're just swapping one opioid for another. The benefit of Suboxone is the doctor can slowly taper you off. If he goes off the Suboxone too suddenly, the withdrawal can actually be worse in the sense that Suboxone withdrawal lasts much longer than other opioids (with a bit less intensity).\n\nIf I were him and taking only 1-3 Vicodin a day, I would rather just suck it up for a few days and be done with it. It will be an unpleasant few days and then he'll be free. The horror stories you hear about severe withdrawal symptoms come from super high-dose heroin or fentanyl addicts who've been using for years. Your friend doesn't have anywhere near that level of dependency. In fact, I wonder if a doctor would even put him on Suboxone with his level of use.\n\nFrom my experience with addiction, and direct experience with an opioid addict using Suboxone to try to quit, the longer you prolong the dependency with Suboxone, the more opportunity you have for addiction to creep in and encourage you to stop taking the Suboxone and use the good stuff that'll get you high. There's something psychological about letting it all go completely that helps you stay sober, whereas with Suboxone, you still have one foot in addiction.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767875347.0, "id": "nydxpz1", "author": "torsojones"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "As someone who has smoked pot and been black out drunk before (and has also been around others who smoke or were actively blacked) I would say smoking weed and being black out drunk can cause easy distraction and forgetfulness but in starkly different ways. \n\nSmoking weed frequently can cause memory issues, but at least for me it’s not immediately forgetting what I said. I may have a harder time remembering things from a few days ago or things from the past or something my partner may have told me a few hours ago. \n\nWhen you are blacked out it will be extremely obvious. Heavily slurring words, stumbling, etc… for people who are more frequent drinkers the signs might not be as obvious (ie stumbling) but the inability to hold attention to anything especially the things that are happening in their own head and what’s coming out of their mouth will be the biggest sign.  \n\nThe difficulty of getting drunk is dependent on several factors weight, gender, frequency, drinking speed etc … but my guess based on what you shared is that a few drinks would most likely not get him blacked. \n\nEx. I am a female about 100lbs who drinks probably less than once a month. And it would probably take 4+ drinks for me to be blacked. \n\nNow if you are crossed (drunk and high at the same time) it’s a bit different. I tend to feel like being crossed is more similar to being drunk than being just plain high. It can definitely increase the intensity of what you’re feeling. At least for me I wouldn’t have to drink as much to feel as much if I was to smoke and drink at the same time. Honestly I’ve found this from my own and others experiences with getting crossed: if you drink too much and then smoke you will throw up. So my guess is that if he was getting blacked and then smoking he’d be sick. \n\nI’m honestly not sure, based on the information I’d lean towards blacking out.

I've read that her brain can't work properly without it anymore and that's why she's probably having the seizures. Maybe because she just abuses it and doesn't take it in time. That's causing her the seizures. I'm worried I might loose her. Now more than ever. Because it seems like it's getting very serious and life threatening. I don't know what to do.

Sure. \n\nBut as a whole, the country and people benefited like crazy from it.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767772614.0, "id": "ny5xbab", "author": "gammelrunken"}

The biggest thing I can tell you is this: until you find a purpose and meaning in life that overpowers your desire to escape, it will probably continue to be difficult. It’s not about being sober. It’s about having a reason to be. Work towards building a trajectory that you don’t want to risk throwing away. However, sometimes it takes multiple months for the anhedonia to subside and to be able to reconnect with the aspects of life you find worth living outside of substance abuse. So keep that in mind. That’s where a psychiatrist could help. Personally, if I didn’t find a greater purpose, I’d probably be dead from opioids by now. Suppression of the urges alone is not enough. For some people it’s having a kid, others it’s a vocation. Anyway, that’s all I have to say. Also, harm reduction is important. See if there is a way to at least draw boundaries around what’s okay right now and what needs to be done. I’ve had pretty good success sticking with dry herb vaping weed, for example. But opioids are a no-go. Benzedrex no-go. Nitrous no-go.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "You want MORE drugs to be illegal?? Like OTC shit? I respect your opinion and understand it’s based on your own personal life experience, but I have to disagree. There are so many benefits to legalizing drugs (and I’m not just talking about marijuana). It is immeasurably safer for the users. There would be less ODs, less drug related disease and sickness, less drug related injuries. You don’t have to worry about your shit being stepped on or how strong it is compared to last time or if it’s got some kind of garbage in it that doesn’t belong anywhere near a human body or even if it’s been handled in a sanitary manner. Our prisons are filled to overcapacity with non-violent drug offenders, many of whom go into prison addicted to a drug, but generally not a threat to other’s safety or a danger to society. They come out of prison addicted to more drugs, and oftentimes come out changed for the worse. Drug addiction is defined as mental illness by our medical professionals, and prisons do not offer treatment. And how can a society justify penalizing someone for having a mental illness? It’s immoral. On top of all of this, the only way to stop the cartels and others like them, is to pull the rug out from under them. Take their product away and you take their power away. You will never take their product away by seizing it all through arrests and raids. The only choice is to take control of the product yourself. It would leave them with nothing. And all that extra money coming in wouldn’t just be good for our economy (can you imagine if the biggest source of money exchange in our entire black market were suddenly a legit addition to our economy?), but we could use the extra taxes to ramp up mental health care and addiction treatment for those who want it. This would be similar to what some states have done with gambling taxes, funneling the newfound money into treatment for gambling addicts. The fact of the matter is, a free society is a good society. As long as you don’t hurt anyone else, you should be free to pursue whatever you want to pursue with your short (and only) life on this planet. If I want to spend my life doing opiates, it’s my choice. If it soothes my anxieties, helps me get through the day, helps my physical ailments, and gives me pleasure, I should be free to pursue it. Even if I had no valid medical reason and I just liked how it made me feel, I should be free to do it. We get one life, and it is so short, and you’re telling me you want to live in a society that, not only tells me what I can do with MY body in my lifetime, but then they can take away years of my freedom if I’m caught not doing what they told me to do? No. Freedom is good. I’m an adult. I can make my own choices. Personally, I choose to be sober right now, but that’s my fucking choice, not theirs. It never should’ve been this bad or hard in the first place, and it wouldn’t have been if it had been legal.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1767769150.0, "id": "ny5qrbu", "author": "bionicmook"}

I've thought about trying it but honestly I'm just not interested in buying that thing, cracking it open, soaking the cotton and then drinking the crap.

And as someone who struggled with the illegal shit, I've ALWAYS felt absolutely flabbergasted that alcoholics manage to stay sober with fucking alcohol literally everywhere you look. You simply cannot exist in this world without encountering it at least a couple of times a week. Not to mention the advertisements. I've always said, I can't imagine how I'd stay sober if they were selling meth and cocaine at every gas station and supermarket and even had cocaine stores where they sold a bunch of varieties and formulations of cocaine. Like you're point is so valid and I'm very annoyed that people feel the need to even go into all the societal and psychological nuances of \"needing to be controlled\" or whatever dumb bullshit I'm reading down there. Just fuck off with that. I'm with you dude, it's tough out there. \n\nHonestly, my only real advice to you is you gotta start getting real with the people around you if you want to get sober. You just cannot be sober if you're living the double life. It's 100% incompatible. You have to get real, and you have to start working on it.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "I highly recommend seeking out a therapist, if possible to help you learn coping skills and how to apply them to real world conflict. I abused pain pills for years, got sober and didnt do anything to cope with my emotions and life. I ended up with a benzo addiction due to high stress and anxiety. If you cant seek a therapist, look up the DBT manual. I believe the acronym stands for Dialetics and Behavioral Therapy. Alot of the stuff in there seems cheesy and like stuff we should know, but the issue is no one ever taught us how to use these skills in the real world. They make sense to us in the moment but learning these skills you are more well equipped to deal with stressful situations. This is more a long term solution rather than short them.\n\nWhat helped me to stop wanting to get high for every little inconvenience in my life, I picked up hobbies. I keep myself busy. I paint when I feel an urge to do something stupid. It helps me to not overthink my problems, which would cause anxiety and that anxiety would cause me to want to use. The cycle would continue. \n\nNow for the vacation,  learn some breathing exercises. Breath through your nose, exhale through your mouth. And when I say breathe, this is the only thing your mind should focus on for the next couple of minutes. Nothing else. That feeling should go away, as your mind is trained at the moment that substances will ease the discomfort of the situation you are in. \n\n Try to redirect your thoughts when you start thinking about getting high. You dont need to get high and to be honest, getting high would make things much worse in the end. Its okay to walk away, even go to the bathroom for 5 minutes, pour cold water over your wrists, this creates a feeling of \"shock\" that usually helps bring my mind right back to where I should be. If bathroom is not possible, pinch yourself. These sound silly but at times our brains really do need a reality check. We get so used to dealing with certain situations in certain ways, its hard to change those habits but once you do, you will never look back. Its much easier to breathe, pinch, shock than it is to acquire drugs. Even asking yourself WHY you are feeling uncomfortable in a situation can ground you and make you realize you dont need to get high. You already did the hard part, which is stop the sunstance abuse, you just have to learn new coping mechanisms. Its possible and dont sell yourself short. You are much stronger than you realize. You quit drugs on your own without help. Thats more than majority of substance users can do on their own. \n\nSorry for the essay, I really do hope atleast one of these suggestions will help you out.

I used until my life fell apart as a result of using. It wasn’t so black and white, I was doing well at work, but I was sacrificing my family to do it. I got into legal trouble, and wrecked my car. It was enough of a disruption for me to recognize that things would only continue to spiral out of control for me and I’d end up losing my freedom or worse, my kid. I didn’t have access to healthcare, or rehab, so I went the MAT route. There are components of treatment there, and I clung to it. I now see a counselor once a month and have to take regular drug screenings, so I do my best to stay sober. 826 days today. Find a life raft, now, while it’s still your choice and not a court order. The thing is- it really is that simple. You will eventually have to decide to put the same effort into maintaining your sobriety that you put into using drugs. One path leads to your liberation, the other path leads to your destruction. You have to choose which one you want more, then you need to put intention behind it.

I asked if she’d consider and she said that she can’t because the pain will just come back when she doesn’t take it.

Last year mid year my mom found a meth pipe in his jacket pocket, and we questioned him about it and he said that it wasn’t his. We left it at that gave him the benefit of the doubt a few days ago my mom found actual crystal meth while she was doing my dad‘s laundry and he said it wasn’t his… obviously. We can see from his behaviors that he’s on it again, my dad‘s always been a very hard worker and never chills for more than a few hours which is totally normal for him. He works two jobs and does car body work on the weekends from time to time, his neighbor and him buy salvageable cars and fix them up and sell them. He’s always looking for something to do but this is on a whole new level. My dad has dealt with drug use and alcohol before when I was a young kid but I’m not sure to what extent. I never asked for details now that I’m older because well it’s in the past. Longest he went sober from what I can remember was like 15 years (ballpark) but always just alcohol he would dabble with then give up on it again. This one is just way out there! Meth! He got addicted to pain meds that he would take for his arthritic knee and a back issue he had but eventually he got surgery and got better. The pain meds would give him crazy mood swings. When he came off those pain killers that’s when this behavior started. Honestly I believe a lot of this started when he got his first smart phone and a co worker showed him how to use it and well he wasn’t a good influence. Showed him how to talk to women and he met a lady he cheated on my mom with for like 4 years or something. My mom found out and he left her and everything just started going down hill but anyways. What I’m here for is help. How can I help? Or what steps should I take? My sisters and I are going to have an intervention with him soon but what are key points I can use. I need any help I can get.

I would plan to taper for 6 months.  Stay at the 40mg dose for a few weeks.  You will likely relapse to a higher dose and that’s ok, just make sure and jump back down to that 40mg dose immediately.  For now on, you have to think of the 40mg dose as your baseline.  Once your comfortable at 40mg, your tolerance has lowered and you can get a buzz off 60mg, then you drop again to 30mg and start that process over.  30mg is your new baseline, wait there for a few weeks until 30mg is comfortable and your new baseline and 40mg can get you buzzed.  Then onto 20mg.  Another thing to think about is throughout this taper, you’re not getting high and you’re basically “maintaining” and so you’re training your brain to getting used to not getting high.

You’ve built real momentum here, and the fact that you’re asking for help instead of disappearing tells me how far you’ve come.\n\nA few important things to ground you right now:\n\n1. 15 months clean matters. A lot.\nTreatment 13 times and still standing here says you’re resilient as hell. Suboxone is recovery if it’s keeping you alive, working, housed, and off fentanyl/meth. Full stop. Don’t let anyone shame you about that.\n\n2. This is a systems problem — not a relapse problem.\nYou didn’t mess up. Medicaid gaps + employment timing screw people over constantly. This is bureaucratic chaos, not you losing your recovery.\n\n3. Do NOT “just go home” or disappear.\nThat’s your addiction talking in a panic voice. Nothing you’ve written sounds like someone who actually wants to use — it sounds like someone terrified of losing stability.\n\nNow, practical steps immediately (like today / tomorrow morning):\n\n• Call your Suboxone prescriber ASAP\nExplain exactly what’s happening. Many providers can:\n\t•\tWrite a short emergency bridge script\n\t•\tTemporarily lower the dose to stretch supply safely\n\t•\tRefer you to low-cost or sliding-scale clinics\n\t•\tHelp with manufacturer discount programs or state assistance\n\n• Reapply for Medicaid / request an emergency reinstatement\nLosing coverage due to income change doesn’t always mean immediate termination. There are often:\n\t•\tRetroactive coverage options\n\t•\tTransitional Medicaid\n\t•\t“Medically necessary” emergency overrides\n\nIf you have a case manager at Oxford House or through recovery services, pull them in now. This is literally their lane.\n\n• Community health clinics / MAT programs\nMany clinics provide Suboxone free or very low cost for people in your exact situation. Even a temporary provider is better than cold turkey at 32mg.\n\n• If worst case happens — taper, don’t white-knuckle\nAbruptly stopping 32mg is brutal and unnecessary. Even spacing doses (under medical guidance) can keep you functional enough to work and pay rent while you sort this out.\n\nAnd please hear this part clearly:\n\nYou are not “about to lose everything.”\nYou are in a tight spot, not a dead end.\n\nYou have:\n\t•\t15 months clean\n\t•\tHousing\n\t•\tA job you’ve held 8 months\n\t•\tInsight\n\t•\tWillingness to ask for help\n\nThat’s not someone circling the drain — that’s someone worth fighting for.\n\nKeep asking. Keep posting. Keep reaching out before the panic makes decisions for you.\nYou didn’t survive fentanyl and meth just to lose everything to paperwork.\n\nYou’re not alone and this is fixable.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1767735671.0, "id": "ny31iqp", "author": "ahandel2892"}

IF you do, maybe check through your Medicaid caseworker to see if there's a program like MAWD in illinois through the Medicaid office? It's specifically for workers with disabilities who no longer qualify for Medicaid bc their income is too high. In PA, you pay 5% of your income before tax (gross) as your monthly premium to basically keep the exact same Medicaid insurance you already have.

Even on 32mg/d, you can drop to 4mg/d overnight and still avoid 90%+ of the worst, or any, withdrawals. Below 2mg is where it gets dicey. This is due to bupe’s ceiling effect, the non-linear receptor occupant curve which flattens and sees diminishing returns quickly higher dose ≠ higher effect above a certain threshold. If 4mg sounds too sketchy to you then do 8mg. I’d bet money on the fact that 8mg would hold you 100% and any discomfort you feel is placebo. I’ve studied the shit out of buprenorphine’s pharmacology as well as being on it and experimenting with different dosages, frequencies and roa’s. I don’t know if you split up your daily dose currently or take one big dose a day, 32 is high anyways moving forward it’s good to have that amount of prescribed to you because it enables you to build up extras but taking anything over 16mg is a completely waste of time you’ve essentially already gone far over the ceiling and you can double that and see a negligible increase in both mu-opioid receptor occupancy and efficacy. I’d argue anything about 8 really is a waste, and the only benefit you provide yourself above that is a marginally stronger receptor blockade against other agonists. Anyways, I’m going on a rant. Drop your dose down. 4mg a day while you figure it out is MUCH better than going CT from 32mg because you ran out. In the mean time I agree ask other people around the house to help out, look into goodrx coupons for generic or manufacturer coupons. Some generics can be filled for like $30 a box.

You have 60 days to appeal in Illinois. You would base your appeal on being eligible for Medicaid for workers with disabilities which has a higher income limit. Not sure what this is called in Illinois but they have it. You probably missed the 10 day cutoff to keep Medicaid during the appeal process so you need to ask for an expedited hearing due to your health being at risk. They give decisions in a few days, I think within 72 hours. It’s a life threatening risk to your health to have a lapse in suboxone so they should absolutely take it seriously. You need to act really fast and have your doctor fill out the paperwork that would be needed to prove your disabilities. You can always try legal aid if there’s one nearby to help with this process but I do know you request the appeal online to get it started. You’d have a shot of getting it back far more quickly if you appeal and try for an expedited decision than if you start over and apply all over again.

Looking for advice on how to handle this.", "text": "Long story short (see my other posts for details). I’m an NPE. My biological dad struggled with addiction throughout most of his life. He was in my life until I was around 2 years old, and since then he’s been completely out of contact. My mom shut him out because of criminal activity, I didn’t even know he was my dad until 3 years ago. \n\nWell, I was able to track down a Facebook profile. We connected over messenger. He sent me an emotional voice note and messages acknowledging his addiction and taking responsibility. Some of the things he said were:\n\n“I was fully addicted, mainly to prescription pills.”\n“Everything I have done is just absolutely pitiful.”\n“Your mom wanted to help me, and she did help me — the only problem was me.”\n\nHe explained that his addiction began after a serious accident and said he’s struggled for most of his life, though he did have a seven-year period of sobriety. He also said:\n\n“I love you, even though I barely know you.”\n“Do not let me drag you down. You have a real good thing going on — that’s what your mom did for you, not me.”\n\nIn follow-up messages, he suggested meeting in person rather than talking on the phone, he said he’s nervous about taking full accountability for criminal activity over the phone, because he is paranoid about it being monitored, and framed it as a turning point for him:\n\n“On this day, me meeting you for the first time in 20-some years, I’ll start my recovery.”\n“What better reason than you.”\n“Seeing you will give me a reason to clean up and change my way.”\n\nWhile I appreciate the honesty, I’m struggling with the emotional pressure of being positioned as a motivator for his recovery. Im sure he is not intentionally trying to put pressure on me, but I’m nervous about meeting in person, how intense it might be, and what expectations might be placed on me — even unintentionally.\n\nI’m trying to figure out how to protect my own emotional well-being while still being open and compassionate. \n\nFor those who’ve navigated something similar:\nIs meeting in person right away a good idea, or is it better to slow this down?\n\nWhat boundaries are important in situations like this?\n\nHow do you avoid becoming emotionally responsible for someone else’s recovery?\n\nWhile I would love to make a positive impact on his life, I want to approach this carefully and realistically, without shutting the door but without carrying more than I can handle.\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767714204.0, "id": "1q5m0wi", "author": "topflobosss", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q5m0wi/update_now_in_contact_with_bio_dad_who_is_in/"}

I’ve been addicted to porn now for almost 3 years, at this point half of the time I’m just watching it and not jerking off, like I’m talking for HOURS a day. This morning i finally managed to delete my account and everything (for me this is a big step, as dumb as it sounds) The thing is that i don’t know what to do now. I’ve opened google so many times today and then closed it again to remind myself, it’s like muscle memory at this point and i hate it. Porn has taken over so much of my life that i don’t even have any hobbies. I play video games(not really anymore because it has taken over SO much and i can’t find any good games, most games I’ve played or they cost my kidney) or watch porn, that’s genuinely it. I don’t have many friends and they’re always busy/don’t have time for me. I currently can’t get into sports because I’m recovering from a surgery (i used to LOVE working out and sports before all my time went to porn). I’ve tried drawing but got too frustrated. I know this is stupid and i apologise but everything i find is either „go outside(for like a walk)!!!/ go work out!!!“ which neither i can’t really do for atleast a few weeks now, drawing i used to do as a kid but again i just get too frustrated and honestly I’m out of ideas, I’m just now realising how bad porn has fried my brain that i can’t even think of a hobby to do.\nI’m open to any and all advice/suggestions.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "I live very far away from my dad and have had to piece together a timeline of his symptoms and medications from my mom's (slightly foggy) memory. My dad is 71. In his 40's he suffered from extreme insomnia, anxiety, and depression but got through it in time without the use of medications (he had way more responsibilities in life to helped drive him out of it).\n\nHe has been retired for like 8 years. A little over a year ago he started having an increase in anxiety (triggered by meeting up with and trying to help an old friend who had become homeless and un-helpable). The anxiety led to some insomnia which started the old cycle back up. In 3 months it got so bad that my mom had him taken to some sketchy evangelical inpatient clinic where they heavily sedated him to get him to sleep. Then they put him on Ativan. He became a little more stable (but holy hell was he paranoid and out of his mind at that point). He went home after a week, found a psychiatric nurse practitioner, stopped the Ativan, and switched to a really low dose of Klonopin, eventually weaning off to being medication free.\n\nThis lasted for about 3-4 months, but then they moved from their summer house back to their winter apartment (cross state) and apparently some problem with the HVAC back in their winter house triggered the anxiety again (didn't take much). He called his nurse practitioner and she had given him a liberal prescription for the Klonopin and simply said, \"Go ahead and use the small dosages as needed.\"\n\nWell, \"as needed\" was not clearly defined and I guess he started using them pretty consistently for about 4 months straight (I'm not sure how high his dosage got up to). My mom was getting concerned because despite the Klonopin usage symptoms were getting much worse and the drug was losing effect (she wasn't really telling me how bad it was getting because my dad didn't want her to). She called the nurse practitioner at that point who then got very concerned and said he either needed to move back near her so she could treat him, or he needed to find medical attention immediately, so they started meeting with a psychologist who wanted to begin a systematic taper.\n\nThe taper began 3-4 months ago. My dad insists Benzo withdrawal is not the problem and that there is just something broken in his brain from all the insomnia. He thinks that if the insomnia is fixed everything will simply go away. He only goes to the doctor so he can continue getting Klonopin and sleep aids. He takes their prescribed dosages of Klonopin, but then ignores their rules about alcohol and has been steadily increasing his wine intake to offset the Benzo withdrawal.\n\nI told my mom she has to stop buying it or hiding it so he can only get the amount they told him he's allowed to have (they want to make sure he weans off the alcohol safely too). But if he runs out he \"makes\" her go get some (probably with a little touch of verbal abuse).\n\nI'm planning on taking some time off at the end of this month to go visit. Hopefully it can coincide with one of their doctor's appointments because I'd like to see how that goes and interact with the team there more personally. But I keep thinking: if he doesn't accept his situation, acknowledge the hole he is in, and make any effort to work towards healing, I sort of don't know what to do.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "I’m really sorry. What you’re describing is genuinely traumatic to witness, especially from a distance. Benzo withdrawal can look exactly like what you’re seeing — rage, paranoia, despair, pacing, insomnia, weight loss, refusal to engage, and the “I’m cursed / beyond hope” narrative. That doesn’t make it any less terrifying, but it does mean this isn’t a moral failure or a personality collapse it’s a nervous system in crisis.\n\nA few important things, said gently but honestly:\n\n1. This is bigger than what you can fix as a son.\nYou’re doing the right thing by caring, staying engaged, and asking for help — but this is not something love, logic, or better suggestions alone can solve. Benzo withdrawal hijacks perception. When he rages at help, it’s not because the help is bad — it’s because his brain literally cannot tolerate change or stimulation right now.\n\n2. The alcohol is a real red flag.\nI know it’s “only” a few minis, but alcohol + benzo withdrawal is dangerous and often prolongs withdrawal and worsens mood instability. This doesn’t mean panic — it means the situation deserves escalation beyond “wait it out.”\n\n3. Your mom’s wellbeing matters just as much.\nWhat you described sounds like caregiver burnout bordering on trauma. Feeling like a prisoner, walking on eggshells, absorbing rage — that takes a toll. Loving someone doesn’t mean sacrificing your own mental or physical safety indefinitely.\n\n4. You don’t need power of attorney to set boundaries or seek guidance.\nEven without POA, you can:\n\t•\tTalk privately with his doctors (they can’t share info, but they can listen)\n\t•\tAsk about involuntary evaluation criteria in their state (not to threaten him — to know options)\n\t•\tEncourage your mom to speak with a caregiver support line or therapist ASAP\n\t•\tExplore medical detox vs. benzo-aware taper programs (they are very different)\n\n5. His refusal doesn’t mean there are no options — it means timing and framing matter.\nRight now, arguing with him about solutions is likely pointless and may escalate things. Often the most effective approach is:\n\t•\tReduce confrontation\n\t•\tFocus on safety and stabilization\n\t•\tShift decision-making to professionals when necessary\n\nIf your mom is reaching the end of her rope, it may be time to gently but firmly prioritize her support — even if he refuses help. That could mean:\n\t•\tA temporary separation for her safety and rest\n\t•\tInvolving medical professionals directly\n\t•\tMaking contingency plans without announcing them to him\n\nNone of this makes you disloyal. It makes you responsible.\n\nLastly benzo withdrawal is survivable, even when it looks this bleak. People do come out the other side. But it often requires more support than one exhausted spouse and one worried son can provide.\n\nYou’re not abandoning him by seeking help.\nYou’re not betraying him by protecting your mom.\nAnd you’re not failing because you can’t fix this from 10 hours away.\n\nYou’re doing the best you can in an impossible situation.

I'm just a guy who has been trying to get clean for over two decades and finally found something that stuck. I started my current path on September 1st, 2025, and something felt different this time. I wanted to document it. Not for anyone else at first. Just for me. To remember what it actually felt like in those early days when everything is loud and raw and your skin feels like it's on inside out.\n\nWhat came out of that was a 90 day guided journal called The Next Right Move: A Field Guide to Early Recovery One Honest Day at a Time. Each day has a reflection, an intention, a prayer, and a practical exercise I call The Next Right Move. Every single word was written while I was living it. Day 12 was written on day 12. Day 47 was written on day 47. I didn't go back and clean it up to sound wiser than I was. I wanted it to feel like someone walking beside you, not standing above you telling you what to do.\n\nMy intention with this thing is simple. I want someone in their first week or their first month to open it and feel less alone. To read something and think yeah, that's exactly what this feels like. I wrote about fear, about urges that sound reasonable, about wanting to crawl out of your own body, about grief and shame and all the stuff we don't talk about because we think it makes us weak. I also wrote about what started working for me. Not in a preachy way. Just honest.\n\nBefore I publish this I want real feedback from the people it's actually for. Not my friends who will tell me it's great. Not my family who are just glad I'm alive. I want someone in recovery or early sobriety to read it and tell me the truth. Does it land? Does it help? Is there anything that feels off or harmful or tone deaf? I can take it. I need to hear it.\n\nIf you're willing to read it and give me honest input I would be deeply grateful. It's 90 days worth of content but each day is designed to take about 30 minutes, the reading plus the exercise. You don't have to go through the whole thing. Even feedback on the first week or two would help. I can send it as a Word doc or PDF, whatever works for you.\n\nThis book is the most personal thing I've ever made. I'm not trying to get rich off it. I just know how alone I felt for so long and if this helps even one person feel less alone it will be worth every uncomfortable word I put on the page.\n\nThanks for reading this.

My emotions are running up and down. A bit annoying since this time Im not walking of 3+ years of being fucked up on something nearly daily. This time I recognized my addictive patterns before it went really really bad and stopped it before it got worse than it could be. \n\n  \nKinda shows ive grown a bit in my 30 years on this earth. I kinda think the mood is messed up because Ive told myself to quit, its an absolute, a truth, not an abstract \"im gonna stop in the future\"-thought. I dunno, feels hopeless right now, like nothing is going to be okay. Drugs are an exellent crutch, you allways know that, even how bad life gets, you could always find a sollution and happiness in a drug. But now I dont have that to lean myself against anymore. And that is scary. \n\n  \nIve always been restless, prone to depression and anxiety. So right now my catastrophic thoughts are of the roof, couldnt sleep til 6 in the morning last night, couldnt stop thinking about all the stuff that \"will\" go wrong and why. \n\n  \nI thought a lot about love, i have not been in love or been on a date or touched a woman for 6 soon to be 7 years. Had a girlfriend while I was an addict, we used together, the drugs destroyed our love and when I quit it died. Since then Ive developed this fear of dating and intimacy. Been struggling with porn addiction for many years and still do. So a lot of times when Ive tried to fuck my dick wont work because of my porn and masturbation habbits - its so fucking hard to stop guys. Jesus its a problem. But i cant stop. \n\n  \nIn the middle of addiction I lost my big sister, she chose to leave this earth by her own hand and I think that also made me scared of emotional connection in a way. Because that really fucking hurt. I thought the pain was going to drive me insane. Like literaly. SInce then its so fucking hard to get close to people. I always keep them at a distance, I never tell people how I really feel, always \"im fine\" and a smile you know. \n\n  \nI dunno why but I always feels alone, but Ive always had friends, I have many good friends that I love and they seem to love me. Still i feel alone and it feels like im gonna die alone. That scares me. \n\n\n\nGonna stop now, or im gonna continue forever. Todays been good and bad. Right now its bad, I dont wanna go to sleep, just wanna get fucked up, but I wont. \n\n  \nThanks again for all of you who read and write comments.

They never smoked around me, just on the balcony, but the smoke blew inside.\n\nThen I started teaching and after a stressful day, I noticed I was craving a cigarette.\n\nIt went away.\n\nBut recently, every single day, I constantly think about smoking.

So I scroll and listen to my music, but after a while, from being online so much, I forget where I am, that I'm actually alone...\nForgetting where I am and going off the rails, and after a while I'm forced to realize that I'm all alone and that I'm not paying attention to what I want to do or say, but it's against me.\n\n\nThere's no reason not to accept that what works for the first time will continue to work throughout the evening, and that's where things get messy.\n\nIt's going downhill because I'm using CC, which gave me a lot of pleasure at first, but I don't think it'll come back, so it sucks because you feel good at the beginning and then it doesn't work anymore.\n\nLOL the guy who wants to justify himself, but to be clear, after a while my brain glitches and it basically asks itself, \"How can I enjoy MY... lol, it's so lame.\"\n\nAnd it goes in circles:\n\nNo, I'm going too far, I feel alone, and so I get lost looking for approval around me, and in the end, I forget myself...\n\nThanks, because you wrote this, I can admit to myself that I just want to relive those first feelings.\n\nThis post did me good because by writing it, I was able to understand what I was looking for, which is that you have to avoid getting stuck on what you want because the more you focus on it, the less you get it.\n\nThanks, but it's still not clear.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "I thought I was immune to cravings. Because it’s been a little over 10 years that I’ve been off of Suboxone.\n\nBut last May I was scrolling through Facebook, which is unusual because I don’t love Facebook and I seen a post and I’m like that date looks familiar. So I blow it up and that is how I found out that my eldest sister died. The kicker was she had died three weeks earlier.\n\nThere was 18 years between me and my oldest sister, same father. We did not have a very close relationship and we didn’t really get along. \n\nBut when our mom died, there were only two of her four kids in the will, me and my brother. The only reason this happened is because when she made the well, my brother and I were both still minors, our other two sisters were of age. Mom never changed it. I still made sure that all four of us got some of Mom’s belongings and precious things. There wasn’t a ton of money so that wasn’t divided. I included all four of us in the obituary because mom had four kids.\n\nSo I go look at the obituary and there is no mention of the two sisters. My brother, myself, and our little sister all lived in Florida while our eldest sister stayed in Illinois. Well, I guess when she died, her great grandchildren wanted to come back to Florida, my eldest sister did live here in Florida for a bit with her great grandchildren, and they wanted to stay with one of us. Both of us said no. These aren’t minor children, and they belong in Illinois where they have a support system.\n\nSo that is why we were not putting in the obituary. And it is insane because I got so many messages, when I finally went and looked about was that your sister because everyone knows there was four of us. I spent half my life in Illinois and it’s a pretty small town, so everyone knew there were four of us, and it looked crazy. That two of us were not in the obituary.\n\nI don’t know why, but it made me really upset. I went and got money out of the ATM and started to drive to where I used to cop drugs from. There was a park about halfway, it’s not a popular park.\nAnd it was Mother’s Day. I sat on a swing, and I screamed, hollered, sobbed, I had a breakdown. And then, like a child, I swang for over an hour. And then I was exhausted.\n\nI drove back home, gave my husband the money and told him what happened. And it scared me because that is the only time I’ve had a craving in over 10 years. I lost my mom, my brother was killed when he was on a bicycle and a driver hit him, both of those things were tragic and very unexpected but I didn’t have any cravings then and I love my mom and brother dearly. I don’t know why my sister said my cravings off, but she did.\n\nI am so glad I did not go through with it. \n\nI will also say that I have been in therapy for around eight years and I’m likely will be until I die and I’ve realized I’m OK with that. It’s better than going back to drugs.\nA lot of times you need to get to the root of the problem as to why you use, hence why therapy can go hand and hand with MAT’s.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767645956.0, "id": "nxvu0oc", "author": "Florida1974"}

The reason I got cleaned up was mostly due to mental health reasons because from an accomplishment perspective I was doing pretty well, lost 40 pounds in a year, holding a job, 3.8 gpa in my first semester of college, etc. \nThe thing is, my mental health isn’t getting much better, and one of the things that gets to me the most is immense guilt over some of the things I did while at my worst point in my use (when I was 17). This mostly involves having taken money from my Mom one time, some of the people I was around, stealing alcohol from my parents, some of my behaviors seeking validation from woman, etc. There’s some other stuff I’ve already confessed to my parents and tried to work through and they’ve been nothing but supportive and loving but some of the stuff like stealing a bit of money from my Mom is still getting to me and making me feel like I don’t deserve that love they give me. I try my best to show how grateful I am for them and how sorry I am for how much I worried them at times but it feels so hard for me to let go of the past at times. I’m trying to stop the loop of confessing stuff to them because it feeds into my ocd tendencies and just try and push forward and be a better me but it’s so hard. I feel awful and I love them so much. I’m in therapy but it’s not super consistent right now although I’ll start doing weekly appointments next Wednesday.

How can I learn to accept that I am trying my hardest to do better and I don’t know, maybe I’m just a shitty person, it’s hard to say.

For around 2 of those years I was going through about a gram cart a day. I quit cold turkey last February and made it 2 months sober, but the withdrawal depression was brutal. From what I learned during that time, my brain had basically stopped producing its own “feel-good” chemicals, so the crash wasn’t just feeling sad — it felt chemically empty.\n\nA few months ago I started tapering and got down to 3–5 sessions a day, which is much less than before. The past couple days I ran out of cart and money, so I was basically chasing whatever was left in the coil (which I know is bad — headaches and metal-fume type hits). Yesterday I only smoked 2 small sessions, and today I haven’t smoked yet and plan to wait until tonight.\n\nRight now I don’t feel great, but I also don’t feel that soul-crushing withdrawal depression, which is what I’m trying to avoid. In about a week I’m going to be forced to quit for 3 days for a drug test, and I’m not sure if I even want to go back after that.\n\nSo I’m looking for insight from anyone who’s been through something similar:\n\t•\tDoes once-a-day use until then actually help soften the withdrawal?\n\t•\tWill those 3 smoke-free days do anything meaningful for my brain?\n\t•\tIs there anything I might be misunderstanding about what’s going on chemically during tapering vs stopping?\n\nI’m just trying to cope and understand what’s happening in my brain so I can make the smartest decision going forward.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767640958.0, "id": "1q4v8pl", "author": "Evening-County8856", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q4v8pl/am_i_ready_to_quit/"}

I would really appreciate your time if you know the answer to this because I'm sick of this and if that's necessary then I want it. So my case is the following:\n-19M, been using it since I was 11\n- I had a huge religious transformation around 2.5 years ago, and I can almost say that overcame all of my sins and desires except this one. \n- I've tried so many ways to resist the temptation but have always failed.I've tried so many ways to fight off the temptation but eventually it gets to me. I know practical steps like leaving the place you're in or breaking the build up but that could work for a few days until there's a huge build up and I'm extremely tempted it's like I'm about to explode so eventually I fall back. And you could only avoid staying in bed alone tired bored etc for so long.\n- I'm not socially awkward or awkward around girls, though I avoid them for religious reasons. So negligible social effects. Maybe I have a bit low self confidence or an enforcing, powerful personality but this may or may not be because of my addiction. \n-  I could experience negative effects on studies (Pretty tough engineering school). Usually when I do it, because I'm overstimulated with dopamine, I get too lazy to study for the rest of the day . I also experience that if I doomscroll early in the morning so it's not a porn issue it's a dopamine one\n- Also recently I've been feeling that porn itself isnt amusing or it rarely is. Its the feeling of novelty and satisfying my curiosity that gets me. But in its essence i truly hate porn and everything associated with it. When I'm about to open it theres a voice that knows that this only ends in regret, and when i do open im not enjoying i only am when im searching for something new. \n-I feel like thankfully with God's grace I'm leading a good, well balanced, healthy and disciplined life apart from porn. I'm a good student in a good field in a high demand university, I have good friends and family, I go gym I literally have all a person my age would need. Again except porn it's my main and biggest problem.\nI really appreciate any advice on whether I should see a therapist or not, or what are the questions I should ask to know if I should, or whom to ask, and feel free to ask questions or dm.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "I'll paste what I wrote yesterday about this:\n\nI'm dealing with a cocaine habit currently. I quit smoking weed about 6 months ago as a 40-year-old that has smoked since they were 12. Not having weed to enhance my video gaming to fall back on has made this challenging to say the least. This is where I'm at with the process though...\n\nI don't think it's completely about giving yourself a bunch of reasons to not do it and then forcing that as your motivation. I think you also got to figure out the reasons why you choose to do it. Why are you doing it habitually? Obviously we do something, we enjoy it, we want to do it again. There's a difference between that and then experiencing something shitty and your first thought being, oh I need to smoke to relieve this pain. That's the addiction bullshit. It's the maladaptive coping mechanism aspect of it.\n\nWhen I learned at 12 years old that smoking weed makes all the abuse I was dealing with back then go away as soon as I fire up the playstation, that burns into the brain man, that fucks you up it really does. We don't learn how to control our emotions. We don't learn how to process trauma. We don't learn how to deal with problems head on the same way that other people do. So when you're trying to stop the weed, you're taking away the only tool you know how to use to feel better about life. Life is painful for everyone I don't give a fuck who you are, and if you say it's not you're lying. Life can also be boring at times and weed definitely fixes that, gotta learn to stay busy, figure out multiple hobbies.\n\nSo whenever you're taking that relief away it's a process. It's not as simple as just stopping with will, determination, and motivation; win the war not just that weeks battle. Obviously those are factors but this is a complicated and mechanical process. You need to break it down as a process and you need to form an understanding and a plan.\n\nYou need to understand your triggers, those are the things that make you want to smoke the most. Waking up, before and or after sex/porn, before or after you eat, before or after exercise, while gaming or watching TV or enhancing other entertainment, before bed, when you're pissed off, when you're really happy, etc. You got to start journaling this stuff and figuring out when you're weakest. You have to figure out when it's the hardest to say no. Then as you understand those, you can reinforce your defenses and adjust to responding differently a bit better.\n\nCannabis is tough actually because it's mentally and behaviorally addictive, not chemically. In my opinion mentally and behaviorally is much harder to deal with and yes, I have been addicted to opiates and cocaine. Obviously there's a mental and behavioral aspect to all addiction but for my circumstance, cannabis at a young age and becoming that coping mechanism for trauma when I was dealing with abuse, that was one of the worst addictions for me to overcome to be honest. I overcame it a long time ago, like I could quit when I wanted to but it remained a way to relieve pain instead of processing bullshit correctly for most of my life. I quit 6 months ago because I need to get a better job and I've just kind of chilled off of it for other reasons like developing spiritual stuff and wanting to clear my head out etc. I imagine I will smoke again but right now I'm actually working more on the exact process I'm explaining to you so I can use it for all substance abuse issues, not just trees.\n\nIf you want to talk to me, even just to rant or express yourself, just drop me a line on here. I did 3 months inpatient as a teenager because I was on probation and literally said fuck this shit I'm not quitting smoking weed I don't care what you do. Well they sent me to rehab for cannabis which is pretty funny LOL. I have a little insight and there's definitely methods out there that work for getting sober, just have to apply some structure with your effort.\n\nSo to recap...\n\n-Start journaling when you say fuck it and smoke and why that happened. You have to create like this science-based structure to this, this needs to be documented so your individual process can be improved. That's what I meant as far as your triggers.\n\n-Figure out how to replace the relief you got from the Cannabis with other things. If people tell you try meditation, trust me put that to the side for now, definitely start with exercise or physical activity first. Meditation is not the best FIRST step for everybody and sometimes can actually be damaging for people with certain mental framework. If you have no idea how to relieve with any kind of hobby or activity or pleasure that's therapeutic, just exercise even if it's just going for walks.\n\n-Remember: you are reprogramming your brain in a serious and fundamental way. This happens with repetition. Your work and sacrificie is going to feel the least effective and this will feel most challenging in the beginning. You will have to put the most mental effort and maintain emotional control and discipline in the beginning. I promise you that it gets easier faster than you realize. Just getting past the first week can really cement you with enough momentum to get it done. This is important to remember. You're not just quitting smoking cannabis, you are learning to not rely on a substance as a coping tool. You have to create those tools and reactions to process bullshit, and especially boredom, using your own mental and physical faculties.\n\nYou got this homie, hmu if you want to talk about the process or just to bullshit.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767631218.0, "id": "nxucdu9", "author": "GeminiKoil"}

I need guidance on how to quit.", "text": "My case began about 10 years ago when I started consuming adult content occasionally. Little by little, it turned into compulsive self-stimulation, sometimes multiple times a day.\n\nAbout two years ago, I began to feel the consequences in my sexual performance and mental health. I realized that I had conditioned myself to need extreme stimulation, and I also struggled with control and connection during intimacy because I was used to very fast, overstimulated release.\n\nToday I feel like I’m in a hole that I’m not proud of. At first, the content I consumed was relatively common, but over time, it escalated into more specific and intense material. Over the last year, I became obsessed with ts content, that now feels like the only thing that activates me.\n\nThis escalation didn’t stay only online. In my country, access to this \"market\" of paid adult encounters through the internet is very easy. At first, I only browsed those sites, jerk off, and then felt a lot of regret. But over time, this evolved to the point where I actually went through with it and had encounters in real life.\n\nI’ve done this three times in the last year, and every single time I end up feeling deeply depressed about myself, the person I’ve become, the money I waste from my work, and the loss of self-respect. Each time, I see it as an extreme situation and a final warning — a reason to stop for good — but somehow I always return to the same behavior.\n\nWhat scares me the most is that a few years ago, this was something completely distant and surreal to me, totally against my principles and my sense of self-care. I still don’t fully understand how I crossed that line.\n\nNowadays, I try to force myself to shut down these thoughts completely. Health risks scare me and sometimes help me stop, but I still get very close. I’m stuck in a vicious cycle: I see a triggering image online, then I start searching and searching, going deeper and deeper into that type of content, until I end up on dating or hookup platforms looking for validation or contact. Many times I don’t actually go through with anything, but even then, I end up feeling fear, regret, and shame afterward.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve had good streaks, but I always go back. I feel trapped in this cycle, and any advice or guidance would help me a lot.\n\nGreetings from Colombia, and thanks for reading.", "score": 18, "num_comments": 10, "created_utc": 1767566720.0, "id": "1q443v7", "author": "JuanDavidFerro", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q443v7/i_have_been_watching_pornography_since_i_was_16/"}

Not having weed to enhance my video gaming to fall back on has made this challenging to say the least. This is where I'm at with the process though...\n\nI don't think it's completely about giving yourself a bunch of reasons to not do it and then forcing that as your motivation. I think you also got to figure out the reasons why you choose to do it. Why are you doing it habitually? Obviously we do something, we enjoy it, we want to do it again. There's a difference between that and then experiencing something shitty and your first thought being, oh I need to smoke to relieve this pain. That's the addiction bullshit. It's the maladaptive coping mechanism aspect of it.\n\nWhen I learned at 12 years old that smoking weed makes all the abuse I was dealing with back then go away as soon as I fire up the playstation, that burns into the brain man, that fucks you up it really does. We don't learn how to control our emotions. We don't learn how to process trauma. We don't learn how to deal with problems head on the same way that other people do. So when you're trying to stop the weed, you're taking away the only tool you know how to use to feel better about life. Life is painful for everyone I don't give a fuck who you are, and if you say it's not you're lying. Life can also be boring at times and weed definitely fixes that, gotta learn to stay busy, figure out multiple hobbies.\n\nSo whenever you're taking that relief away it's a process. It's not as simple as just stopping with will, determination, and motivation; win the war not just that weeks battle. Obviously those are factors but this is a complicated and mechanical process. You need to break it down as a process and you need to form an understanding and a plan.\n\nYou need to understand your triggers, those are the things that make you want to smoke the most. Waking up, before and or after sex/porn, before or after you eat, before or after exercise, while gaming or watching TV or enhancing other entertainment, before bed, when you're pissed off, when you're really happy, etc. You got to start journaling this stuff and figuring out when you're weakest. You have to figure out when it's the hardest to say no. Then as you understand those, you can reinforce your defenses and adjust to responding differently a bit better.\n\nCannabis is tough actually because it's mentally and behaviorally addictive, not chemically. In my opinion mentally and behaviorally is much harder to deal with and yes, I have been addicted to opiates and cocaine. Obviously there's a mental and behavioral aspect to all addiction but for my circumstance, cannabis at a young age and becoming that coping mechanism for trauma when I was dealing with abuse, that was one of the worst addictions for me to overcome to be honest. I overcame it a long time ago, like I could quit when I wanted to but it remained a way to relieve pain instead of processing bullshit correctly for most of my life. I quit 6 months ago because I need to get a better job and I've just kind of chilled off of it for other reasons like developing spiritual stuff and wanting to clear my head out etc. I imagine I will smoke again but right now I'm actually working more on the exact process I'm explaining to you so I can use it for all substance abuse issues, not just trees.\n\nIf you want to talk to me, even just to rant or express yourself, just drop me a line on here. I did 3 months inpatient as a teenager because I was on probation and literally said fuck this shit I'm not quitting smoking weed I don't care what you do. Well they sent me to rehab for cannabis which is pretty funny LOL. I have a little insight and there's definitely methods out there that work for getting sober, just have to apply some structure with your effort.\n\nSo to recap...\n\n-Start journaling when you say fuck it and smoke and why that happened. You have to create like this science-based structure to this, this needs to be documented so your individual process can be improved. That's what I meant as far as your triggers.\n\n-Figure out how to replace the relief you got from the Cannabis with other things. If people tell you try meditation, trust me put that to the side for now, definitely start with exercise or physical activity first. Meditation is not the best FIRST step for everybody and sometimes can actually be damaging for people with certain mental framework. If you have no idea how to relieve with any kind of hobby or activity or pleasure that's therapeutic, just exercise even if it's just going for walks.\n\n-Remember: you are reprogramming your brain in a serious and fundamental way. This happens with repetition. Your work and sacrificie is going to feel the least effective and this will feel most challenging in the beginning. You will have to put the most mental effort and maintain emotional control and discipline in the beginning. I promise you that it gets easier faster than you realize. Just getting past the first week can really cement you with enough momentum to get it done. This is important to remember. You're not just quitting smoking cannabis, you are learning to not rely on a substance as a coping tool. You have to create those tools and reactions to process bullshit, and especially boredom, using your own mental and physical faculties.\n\nYou got this homie, hmu if you want to talk about the process or just to bullshit.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1767562114.0, "id": "nxp667y", "author": "GeminiKoil"}

Dont beat yourself up if you do, its hard. Just because weed isnt fent doesnt mean its harmless and not affecting you. \n\nI’ve actually slid backwards several times, but what helps me:\n1. Make friends with people who arent smoking frequently or who you feel safe saying “idgaf if you smoke but im trying to quit, please dont bring it around me if possible”\n2. Replace weed with something else. I used to hate when people recommended the gym but its sick.

I’ve been in MAT (methadone) for ten years now. I was clean for a while, slipped back and forth. And was using alongside my medication from 2020-2024. I’m over a year and a half fully clean. And finally titrating my methadone dose. \n\nI’ve been dealing with what many people do after long term use and treatment, managing pain and life in an opiate-heavy analgesic medical landscape. \n\nI just had extensive dental surgery, and my surgeon tried to prescribe me some 5mg oxycodone along with Tylenol and ibuprofen. It obviously didn’t do anything. My tolerance from my methadone prescription is high. \n\nI asked is there anything that wouldn’t need to come up against my tolerance? Something mechanically or chemically different from opiates with pain relief? They said maybe this new drug: Journavx. It’s brand new, expensive, but it’s not an opiate. \n\nI took this medicine and it’s a miracle. With a savings card from the medication site the price went from $327 for the bottle to $30. Godsend.\n\nIt blocked my pain signals WITHOUT the reward mechanism opiates give. I don’t feel high or altered, the pain is just GONE. It literally feels like this could help alter a major path for opioid dependence, pain management without dependence and withdrawal. \n\nApparently it only came around in 2024, so it’s still really new. But I want to share this with others who may be struggling. Pain management after surgery or injury is so hard to navigate for those of us with SUD and opiate addiction history. Adding the stigma on top where medical professionals half the time just treat us as if we’re drug-seeking when we’re truly in pain. \n\nI’m not giving any medical advice of course, but the more people who know this option exists, the more people can talk to their doctors about these kinds of pathways for pain management that aren’t opiate based or reward-based for your brain. \n\nI hope this post is allowed because I want to share what feels like an honest to god miracle to me.

I was an addict for many years, but I have been clean from everything since 2020. However heroin and then fentanyl were my drugs of choice.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "First off: huge respect for how you handled this. You didn’t use, you didn’t rationalize, you involved another person in recovery, and you destroyed it immediately. That’s not luck — that’s growth and real recovery.\n\nNow let’s separate the emotional shock from the actual risk.\n\nWhat happened is understandably triggering, especially given your history. Anyone with your background would feel shaken. But the fact that your mind went to “how do I protect my life and recovery?” instead of “how do I use?” says a lot.\n\nA few grounded points:\n\n1. You are not in danger right now.\nYou did the right thing by getting rid of it immediately. There’s no ongoing legal exposure from that moment forward. The fear you’re feeling now is aftershock + old wiring.\n\n2. This is extremely rare.\nMillions of rides happen every day. People drop phones, keys, weed pens — hard drugs like that are not common. Your brain is understandably catastrophizing because of your past, not because this is likely to repeat.\n\n3. Do NOT report yourself to the police.\nYou did nothing wrong, but as a felon, unnecessary contact with law enforcement is almost never a good idea. There’s no upside for you there.\n\n4. Reporting to Uber is optional — and neutral.\nIf you do report, keep it vague and factual:\n\n“I found an unknown substance after a ride and disposed of it safely. I’m concerned about rider safety and my own.”\n\nNo accusations. No rider names. No details. This protects you without escalating anything.\n\n5. A rear-facing interior camera is actually a smart move.\nNot from fear — from documentation. Many drivers use them. It:\n\t•\tProtects you legally\n\t•\tDiscourages bad behavior\n\t•\tGives peace of mind\n\nThat’s a reasonable boundary, not paranoia.\n\n6. Don’t make a big life decision while activated.\nYou don’t need to quit Uber today. Let your nervous system settle for a few days. If later you decide it’s not worth the stress, that’s fine — but don’t decide while adrenaline is still high.\n\nThe most important thing here:\n\nYou didn’t lose anything today.\nYou protected everything you’ve built.\n\nThis was a test you didn’t ask for — and you passed it.\n\nTalk it out with recovery people. Ground yourself. Tighten safeguards if it helps you feel safe. But don’t let one freak incident erase six years of proof that you’re not who you used to be.\n\nYou handled this exactly how someone in solid recovery handles it.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767735926.0, "id": "ny32g5m", "author": "ahandel2892"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "addiction", "title": "Help with long term co-codamol addiction", "text": "Hi everyone. I'll start this with a synopsis of my relationship with Co-codamol. I am a male in my early 30's living in the UK. I was prescribed 30/500 co-codamol after surgery from a sporting injury when I was around 15. I loved how it made me feel and ever since then, I have always found ways to obtain it. I won't go into detail here, but I am now at a point where I can obtain an infinite amount. \n\nI know I am addicted to them and have known for years, I have tried stopping so many times, but I just can't. For around the last 7 years I have taken co-codamol daily. The Co-codamol also helps calm my bowel as I suffer with Ulcerative colitis, which is another reason I take them.\n\nI only learned about CWE today, so for around 7 years I have been taking paracetamol nearly every day, however, this is where my addiction is slightly different to most, I never take more than 2 tablets every 4 hours. At the moment I am taking 2 tablets once or twice daily, sometimes 3 times a day. I also dont drink alocohol the same day as taking them.\n\nI have found myself avoiding most social events over the past few years as I just want to stay in the house and take Co-codamol. I am married and my wife knows I take co-codamol daily, but she does not know I can't stop taking them. I don't think she realises I am addicted, and thinks they're doing more good than harm as they help with my gastrointestinal issues. However, I am worried of the long term damage to my liver and kidneys, my LFT's are usually ok, my ALT does come slightly high every now and then, but it doesnt go drastically high. I have regular blood tests due to the immunotherapy I am taking for my Ulcerative colitis.\n\nTaking the co-codamol is always on my mind though, I work full time and don't take it whilst working, but as soon as I finish I take 2, I find I can't relax until I take them. It's also made me lazy, I dont want to do anything bar take Co-codamol. I don't really get high off the co-codamol anymore, and I am not tempted to take more than 2 at a time, but I just can't relax without taking it. \n\nI have always had an addictive personality, and recently been diagnosed with ADHD as I have been attending CBT for the past 2 months as I have always suffered with quite bad anxiety and depression (which is usually made a lot better when taking co-codamol). The ADHD explains a lot and is probably a large contributing factor to my addiction. \n\nI just want a bit of advice really, if anyone has been in the same situation and how they managed to stop using.\n\nThanks :)", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767541891.0, "id": "1q3ta3a", "author": "Jumpy-Reason-7724", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q3ta3a/help_with_long_term_cocodamol_addiction/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "For many people who develop addictive personality it doesn't come out of nowhere and almost always developers later in life as a compensatory adaptation to some deficiency or untreated issue, then that's the root cause and treating the underlying problem will stop the brain from using those adaptations and workarounds which result in the form of addictive personality. It is your brain trying to fix the underlying problem, but it's not very accurate and often the adaptations are maladaptive, they do more harm than good, like make people develop severe additions. \n\nTherefore the problem is not the cocodamol and if you try the outdated approach of simply depriving yourself from the drug to fix yourself, it won't help much. Because even if you recover physical withdrawal, you will still be suffering mentally constantly and your brain literally tries to amplify the addictive personality features. The brain thinks it's helping you by doing this, even tho it makes you develop addictions. Nearly all of our diseases and disorders are not caused by some foreign toxic thing but our own brain when it tries to fix itself by throwing a wrench at itself.\n\nTherefore, you have to really think what the codeine is compensating for you. Opioids substitute for unmet emotional need and masks the mental dysphoria and understimulatiom that results in severe cravings.\n\nJust stopping codeine is only part of the solution. If you're sober but suffering, it's only a matter of time before you get tired of saying no and succumb to relapse. Not because you're weak, but because of overload and chronic exhaustion.\n\nIn that sense - it's unfair to punish or blame yourself for failing to be sober and for eventually relapsing after a few weeks of sobriety. Your brain literally thinks you need this relief, so it helps orient you towards it even when you resist by trying to be abstaining sober. It thinks youre not sure what you're doing and straying away from the solution - so it reorients you, bypassing your conscious choice and willpower because they're interfering with this. The brain thinks it's trying to prevent you from making a mistake error \n\nWhen you try to fight your own brain in the middle of cascade it's impossible to resist. Once it decides something is “necessary,” it can bypass your conscious choice completely. So after a certain point, it’s not really fair to blame yourself for relapsing. Your impulse control isn’t at 100 percent anymore, and you end up doing stuff you don’t want and regret. That part isn’t your fault.\n\nRelapse starts way before it feels like a decision. Certain cues, stress, places, moods, get wired into your dopamine learning pathways. Once those circuits fire, the habit system takes over and your brakes basically turn off. At that point it’s barely a choice at all.\n\nTrying to resist in the middle of that cascade just burns you out. You’re wasting energy where you have almost no control. The real leverage is earlier, learning what flips that first switch for you and stopping it there. If that pathway never fires, the spiral never starts, and that’s where you actually get your control back.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767603639.0, "id": "nxsdr4r", "author": "Rude_Lengthiness_101"}

It was a super fast very sexually charged relationship but I loved him a lot and despite his cocaine addiction and other issues he deals with, he loved me too in his own way. We were both not emotionally ok whatsoever at the time either. We went out of each others lives but would always come back into each others orbit at times. I spent a lot of time with him in 2024 and last year we rekindled a relationship after he did a 3 month stay at rehab. He’s been to rehab many times. We had a week or two of some real happiness together and then he relapsed again and went back to his ex girlfriend who is also an addict. I moved a few towns over last summer and then saw on FB a few months ago he was back in prison again. He looked close to death, and I’ve seen him that way a few times but this was hard to see. I contacted him and now we talk almost everyday and he’s grateful to me for being there for him and helping him out a little get stuff he needs. I’m not naive and I know him well but I’m still hopeful for some recovery and maybe a real future with him. We have an amazing soul connection. I just want to really maintain some seriousness with him because I am really all he has in the way of a good supportive person. He needs a lot of support from people who aren’t addicts. He also needs to not be sent back to Newark NJ, a place where an addict basically has a very slim chance of recovery. I don’t think he’s getting out of prison until next fall either as of right now.

They are just young and can handle drinking. So I will not cut them off as I did with my junky-friends last time. They are acctually good for me and a driving force to why I wanna change. So that I can grow old and spend many more years with them. \n\n\n\nA buddy of mine invited me to a dinner yesterday, he made really good ramen and we had a great time. They drank wine, I drank Doctor pepper. They played music, we discussed Tolkien and had a great time. Then we went to a bar, at first I thought of just going home, scared to get triggered, but it actually went okay. I ordered cola. They drank beer, I stayed until half past one in the morning and then went home - 100% sober. \n\n\n\nThis gives me some hope I wont become isolated, that I could go to a bar and not drink. But i know this is a gamble, its a risk going to bar or party. On a bad day I could slip up, 100%. I dont wanna rot at home every weekend because they are hanging at a bar and I cant join them. \n\n\n\nI wanted to drink yesterday, found myself looking at they wine or beerglas longing like a fucking cliché - but I didnt wanna fuck up my resolution 4 days in. I dont wanna fuck up again as ive done so many times over and over again. Feels like my life is a series of fuckups and I have nothing to show for it. But I wanna have something to show for it, I wanna accomplish stuff, see the world, love, have kids, have a career. \n\n\n\nSorry for the short story, gonna stop now and work on my novel instead. Thanks for reading.

Take it day by day, with just one goal in mind for that day. That, and you need to get out of your house.\n\nDo not let your brain fool you, that’s exactly what it wants you to do.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "What you're experiencing is called immaturity, and it's the mountain that many recovering addicts have to climb. The reality is, life is full of pain and disappointment. Part of becoming a mature person is learning how to navigate the physical, mental, and emotional challenges of life. And as you get older, life becomes more and more challenging. When you start running away from these challenges with drugs, gambling, or whatever, you stop maturing. The younger your addiction begins, the less mature you are when you finally decide to quit. So if you become addicted at 13 and finally stop at 35, you're dealing with 35-year-old level problems with the maturity of a 13 year old.\n\nI don't know how old you are now, but most people don't become addicted at 13, so you probably have a much greater challenge than most recovering addicts. You have a lot of catch up to do. Two years may not be long enough, and if you aren't doing the hard work of building your maturity and ability to navigate life, you may never catch up to your age.\n\nThis isn't the whole story of addiction.

My mom's younger brother does not talk to my mom's younger sister almost ever because they won't agree politically. \n\nLike me, my mom's younger sister is a hard right wing Republican, as is my uncle from West Cleveland. \n\nMy Mom, her brother from East Cleveland and my grandma all HATE Trump, however My Mom's Sister, West Cleveland Uncle and I Love Him. \n\nMy mom will always criticize me for swearing, even though she swears herself. \n\nShe will criticize my tone of voice when I unintentionally said something in the wrong tong of voice and then the conversation turns into an argument. Then she becomes extremely unpleasant and I absolutely hate being around here. \n\nI wish you all the best but I hope I don't turn out to be anything like her. I think she's a truly horrible human being but because she's my mother I'd get criticized if I said too many things bad about her. \n\nThere should be nothing wrong with hating your family. \n\nI know I may have went off topic with my mom but, because she sent me a good-bye text, it is now everyone in the family, as my dad and two older brothers stopped talking to me around May 2025, I only seen my dad once since in October and my brother's none. \n\nWhen watching save it Private Ryan, when it goes to the scene of recalling his brother's faces, it's kind of like the same thing for me. They're hard to picture, but I have many good memories with my brother's. \n\nExcept I didn't lose my brothers to war, I lost them to addiction instead of them losing me to a premature departure. Substance abuse is known to affect one's health and expected life span. \n\nAlcohol ruined the relationship with Family, along with Weed. I should have quit both substances of very long time ago but didn't. I also have CHS, and all of my closest friends, some two dozen or so, stopped hanging out with me long before the alcohol problem got involved. \n\nMy life really went downhill in 2019, that's when the roller coaster dropped. Ironically the last time I rode a roller coaster was in 2019, wouldn't have been able to do it the next year... \n\n\n", "score": 0, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767517930.0, "id": "1q3lfpe", "author": "camport95", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q3lfpe/was_quitting_weed_or_alcohol_harder_for_you/"}

There appears to be a systemic \"Bait-and-Switch\" between the facility's public-facing support of relationships and the punitive tactics used behind closed doors.\n\nPatterns of Concern:\n\nThe Internal Rumor Mill: In this \"close quarters\" environment, personal dynamics are often exposed and spread to the entire community within minutes. This creates a high-surveillance atmosphere where residents are pressured to monitor one another.\n\nThe \"Lethal\" Office Ultimatum: Reports from the community indicate that staff bring residents into private offices—away from witnesses—and deliver a psychological \"shakedown.\" Residents are reportedly told that staying with their partner \"will kill the other person.\" \n\nThe \"Success-to-Crisis\" Pivot: There are documented instances of senior residents who were thriving, meeting all milestones, and participating fully in the program, only to be subjected to these office ultimatums regarding off-site support systems.\n\nThe Clinical Crash: Following these forced separations and the threat of immediate, no-appeal expulsion, these residents often experience a total physiological and emotional crash. This intervention trades long-term stability for acute crisis.\n\nThe Alumni Pipeline: This \"lethal\" rhetoric is then reportedly leaked by staff and alumni into the broader recovery community to ensure the individual is socially policed and exiled from outside peer support.\n\nQuestions for the Community:\n\nIs \"immediate removal with no appeal\" for a relationship status considered an evidence-based practice in 2026?\n\nHow does telling a resident—in a private office—that their love is \"lethal\" align with Dr. Gabor Maté’s research on the biological necessity of connection in addiction recovery?\n\nAt what point does a \"safety policy\" become psychological coercion?\n\nLink to the reel https://www.facebook.com/reel/123456789", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767517061.0, "id": "1q3l74d", "author": "No-Result-7651", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q3l74d/clinical_ethics_in_recovery_the_use_of_lethal/"}

My family took me out when they saw the condition I was in.\n\nWhile I was there, I had to eat leftovers from other people’s plates, sometimes dig through the trash to find food, and I was forced to hug and sleep next to one of the leaders to get “benefits” and avoid punishment. He manipulated me with fear and many other things because I was terrified.\n\nBefore going in, I had a partner. During my first visit, my mother told me that my partner had spoken to her and ended the relationship. I understood it. It still hurt, but I had already been dealing with that since I arrived there.\n\nWhen I got out, I contacted a friend I considered one of my closest. She confessed to me the things she told my ex, things she claimed I had supposedly said. Then she told me that things wouldn’t have ended badly if she had been with my partner instead of me. She also said bad things happened to her while I was locked up there. And yes, bad things did happen, but…\n\nWhat bothers me is that I just lowered my head. I didn’t defend myself or try to explain anything. I only wrote a message apologizing for those things and asked her to send it to my ex. I know I acted that way because of where I came from: I was used to not defending myself, just accepting blame no matter what and keeping my head down. I regret it.\n\nI lost the few good friends I had, family members, my father, and a partner I truly loved. Because I didn’t have the courage to express myself or defend myself against what was said about me, I lost them forever. This feels like the last chance I have in life before my mother leaves me too.\n\nToday I work 10-hour shifts, Monday to Sunday, making pizzas. At work I talk a little with my coworkers, even if it’s just casual. They smoke, and sometimes they offer me some, and I tell them I already quit without going into details. I don’t feel tempted, but I’m afraid my mother might think I started smoking again and either kick me out or send me back to rehab. I barely reached the age of majority in my country. I feel alone, bad, stupid. I know all of this is my fault, but why? I can’t sleep well and I panic at the thought of going back to that rehabilitation house. I need to talk to people.\n\nI have problems and fears I didn’t have before, but at least I don’t use drugs anymore.

My problems==my responsability.(I went and told anyone who started becoming a friend what kinds of things triggered me so they could at least notice and, at their own choice ask if im good. Though part is being open to say and listen)\n\nAs for the Shame.\nDo not torture yourself with regret, whats done is done, only whats TO DO is worth your attention. Be good to yourself, youre the only one that can be expected to take care of yourself, the others have their own lives to navigate.\n\nI hope this helps you a bit at least.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767500467.0, "id": "nxkijdm", "author": "Mysterious-Gear8286"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "Addiction isnt just about will power. You were ready to stop. That's great. People forget though that theres an actual entire biology to addiction and the substances you were addicted to absolutely play a part. All addiction is behavioral with varying degrees of biological rewiring and interaction. Anyone in here thinking they're \"weak\" for not keeping their DOC at bedside, dont look at it like that. It isnt accurate. Theres always an exception to every rule. Theres always a person who just made the decision to stop and was able to without MAT, rehab, and soberliving. Theres always the person who didnt have as bad of a  withdrawal period. Theres always the person that a certain maintenence med doesnt work for. Etc etc,  Because...addiction is very much bio-psycho-social thing that isnt expressed the same in everyone based on their biology, psychology and social experiences. \n\nGood for OP, they have an unusual approach. My preferred approach isnt white knuckling to build discipline. What worked for me was spiritual transformation working on the reasons why I used and sorting out my biology. It takes 60ish days to break a habit and 90ish days for neural rewiring to restructure on a new habit. It can take years to rewire the striatum where your reward circuitry is and years to change your social behaviors and do spiritual development.  There is no time line for anyone and no tested and true method that works for anyone. \n\nAnyone doing whatever they can to get off a substance and break the cycle of addiction...fuck yea and kudos to you even if your approaches are unconventional. If you're new to it though (getting clean) especially on any highly addictive substances with severe biological consequences like opioids and benzos,  I HIGHLY advise you try evidence based methods before anything else. \n\nI feel someone must say this because im seeing the comments littered with individuals thinking they're too weak because they wouldn't succeed using that approach. OP mentions its unconventional though and they know that. Dont beat yourself up or bring further shame on yourselves. Those thought patterns are what  keeps you stuck. \n\nAnd to OP, congrats on not using and character building etc.  Just a gentle reminder to make sure you put as much mental effort into the psycho-social parts of your addiction too so your recovery continues to develop!

I have no intentions to belittle you struggles and equate them to mine. But, All the other subs (pornography addiction related subs) have deleted this post, and I need to be accountable to someone. I am genuinely sorry if this post disrespects the journey of the members of the sub.\n\n\n\nHey everyone, I saw it (don't wanna use the word) for the first time when I was 16. I didn't even hear about it till I was 15. I came to know about it through a video about its addiction(I used to jerk off regularly back then, though). lol, Ig my journey is going in reverse. Anyways, I used to watch it regularly. in 2021, when I was 17 I discovered sissy stuff. I was addicted to it instantly. I barely had any friends ever since I was a kid(I am not introvert or anti-social, but, I didn't have friends who liked me back until I was 18. I don't blame them, I was an asshole too), let alone having female friends. so, I was always curious about how girls grew up,and I don't really have great relations with my mother(only woman in my life), she often acts too immature, she barely has any personality. Talking to her feels like talking to 14 y/o. Coming back to the topic, I was hooked on the sissy stuff. According to my interpretation, I think I was trying to fill up that void of femininity in my life with sissy stuff online, I started to believe I was one myself. Plus, I was obese(low-key still am, which makes my body a bit curvy) back then, and creeps online gave me the validation and validation I never got. My unhealthy body was addressed as hot, and seductive by them. Btw, I starting posting nudes when I was 18 and still do it (at least, until an hour ago).\n\nThe gooning has gone very wild, I start gooning on the slightest hint of boredom. I can't get my penis erect anymore. Forgot to mention this, I am also insecure about my dick size, which also drove me to humiliation, degradation, cuckold and other weird stuff.\n\nI have never told this to anyone, and I don't know if this is a factor in all this, or not. But, when I was 10 and my brother was 16, he used to make out me (pretty sensually). he did it for a week, but never did it again. I don't know if it bothers me or not, because we have a great relationship now. He is one of the few people, I'd  happily die for, and he was just a horny teen back then. Tbh, I have no clue, why am I even mention it here, maybe I am just trying to be a victim and take the easy way out. If you are wondering, we never addressed it.\n\nWhen I think about it, every single problem in my life can be solved, if I stop doing this. If I workout for a couple of months, I can get really attractive. I read a lot, I am doing decently academically(by decent, I mean I am not failing my classes). There is a girl that I adore, I have a feeling she is into me as well. But, I have never approached her, because which girl would like to be with a guy can't get his genital to work, and sends predators his nudes and crossdresses in his mum's clothes. But, the truth is I don't have dreams without her in them anymore. She's the personification of everything I need in this life to be happy.\n\nThis reminds me of another thing, Reading my post you might think I am gay. But, the truth is, I don't know. I am like 85% sure I am going through HOCD(Homosexual Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder). I could be wrong, but I've never been romantically attracted to a guy, maybe it's a hormonal thing that I fantasize about getting railed by them. Idk, all I know is I feel horrible. I have issues walking in public. I love swimming, but I don't go to pool, because of my feminine body that I hate, but is validated by assholes online. I am not blaming them, after all it's my loser ass, who sends it to them.\n\nI really love learning, I always have, but this addiction makes me feel complacent, and has completely taken the drive to do anything in my life. I have no idea how many horribly degrading things I have heard, and even said, about myself and my family members. If, these things get public, I would be seen as a monster out on the streets. I am ashamed of myself. My self-control, accountability, self-respect are less than Man-united's wins.\n\nI remember being called a prodigy, often, as a kid, but, It's like a beautiful memory now. I am no where near my potential. I am sorry If I am bragging too much, My motive is not to tell you how awesome I am, I genuinely don't think I deserve anything (especially at this point of my life).But Ig, anonymity helps in the pursuit of being an asshole. The things I have lost to this addiction are much more concerning than my erection. I remember, when my grandfather died, all I did was jerk off, all day. I mean, the person I loved and respected the most in this world was no more in this world, and I didn't mourn a blink. I feel awful, that I jerked off even than. Addiction has not just taken away my sanctity and sanity, but also my humanity.\n\nI don't wanna feel this way anymore. I wanna get back to be that kid was before 2018.\n\nI have never stayed sober(I don't if that's the correct word given, the context) for more than 3 days, so this is my next target: stay sober until 8th  January 3:33 AM.  I'll write again if I accomplish it (as if, someone's waiting for it, lol).\n\nIf you've made it this far, you have no idea what it means to me. Thank you so much. I have created so many reddit accounts for my addiction, this is my first one to quit it. I hope this would be my last one as well.\n\nThank you guys, I hope you accomplish everything you want in life .\n\nPs: Adventure of a lifetime, by Coldplay is a great song to write a blog.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767479395.0, "id": "1q3887t", "author": "[deleted]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/1q3887t/its_been_an_hour_i_hope_i_dont_get_there_ever/"}

Before I start, this is not supposed to be a dig at those that utilize the drug, I understand its place in medicine and for those just looking to relax. I just feel it is holding me back and I do not want to lean on it anymore.\n\nTo start, I haven’t smoked for 3 days, the longest i’ve gone in quite some time. I am preparing for life-altering exams and just an overall hard semester with school, and I just want to be at my most clear state of mind for these events. Now, while my girlfriend of 2 years is not a smoker, she never had a vocal issue with my usage (although I could tell it always bugged her). She has been by my side through some of the hardest points in my life, but this time it feels off. I I was venting to her about the symptoms I have experienced since stopping (deep sadness, irritation, and anxiety) and all she had to say was “thats what happens when you’re addicted to something” and “you will survive”. \n\nNow, I have always had chronic depression (diagnosed) and weed has been my vice as I have a personal issue with prescription medication (a stubbornness that runs in my family) so to hear her regard my symptoms in such a way hurts. I feel isolated and I do not understand why she would act this way.

You’re young, and it’s a great time to start your future. Even if marijuana has medial benefits, jobs don’t recognize that yet, and it’s safer to be clean while you find something that will give you a good foundation.\n\nAddiction can be from anything, and I can’t say whether you were addicted or not. I’m just saying that too much of anything can be bad. If you feel like it’s holding you back, it might be time to drop it, even if it’s temporary and then maybe returning to it, you might have better control. And at least you know that you have that self control.\n\nI had to stop weed cold turkey recently because I am pregnant, and it wasn’t easy, but personally, I feel that the guilt smoking while pregnant is heavier than the craving. I just personally would rather not smoke while carrying a child simply because it hasn’t been studied enough. That is my personal choice. Time went on, and sometimes I miss it, but it gets easier everyday. I just have to find other way to manage my anxiety and my sleep because that’s what I primarily used it for.\n\nThe hard part is when people you love don’t support you.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "addiction", "title": "She’s almost convinced me I’m clean while she’s giving me, subs, z drugs and amphetamine. Am I going crazy?", "text": "I can give myself credit for having come a long way the past two years. Before I was sentenced, I had absolutely no motivation to change my lifestyle, and I was lucky enough to be sent to a treatment facility instead of prison. At the end, I was taking extreme amounts of benzos, heroin, and speed every day, the WD got dangerous. Addiction healthcare where I live is absolute shit, so I went through seizures, delirium tremens, and all that more or less on my own.\n\nBefore the detox facility I was on 100mg of alprazolam, and lots of clonazepam a day (how unreal that even may sound I have no reason to lie, took me years and years to mess up my tolerance on that level)\n\nBefore my first seizure the doctor had prescribed me a 2 week taper, I was down to 0 in 2 months after many years on benzodiazepines.\n\nTook me about 4 months in the rehab to realize I I’ve even want to change. Had forgot everything there is about life before the pills and heroine.\n\nStill feels insane how I’m one of the luckiest people alive, survived more overdoses than I even remember. And one of the best people I ever knew lost his life the first time.\n\nSo yea, I can give myself I have come a long way…\n\nBut:\n\nToday I’m in OST and take 16 mg of Subutex, 7.5 mg zopiclone, and 70 mg Vyvanse. According to healthcare, I’m now considered “clean.” My nurse always tells me how impressed she is, and she’s right when she says I wouldn’t be alive today if I had continued using benzos and heroin. Still, I keep asking myself if there really is such a big difference between then and now, apart from the risk of overdosing on fentanyl.\n\nI tell myself that if I were a stronger person who truly wanted to get clean, I wouldn’t need any of this. That thinking makes me misuse my prescriptions. I believe my doctor understands, but sees it as better than me going back to the criminal side of addiction—especially with how harsh drug laws has become over here.\n\nSo as I said. Compared to how my life used to look, I’m doing better. But I don’t feel better, at least not anymore. OST keeps me alive, but it also makes me stuck in life. I miss my younger self—the creativity, the energy, producing music, painting and etc. I were into all kinds of art, just as where heavily into the rave/techno scene where I lived and grew up. Had sooo mutch fun, and I miss everyone in our group of friends, just as they were back then! Things could have worked out so different! And i can be so damn sad thinking about how fast people changed! Some due to the money and that damn mentality you need if you want to make it in that world. Or, and others including myself due to addiction.\n\nNow my life is about clinic visits and just feeling “okay.” I’m grateful to be alive, but I’m past that. I want to move on.\n\nI really want to quit Subutex, but I’m terrified of relapsing and overdosing. I know I’ve been incredibly lucky to survive as long as I did, and I know how much I have to lose. At the same time, staying like this feels unbearable. I’m lonely, unmotivated, and stuck in a cycle: abusing Vyvanse to function, zopiclone to come down, the sober days between I’m in bed, totally depressed watching Netflix trying to escaping the shame of not doing anything with life. Then back to the clinic getting praised for doing well in “recovery.” One time she told me there’s patients like me that reminds me her work is important and changing peoples life for the better. And shes right, just not in the way she thinks! Who can blame someone who hasn’t any experience with addiction for not seeing, or understanding what’s really going on here.\n\nI’m scared to be honest with my nurse. It’s like: What happens next—detox, rehab, post-acute withdrawal, and realizing how much I actually miss Injecting dope and having to care about anything else that hurts in life.\n\nI’m sharing this because I’m completely alone with these thoughts. Loneliness definitely has a lot to do with my state of mind. But I only feel like I can socialize while under influence of my meds. I’m also afraid of geting serious with someone after a really toxic relationship. Took me years to come over her, and I still sometimes finds myself missing what we had. (And let me tell you, that wasn’t not much good…!)\n\nI want a life that feels worth living, not just one where I do fine compared to when I tried to kill myself on a daily basis with no care in the world… Guess I need need find some kind of healthy routine I enjoy and take from there.\n\nI’ve become so fucking lazy since that sentence, it’s crazy.\n\nIf you’re in recovery and have experience with quitting Subutex, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.\n\nAnd dm me of you just want to talk.\n\nDoesn’t have to be about my shity way of wasting my life while complaining about it!\n\nHope you had a good new years, take care of you’re loved ones but most importantly yourself! &lt;3\n\n(And if you made it through!

It was amazing to me and I had immense curiousity about the different drugs and their effects.\n\nThen I eventually realized that I enjoyed being high or intoxicated more than being sober, but I still had responsibilities so I wasn't wasted all the time but it was every chance I got. I stayed in this sort of functional addiction state for quite a few years.\n\nThen life got difficult. I broke up with my long-term girlfriend, had some job insecurity, moved to a new city across the country where I didn't know anyone, and COVID hit at the same time. I'm also bipolar, and while I've had regular episodes since I was 16, my life circumstances made it much more difficult to handle. So my mental health was in the toilet and my brain remembered that drugs and alcohol could change how you feel. I feel like I was primed for addiction and these life circumstances unleashed it full force and I became an outrageous addict.\n\nIt took me about three years to quit for good (well, I'm 16 months sober, so still got a long way to go and I can't get cocky). I did a couple stints in outpatient rehab and had around five relapses in that three year period.\n\nI don't really know what switch flipped in me and sobriety finally stuck.

I've always had very high expectations for myself, and every time I relapsed I felt like I was stabbing my future, ideal self in the back, slowly killing him and destroying my future opportunities.\n\nThe first two months after finally getting sober were fairly difficult as far as cravings go. But coincidentally, I reached a point in my job where I started to feel I was getting the hang of things, so work wasn't so stressful anymore, which made it easier to manage early sobriety. I didn't have withdrawals too bad because I wasn't really physically addicted to anything. I had a couple days of chills due to the nitrous oxide addiction, where I was going through about three boxes of cartridges a day, but nothing compared to opiate or alcohol withdrawal.\n\nMy first full year of sobriety was exclusively dedicated to staying sober. But after a year, I started to introduce new elements in my life that make it more fulfilling.\n\nThe one remaining aspect of my life that hasn't recovered is my social life. I lost some friends while in addiction and it's hard to meet friends and romantic partners when you don't drink. This isn't a huge deal, because I keep myself extremely busy with work, exercise, hobbies, and I'm rigorously studying for an entrance exam for graduate school. So I have very little free time, even on the weekends, and it would be difficult to sustain a relationship. Plus I might move again so I'm reluctant to start anything serious.\n\nI also got really fat in active addiction, which was actually probably caused by some new medication I had to go on, but since getting sober, I've lost 70 lbs. and I feel much more comfortable engaging with people.\n\nPeople relapse all the time after a year and a half, so I still have to be extremely careful. I'm actually going down to Mexico to receive ibogaine therapy in a few months as a further measure to safeguard my sobriety. Relapsing again would be such a major setback at this point that I'm doing everything I possibly can to avoid it.\n\nThat might be more information than you were looking for but you asked a lot of questions.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767417134.0, "id": "nxdywno", "author": "torsojones"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "not a former addict, but one pattern I see come up again and again is that it rarely starts with wanting to self destruct. it usually starts with stress, numbness, or trying to feel normal for a bit, and the hook is how fast the relief shows up. the slide into addiction is often gradual until the person realizes their decisions are being shaped around the substance instead of the other way around. the turning point tends to be less about one dramatic moment and more about exhaustion with the cycle and the consequences stacking up. recovery stories I have heard usually involve replacing the drug with structure, support, and something that gives meaning, even if it feels weak at first. the desire does fade for many people, but it seems to come after a lot of work and not as a sudden switch. i am curious what answers resonate most with you so far.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767418755.0, "id": "nxe2kl7", "author": "trainmindfully"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "I got stuck in a \"bad dream\". Someone whom I loved was involved with cigarrettes so I got attached to the person AND the cigarrette smell AS ONE. The problem was I was too young (a child) to discern one from the other. So they both went into my subconscious psyche as something I longed for, as a pleasurable experience. This I looked for in subsequent relations. Later I realised that that wasnt normal, I was overtly clingy and obssessive. That's when it got bad. I punished myself, hid my obssessions, and addiction, and they became secret. Only many years later did I start to get therapy. But many more years later I started to properly treat the cigarrette problem. How? As incredibly as it sounds, I had to take on cigarrette for myself, no second hand smoker anymore. I had to know for myself what was the poison inside (discernment). Then I started to separate the person and the substances. The body has memory and you can use it if you are kind to it. Give yourself massages in the special places like head, back and forehead, thighs, chest. I started using also CBD cream. Finally, after many months and years struggling with anxiety from no smoke, I took on vaping minimal doses of nicotine (nicotine gum and patches are not for sale in my country). Again this helped me discern what was the toxic in cigarrettes that I was clinging to (mentally and bodily). I consider myself now very much clearer. Still I do attend a NA group. That helped a lot to cause along the way many things were confusing, and I hurt many people and myself too. I am healing still. Everytime I get close to a person that smokes or smells like smoke, it triggers me into a numbed down state, and become like a child again. Also my respiratory system has taken the blow.

Being an awkward kid, I found that drugs loosened my inhibitions. I am extremely self-conscious and drugs made me feel good, funny, and fun to be around. My parents divorced when I was 14 and me and my sister were basically left unsupervised. Next came pot, followed by acid &amp; mushrooms. It went on like that for 10 years and then I was introduced to cocaine and ecstasy and I was done for. My bf was a dealer so it was easily accessible and encouraged. Speed quickly became my drug of choice and I used it daily for 3 years. They were the craziest and most disturbing years of my life up until that point. My bf and I broke up and my supply was caught off so I started drinking heavily. It ended with me drinking a 12 pack alone everyday. I’d isolated myself and through all of it, I made risky decisions jeopardizing my health, my future, and sometimes my life. I was miserable but two important people in my life made me feel loved and cared for. I quit cold turkey by going to meetings and stayed clean for 10 years. Like a lot of other people, when COVID hit, my relationship fell apart and I was devastated and alone. I met a man I was smitten by and ended up relapsing with him.

All of which lower inflammation and keep dopamine levels from food low to avoid energy crashes, both of which inhibit brain function (the dopamine high from “yummy” foods) whenever you taste something you’re like mmmm this is delicious and you smile, your brain is actually a little bit intoxicated. Your brain doesn’t know the difference between food and a drug, it’s all just chemistry. It’s why addiction is such an easy thing to slip into. Your brain can think it’s from food, a necessary source for vitality, and give it the same significance, but usually more intensely as the dopamine in drugs is much higher. I believe this in conjunction with cortisol issues (either physically or secondary to stress) is such a huge driver for the hole this can take us down.\n\nJust in an introspective/analytical state of mind because I really need to quit my vices and I’m finding it so difficult this time around.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "Happy New Year! It's great to hear how you've set yourself the challenge to stop drinking - that is a great one!\n\nI completely understand how overwhelming it is off the bat, especially when your identity has become that partier/drinker, etc. and you have lots of people around you encouraging that decision every day, so a HUGE congratulations on your 2 days of sobriety so far! That is incredible!\n\nTo hopefully make this new years resolution a little bit easier and enjoyable, I would recommend breaking it down.   \n  \nI would firstly, write out a list of everything that triggers this need to go party, a bar, and/or drink in general (this will most likely be certain people you're around, certain places, potentially social media (if so, which ones, certain accounts maybe), certain times of the day/week), from there, I would do my best to distance myself from as much of that as possible.

But when holidays came he relapsed multiple times and im not sure what to do as in terrified he'll slip back into it again.

He has expressed to you that he misses his old life and he’s probably just going to grow resentful of you that he’s not able to use and eventually start using in secret and it will only create more division between you.\n\nIf you do not feel safe in your relationship that is the biggest freaking red flag ever. Out of all of the ways a relationship can make you feel, I believe feeling safe is the most important. How can you build a life with someone and confide in someone who makes you feel unsafe?\n\nYou absolutely cannot control someone’s addiction. No amount of love or support can change someone who is not ready to stop. He is telling you what you want to hear but with his patterns it’s obvious he’s not ready. And you do NOT need to sacrifice yourself for him by staying and waiting for him to get better. If he’s been using meth for 10 years, this is not going to be an easy ride for sobriety and will likely take him a long time. And that’s if he even really does want to stop, which it kinda sounds like he’s just trying to do what he can to keep you around and isn’t intrinsically motivated.\n\nYou are not a bad person for leaving him and you are not the one who makes the choice for him if he decides to use or not. If he starts using again bc you leave, that is entirely his decision and says nothing about you or the way you cared for him. Please stop setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Don’t waste your time in a relationship like this when you could be growing on your own or meeting someone who is going to be able to be there for you the way you are for them. Im saying this as an ex addict btw, and I’m telling you straight up that you would be doing a very very healthy thing by cutting ties and moving on as hard as it may be. \n\nYou genuinely cannot control his choices or change him or love him into wanting to change. This is a losing battle and he needs to figure his shit out on his own instead of dragging you into his mess and keeping you stringed along with false promises while also hinting he’s not really done using. \n\nHe needs a higher level of care than you could ever give him. You are not cruel if you leave him, you would be doing the most compassionate thing you can do both for yourself and for him by refusing to be part of his chaos. It takes years of sobriety to fully transition into living a normal life and being connected to yourself before the drugs again. It takes a ton of work and it’s not easy and if he’s expressing he misses using he’s not ready.\n\nEdit: I just want to say I’m sorry if this is hard to hear, I don’t want you to be in an unsafe situation or feel guilt that is not yours to feel", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767378590.0, "id": "nxaoip1", "author": "cloudsasw1tnesses"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "To really win against addiction, you first need to understand how drug cues and reward learning actually work. In addiction, the brain becomes extremely good at learning patterns. It recognizes environments, emotions, routines, and subtle associations long before you consciously think about using. By the time it feels like a choice, a whole cascade of events is already underway.\n\nAddiction grows stronger over time because the brain keeps refining these patterns. It notices exactly when you’re tired, stressed, bored, or emotionally depleted. You also get exhausted from constantly saying no. Addiction doesn’t fight you directly - it just waits. When your resistance is low, it moves in quietly, almost like it’s outsmarting your conscious mind.\n\nEarly drug use is voluntary and controlled by higher cognitive circuits. These circuits are intelligent but slow. With repetition, control shifts to faster, instinctive habit circuits that bypass conscious thought and willpower. That’s why urges can appear before you even realize them.\n\nRelapse isn’t one decision; it’s a predictable sequence of events. Once the cascade begins, stopping it becomes very difficult. The brain subtly biases thoughts, memories, and emotions toward using, because it has learned that drugs are “important for survival.” From your perspective it feels like you’re choosing, but the brain has already tilted the field.\n\nBecause of this, fighting cravings mid-cascade rarely works. The real control point is preventing the cascade from starting at all. Learn your triggers and avoid the first step. If that first neuron never fires, the whole chain never starts, and your impulse control stays intact.\n\nEvery day you avoid relapse weakens those addiction circuits. Neurons that aren’t used lose strength, while neurons that fire repeatedly get stronger. That’s why changing your environment, routines, and sometimes your social circles is so important early on. It’s not about being “strong,” it’s about avoiding the first activation. If you keep doing all the same routine you did when using, just without drugs now - of course that triggers all the cues and cascade repeatedly. Thats why its hard to just bite your knuckles and push through, like butting your head against a wall repeatedly. \n\nYou don’t need to fix your whole life at once. Just keep delaying relapse. Postpone it today, then again tomorrow. Over time, the learned cues lose their emotional pull, and your conscious control regains power.\n\nUnderstanding this also makes it easier to forgive yourself. Once the cascade is active, you don’t have full control. Less shame, more strategy. Blame yourself only for triggering the cascade, because that part is avoidable. What happens afterward isn’t entirely under conscious control. This is how recovery works, slowly, deliberately, and strategically. Outwait it and outsmart it around it like it tried to outwait and outsmart you.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1767354972.0, "id": "nx8nqbm", "author": "Rude_Lengthiness_101"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "First, nothing you wrote makes you stupid, weak, or broken. What you’re describing is actually very consistent with how the reward system behaves after exposure, especially in people who grew up around addiction.\n\nWhen you tried it and felt calmer, clearer, more verbal, more motivated, that wasn’t some hidden “true you” being revealed. That was a temporary dopamine and norepinephrine surge doing exactly what those circuits are designed to do: reduce anxiety, sharpen focus, and create a strong learning signal that says “this helped, remember this.” The brain doesn’t care about context, morality, or long‑term consequences. It only cares about state change and survival. If something rapidly removes distress, it gets tagged as important.\n\nShame makes this harder, not easier. Shame activates stress circuits, raises cortisol, and actually suppresses baseline dopamine. That creates a low‑reward, high‑threat internal state. From there, the brain becomes even more sensitive to memories of anything that once provided relief. So the desire itself isn’t proof that you want to ruin your life. It’s a nervous system looking for escape from pressure.\n\nGrowing up with addiction around you matters too. Even if you were warned about it, your brain learned early that substances were a way adults regulated pain. That doesn’t mean you’re doomed to repeat it. It just means those associations were laid down earlier and more strongly, so they can light up faster under stress or depression.\n\nThe part of you that wants to “disappear” isn’t actually craving the drug. It’s craving relief from constant self‑monitoring, responsibility, and emotional load. Drugs just happen to be the most efficient shortcut your brain knows for that feeling. That urge tends to show up more when depression lingers quietly in the background, exactly like you described.\n\nWhat matters most is what you’re already doing: you cut contact with the trigger, you’re aware of the risk, you’re scared because you don’t want to blow up your life, and you’re planning therapy. That’s your prefrontal cortex still very much online. Addiction doesn’t start with desire. It starts when desire plus access plus isolation line up. You’ve already interrupted two of those.\n\n**If you need to vent** or talk this through privately with someone who won’t judge or minimize it, I’m open.

He is an addict who wants support to continue using, hence looking for people who would find those his hilarious stories. \n\nHe is resisting because looking at himself and his mistakes, looking at a situation he shouldn't be in, is scary and is pushing him to a change. That changing meaning quitting drugs, means working on sobriety.\n\nWhat scares him is the fear of hearing himself talking and thinking and confessing to things that aren't funny, recounting the reality of drug use and abuse. \nThe problem is, if he doesn't give one step into face that, if doesn't give himself a chance to start, he will be keeping himself in the bed of lies, and one days, that bed crashes. No one around believe in his lies anymore. Actually, it may be no one around him. \n\nWhat he is doing, thinking in leaving his job to keep using, is typical of a person at an advanced level of addiction. I think it's clear to you that, right?! Another thing you bring is him threatening to leave you, in case you don't support what he wants you to support (or keep supporting): his drug abuse. This is an attempt at emotional manipulation, and that means being in an abusive relationship with him. \n\nYou should ask yourself if you are ok with his drug abuse, with his drinking, with his threats, with him only (apparently) living his life persuing his drugs, crashing his career and relationships. Ask yourself if it's ok to you to see him going more and more down and, if you try to talk or bring treatment and therapy, you are faced with accusations of not being a good partner. \nIf you are ok with all of this, and wants to support his drug abuse and keep yourself in a relationship with him and all...

He is just surviving meaning doing the bare minimum to keep his place and his parents money. It’s important for such people to create an external motivation and then hope it becomes an internal one at sometime. \nI would confront him with reality like we both know you don’t want to get clean but you need the job (you always liked to do XYZ). Also who is financing is if you loose the job so I can understand your anger but life usually deals shitty cards to let face them and have a nice dinner after the session or do something he likes. Give him something he can look forward to and then be able to just sit through the sessions. For the sessions itself you could provide topics to talk about but that’s really depended on how much he tells you about them and what’s the final goal abstinence or controlled consumption out of the work place. Also it should be considered what drugs he is currently using maybe medical support could be helpful to archive a clean test and than being able to keep his job.

At all.  Love is understanding, it's kind, it's compassion and it's a beautiful thing!!  If you find someone and they choose to not commit because of someone's past, I would argue they don't actually love that person.   I was engaged for 4 years, to someone I absolutely adored and loved with my whole heart, after 2 years, she confessed to me her past, her shame from that was a heavy weight and she carried it for so long and then she told me, and she was terrified I would leave, but I gave zero fucks because I loved the women I knew then, not some idea of who she was.  It ended due to severe mental health issues and the fact I have a son who was hurt by those, but I still love that person and hope they find someone who loves them and can handle the weight of extreme BPD.  I just tell that because whatever happened before me DID NOT matter.  She had literally fucked over 200 people lol, and it did not matter, at all, because that was not the person I fell in love with.  I hope you can get some help, maybe look into therapy, but also learn to love yourself.  The good and the bad.  The shame is natural but with time maybe you will see that YOU are far more than your sexual history or sexual components.  Your heart is what someone should marry, and sexual history should have no sway in that area imo.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "addiction", "title": "I need help", "text": "I never thought I’d be posting my whole life story on Reddit, but I’m at a point where I just want to be okay. I deal with suicidal thoughts every day — I don’t want to die and I don’t plan to hurt myself, but the pain is constant and I feel like I’m barely hanging on.\n\nGrowing up I had a lot of abandonment and attachment issues. Even as a kid, whenever people left, I’d feel this deep panic and loneliness that never really went away. I was bullied a lot too. I didn’t take care of myself, had terrible hygiene, and acted like an annoying jerk because I didn’t know how else to be.\n\nEventually I started going to the gym, lost weight, skated, and tried to reinvent myself — but instead of becoming confident, I just hid behind this “mysterious tough guy” act while still letting people disrespect me. I’d laugh things off, let people push me around, and pretended it didn’t bother me.\n\nI ended up in a bad relationship — she was manipulative and unfaithful, and I was insecure and weird and kept taking her back. I stopped going to the gym, stopped doing school, and eventually dropped out. One of my biggest regrets isn’t even the education — it’s missing the chance to grow, meet people, and be myself. I hurt my mom during that time too. She didn’t deserve the way I treated her, and I still carry a lot of guilt about it.\n\nThen came weed and nicotine. At first it was just with friends, but over time I became a heavy daily user. I isolated more and more. The brain fog and derealization took over. Weed stopped being fun — it made me anxious, antisocial, and trapped in my own head while everyone else kept living their lives. I envied people who still had connection and family around them.\n\nI got into more unhealthy relationships, made selfish choices, and hurt someone who didn’t deserve it. I still feel ashamed of that. I see parts of myself I hate and I struggle to forgive who I was.\n\nEventually I got a job working alone in a bottle room. It was a long, windowless hallway — and I spent entire shifts ripping carts. Blinkers back to back. I was going through a gram cart a day for years, plus constant vaping nicotine. I greened out at work more times than I can count. I pushed everyone away. My friends stopped inviting me out because I always said no, and honestly, I can’t blame them.\n\nI tried quitting. The first days were okay — then the depression hit like nothing I’ve ever felt before. Terrifying, empty, unreal. I panicked and relapsed because I didn’t know how to survive that feeling. I still regret that. I eventually made it around 60 days sober, and the withdrawal depression finally eased — but I slipped back into “moderation,” which turned into smoking multiple times a day again. Now I feel stuck in the worst middle ground: using enough to stay foggy and numb, but terrified of quitting because I remember how dark withdrawal got.\n\nRight now I have constant dp/dr, brain fog, guilt, shame, isolation, and regret. I’m out of work. Most days I don’t leave my room except on weekends — and even then I’m the quiet, awkward one standing off to the side. I want to fix my hygiene, get healthy again, quit weed and nicotine, clear my head, and actually feel alive — but I feel so weighed down that even getting out of bed is a battle\n\nI wanna be better, I want to fix my hygiene I wasn’t to lose weight I want to be better to others, I wanna know how to love cause somewhere down the line I’ve lost that..\n\nI don’t wanna hate myself anymore and as a man I’m so ashamed to say this but I’m scared..

You can count whatever you want, anyone or thing that says otherwise can fuck off. You are a human being and what matters to you and the people in your life is what *you* say about yourself - because it’s you who have to make these choices and live this life and its consequences. \n\nThat 12 step program does not define you. Plenty of addicts (including myself) use cannabis in some form. The CBD/non-psychoactive stuff is even helpful. But I don’t see my cannabis usage as affecting my sobriety at all. It’s been over seven years now and I’ve never even wanted to drink. If some 12 step program tells you using cannabis means you’re back to square one with your addiction, it is bullshit. \n\nI am assuming the program doesn’t tell you that everyone has relapses, and there is no shame when it happens, it doesn’t ruin some magical number of sobriety, you aren’t “set back” or whatever someone may tell you.\n\n\nNow below is a wall of text about my experiences with SMART Recovery, feel free to ignore.\n\n\nThis program doesn’t sound healthy for you. What helped me through the time after I stopped drinking was a program called SMART Recovery. It guides you in identifying your triggers, understanding why you are having these feelings, and most importantly it helped me remain calm (or as calm as could be in my situation.) when I feel I cannot handle the emotional pain.\n\nBut it’s not magic. You go to a group (or your home.)You fill out a worksheet  (or just draw &amp; write on a sheet of paper). The questioning forces us to evaluate the belief outside of the context of the pain and fear going through our bodies. For example, it helped me understand that my anxiety issues are mostly self-inflicted, and it helps dig in on the “why do I feel this way?” When you understand it, you don’t fear it (or rather you can control the fear when it strikes you).\n\nI found a sense of shared purpose in the meetings - we are all addicted to different things, but we are all addicts - and that is a shared experience no one else has.

I’ve been off subs for years now. I’ve never relapsed aside from shortly after I first started on Suboxone and it was a very short-lived relapse. I have 10 years, almost 11 years clean now.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "For short, acute withdrawals like 7-OH, fentanyl, or tianeptine, the suffering is intense but time limited. The same intensity that makes the first days brutal also forces the brain to activate its recovery systems earlier. Once the drug is gone, the nervous system does not just sit there helplessly. It immediately starts pushing back.\n\nA real shift often happens around day three or four. That is when the brain’s compensatory mechanisms begin to gain traction. Excessive NMDA glutamate signaling, which drives the stress, threat, pain, and panic states, starts getting clamped down. This is not wishful thinking. It is a biological process that happens once the drug pressure lifts.\n\nBecause you are not coming off a long acting opioid like buprenorphine or methadone, you are not stuck in a drawn out plateau. The first genuine improvement in baseline wellbeing is usually only days away, not weeks. Even before that, relief tends to arrive in waves. It is not a clean upward line. The suffering pauses, even briefly at first, and those pauses slowly become more frequent and longer. That matters. Those breaks are your nervous system proving it still knows how to regulate itself.\n\nThe most important mental support right now is knowing that what you are feeling is not a permanent state and not a sign of damage. It is your brain in emergency mode, temporarily overshooting stress signals because it expects the drug to return. Each hour you do not use teaches the system that it has to force adapt instead.\n\nYou are not committing to forever. You are committing to getting through the next hour, the next night, the next sleep cycle. Progress in acute withdrawal is measured in hours and days, not in motivation or willpower. Ideally, you just keep prolonging a lets say months break, but indefinitely. this way the 'forever no drugs' doesnt feel as daunting. The illusion of the option if need be tricks the addiction pathways to calm down a bit. Although for some people, that only makes it worse, so that depends. some people need radical solutions, they cant even start thinking about using because it starts a cascade of relapse events that always happen in the same sequence\n\nWhen a bad surge hits, it does not mean you are back at the start or doing something wrong. It means another stress loop is burning out. If you treat those spikes as proof of failure, they break you. If you treat them as part of the process, they pass faster. Neurons prefer to work in cycles, their fire a bit, then calm down, then action potential rises - they fire again for a bit, and calm down for a bit. Its not a constant suffering after the first two days.\n\nRight now your job is not to feel good. It is to push through, stay alive, comfortable hydrated, fed enough, and resting/distracting/delaying as much as possible. You also do not have to believe in recovery yet. You only have to give your nervous system time to do what it already knows how to do. Once the peak fades and you feel better, its simply natural you're able to take on more hardship and stress, you can take on more. The illusion this is permanent is last attempts of the reward circuit to draw you back to maybe relapsing quickly for a bit. Its a lie. its supposed to feel scary and daunting to have its effect.\n\nAvoid caffeine 100%, because it only amplifies the rebound NMDA glutamate excess that drives half of the discomfort. Thats why gabapentinoids like lyrica or gabapentin are more effective for opioid withdrawal than kratom or codeine. It clamps on part of the same downwards cascade that overactivates during opioid WD.\n\nMagnesium glycinate/citrate also have NMDA antagonist properties, low dose dxm also relieves that excess NMDA rebound too and helps some mental suffering. During withdrawal it helps more than sober.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1767289673.0, "id": "nx3zqnr", "author": "Rude_Lengthiness_101"}

As someone who's been through it (unfortunately many times but haven't touched heroin or fentanyl in like 5 years now) I can tell you this is by far the closest thing to accurate you will find anywhere.\n\nOther tips: If you can sleep take full advantage. \nFan and change of bedding along with a dry towel to lay on (trust me)\nTons of water and steer clear of heavy foods (good chance it's coming back up keep in mind)\nWhen withdrawal spikes (it comes in waves HEAVY) try to get yourself up and take a super hot shower.

With such short duration, I can see how tolerance could progress quickly.\n\nIts important to hear those stories but i think it can also lead to people thinking, “oh thats not gonna be me, I can control this. Its never going to get that bad.”   It also lead to people not knowing where problems will begin, when do things start getting ugly.  Maybe that answer is right when you start?\n\nHow do you know its getting bad, What is the line? 15mg a day, 3 times a week? \n100mg a week total.  \nTaking a break every other week?\n\nPeople set boundaries for themselves and then inevitably cross them as addiction or recreation or tolerance requires.  Having more info would be helpful because most info is just these heroic doses of people deep into this.\n\nI periodically have pain and that be nice to be able to self manage.  Itd also be nice to just have on hand as needed.  I’ve already moved past that, beyond my original intent and into recreation.\n\nCan people give me some solid metric some point the use of this is becomes real.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "addiction", "title": "Feeling pretty defeated. Some advice would be appreciated.", "text": "I’ve gotten myself into a pretty rough situation and could really use some advice.\n\nFor years I used clonazepam and alprazolam sporadically. It was never consistent enough to require tapering and I always took breaks. Over time, though, my use became more frequent, so about a year ago I decided to taper properly using diazepam that my doctor prescribed. The taper could have been much shorter, but that’s another story. I jumped off at 1.25mg about a month ago and was actually doing fine.\n\nAbout ten days ago, I relapsed on Dexedrine. It’s similar to Adderall, but it’s 100 percent dextroamphetamine. After three days of use with barely any sleep, I felt terrible and took 35mg of diazepam during the comedown. A week passed and aside from some rebound anxiety, I felt okay and knew I didn’t need to reinstate.\n\nThen I messed up again. I used Dexedrine two days in a row and ended up taking 40mg of diazepam about 24 hours ago, followed by another 35mg about 20 minutes ago.\n\nFor context, I get 30 tablets of 5mg diazepam every 15 days. I now have 15 tablets left to last me the next 13 days. I’m trying to figure out whether it makes more sense to just stop now and ride it out, hoping the withdrawal isn’t too bad, or if I should do a very short reinstatement taper. Something like 5mg for a week, then 2.5mg for a week, then 1.25mg for a week before jumping again.\n\nI want to be clear that I don’t abuse benzos on their own. I’ve used them responsibly and as prescribed since I was 16, and I often went months without taking any at all. I’m 31 now. The only times I end up taking higher doses like this are when I slip up with stimulant use and feel like I need something to help me land.\n\nI’m not looking for a lecture about Dexedrine. I know that’s what caused this situation, and I’m already dealing with it through my doctors and trying to find a therapist who’s a good fit. What I’m really hoping for is advice on whether stopping now and pushing through is the better option, or if doing a short taper would be safer. If anyone has experience with this or solid knowledge, I’d really appreciate hearing it.\n\nI’m already beating myself up enough as it is, so empathy would mean a lot.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "addiction", "text": "I asked chatgtp for you. I hope it helps.\n\nI’m going to answer this carefully and pragmatically, because this is one of those moments where how you respond matters more than ideology (“never reinstate” vs “always taper”).\n\nI’m not your doctor, but based on what you’ve described, here’s the clinically grounded way to think about this.\n\nThe core issue (plain truth)\n\nWhat destabilized you was not jumping off at 1.25 mg a month ago.\n\nWhat destabilized you was:\n   •   Two stimulant relapses\n   •   Severe sleep deprivation\n   •   Two very large, acute diazepam rescue doses (≈75 mg total in ~24 hrs)\n\nThat means your GABA system has just been yanked up sharply, not gradually.\n\nSo the real question is not:\n\n“Do I need to taper because I’m dependent again?”\n\nIt’s:\n\n“Do I need a brief, controlled stabilization to avoid rebound and another panic-driven rescue?”\n\nOption A: Stop now (“ride it out”)\n\nPros\n   •   Avoids extending benzo exposure\n   •   No new taper commitment\n\nCons (important)\n   •   After large acute doses, stopping abruptly can cause:\n      •   Rebound anxiety\n      •   Insomnia\n      •   Autonomic symptoms\n   •   Those symptoms increase the risk of:\n      •   Another stimulant relapse\n      •   Another panic-driven benzo binge\n(this is the real danger loop)\n\nThis option only works if:\n   •   You can tolerate discomfort\n   •   You are confident you won’t self-medicate again\n   •   You have good external support\n\nGiven what just happened, this is higher risk.\n\n\nOption B: Short, controlled reinstatement taper (harm-reduction approach)\n\nWhat you proposed:\n\n5 mg for a week → 2.5 mg for a week → 1.25 mg for a week → stop\n\nWhy this makes sense in your situation\n   •   It’s time-limited\n   •   Doses are low\n   •   It converts chaotic rescue dosing into predictable exposure\n   •   It reduces rebound severity and lowers relapse risk\n   •   It does not undo your original taper\n\nThis is not “starting over” — it’s damage control.\n\n\nPill math (important reality check)\n\nYou have:\n   •   15 × 5 mg = 75 mg total\n   •   13 days until refill\n\nYour proposed 3-week taper won’t fit your supply.\n\nSo if you do this, it must be shorter.\n\nA supply-realistic version (example, not a prescription):\n   •   5 mg daily for 5–6 days\n   •   Then 2.5 mg daily for the remaining days\n   •   Then stop\n\nThat uses your tablets without forcing a cliff drop.\n\n⚠️ The exact plan should ideally be confirmed with your prescriber.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767202532.0, "id": "nwy3f8r", "author": "tabbycat1991"}
