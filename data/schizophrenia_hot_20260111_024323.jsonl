{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "# What is Schizophrenia?\n\nSchizophrenia is a serious disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and acts. Someone with schizophrenia may have difficulty distinguishing between what is real and what is imaginary; may be unresponsive or withdrawn; and may have difficulty expressing normal emotions in social situations.\n\nSchizophrenia belongs to a larger class of neuro-psych disorders called the \"Psychotic disorders.\" The primary feature of these disorders is a symptom known as psychosis- an altered state of perceiving reality that has proven to be detrimental to the sufferer. The psychotic disorders are distinct from the bulk of other mental illnesses due to their clear neurological underpinning; schizophrenia is closer to autism or ADHD than your garden-variety anxiety and depression, for example.\n\nContrary to public perception, schizophrenia is **not** split personality or multiple personality. The vast majority of people with schizophrenia are **not** violent and do not pose a danger to others. Schizophrenia is **not** caused by childhood experiences, poor parenting, or lack of willpower, nor are the symptoms identical for each person. The risk factors that contribute to each person's schizophrenia is as unique as how their symptoms may be expressed.\n\nSymptoms of schizophrenia are often categorized into three areas:\n\n**Positive symptoms** are disturbances that are \"added\" to the person's personality.\n\n* *Delusions*: false ideas- individuals may believe that someone is spying on him or her, or that they are someone famous.\n* *Hallucinations:* seeing, feeling, tasting, hearing or smelling something that doesn’t exist to those around the individual. The most common experience is hearing voices that give commands or comments to the individual.\n* *Disordered thinking and speech:* moving from one topic to another, in a nonsensical fashion. Individuals may make up their own words or sounds.\n\n**Negative symptoms** are capabilities that are “lost” from the person’s personality.\n\n* Social withdrawal\n* Extreme apathy\n* Lack of drive or initiative\n* Emotional unresponsiveness\n\n**Cognitive impairments** often are independent of psychotic symptoms but can greatly impact the individual's ability to function in society (ex. hold a job).\n\n* Poor executive functioning (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions)\n* Trouble focusing or paying attention.\n* Problems with working memory (the ability to use information immediately after learning it)", "score": 17, "created_utc": 1731390692.0, "id": "lwpizki", "author": "Empty_Insight"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "# Do you think you may be developing Schizophrenia?\n\nMany people come here concerned they may have or may be developing schizophrenia. The answer to this is twofold:\n\n* **We cannot answer that,** although we can discuss individual symptoms.\n* **See a doctor** or mental health professional.\n\nThere are many recurring topics involved, so please read this and see whether it contains the answer to your question:\n\n# Around the Time of Sleep\n\nIf you hear voices, see things, or think weird things when you are trying to sleep, this state is called *hypnagogia*, the symptoms of which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnagogia#Symptoms). This can also occur shortly after waking, known as *hypnopompic hallucinations.* These types of hallucinations are 'normal' and not *necessarily* a cause for concern.\n\n# Staring or Daydreaming\n\nIf you \"see\" things when you stare at the sky, the wall, or anything, this is normal.\n\nIf you think you see things or get weird sensations when you \"zone out\" or lose focus, that is normal.\n\n# Drug Use\n\nIf you use mind-altering substances, they will alter the mind. *They do not cause schizophrenia.*\n\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist about their drug advice. If it is illegal drugs, stop it and talk to a doctor. If you refuse to follow doctors' advice, then accept responsibility for your own actions. Posts describing experiences while on mind-altering drugs but not experienced sober may be removed.\n\nIf you begin to have symptoms of drug-induced psychosis while *not* under the influence of drugs, we would strongly suggest you (a) seek professional treatment as soon as possible and (b) cease the use of any substances that may be exacerbating your condition *if it is safe to do so.* (Special exception for alcohol and/or benzodiazepine use- ***do not*** ***stop using these cold-turkey***, and seek professional guidance on how to quit)\n\n# Relatives\n\nIf you have relatives with schizophrenia or similar conditions, it does raise the chances that you will develop it also. However, everybody has a statistical risk.\n\nThe heritability of neuropsych disorders is complicated. Several studies have put the general ballpark at 80% heritability, but it is important to note that heritability does not provide *certainty,* all it can tell you is the general risk you have of *potentially* developing schizophrenia. The more first-degree relatives (immediate family) you have with schizophrenia, the higher your risk is as well. However, knowing the risk ahead of time can allow someone to make a solid plan and try to minimize preventable risk factors in the environment.\n\nEverybody should, if they can, develop a plan for future medical problems, whether it be mental illness, a coma, or severe illness. Let your wishes be known now so others can implement them should the worst happen.\n\n# Depression and Anxiety\n\nIf you have depression, depression can cause psychotic symptoms (Major Depression with Psychotic Features). Many people with anxiety mistake symptoms of anxiety for \"going crazy\" or specific psychotic symptoms.\n\n# Actual Psychosis\n\nYou may actually have psychotic symptoms and if you describe them, we can often recognize them either because of familiarity due to personal experience or study.\n\nYou are not alone. However, we cannot say what the diagnosis would be. Schizophrenia and other mental disorders are somewhat arbitrarily defined and there can be many causes of the symptoms. So please, **see a doctor or mental health professional as soon as you can.**\n\nIf you would like a community more specifically tailored to generalized questions/discussion over psychosis, we may direct you to r/Psychosis.\n\n# Self-Diagnosis\n\nAs mentioned above, schizophrenia belongs to a larger class of neuro-psych disorders called the psychotic disorders. There is a significant amount of overlap between the different psychotic disorders, and that any non-clinician would be able to determine the correct diagnosis while considering *all* pertinent information- including ruling out all *other* possibilities- is not feasible. Furthermore, there is nothing of any meaning or substance to be done to help the symptoms of schizophrenia aside from mundane wellness tips (sleep hygiene, physical activity, social engagement, etc.) so we do not consider self-diagnosis valid here as it is not productive in any way.\n\nAll types are welcome here- neurotypical, neurodivergent, those with diagnosed psychotic disorders- but there *is* a caveat, and that is that we request people be *genuine* here. Don't try to frame yourself as \"one of us\" if you haven't been formally diagnosed, because schizophrenia is ultimately a diagnosis, a tool to help guide treatment- and you either have that diagnosis or you don't. That's a yes/no question, there are two possible answers. If the answer is no... then don't act like it's actually \"yes.\"", "score": 14, "created_utc": 1731391235.0, "id": "lwpjyqu", "author": "Empty_Insight"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "# Worried you may be \"going crazy?\"\n\nSchizophrenia is a rare condition affecting approximately 1% of the population. Many (but not all) people with the illness do not realize that they are becoming sick until they end up in the hospital. Some people develop a *strong obsessional fear* however that they are indeed developing schizophrenia. A medically trained professional will be able to help you discern between the onset of schizophrenia and strong fears associated with anxiety. These types of fear can lead some to interpret the world around them as possible symptoms of schizophrenia, which can lead to circle-type thought processes that torment the sufferer.\n\nA key symptom of anxiety-based fears for developing schizophrenia is the *fear that you are “going crazy” or “losing your mind.”* If you find you have these fears, please seek professional help. Here at this subreddit **we cannot diagnose you either way, but a professional can.** If you receive word that you are *not* developing schizophrenia from your doctor, try your best to accept that, and if you feel you still would like advice from Reddit users, please go to r/Anxiety.\n\nThere is known to be a particularly strong fear in some individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder who are obsessed with a fear of \"going crazy\" and developing schizophrenia. It is so common that there is, in fact, an entire subreddit for it; we may recommend any with OCD who are afraid of developing schizophrenia to visit r/SchizOCD.\n\nAs said in the body of the post, there is no unique symptoms one can use to determine whether or not a person's psychosis is or is not schizophrenia.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "# Diagnosis of Schizophrenia\n\nThere can be *many* causes for one's symptoms- as referenced below. Best practices in psychiatry dictate that schizophrenia is regarded as a diagnosis of exclusion, to be used if every other reasonable alternative has been excluded, and differential diagnosis is to be employed. We do not believe that the average person has sufficient knowledge of *all* psychotic disorders in order to rule out every other possibility and accurately self-diagnose schizophrenia; as such, we do not consider self-diagnosis valid here.\n\nSometimes the root cause for psychosis can be a somatic issue (electrolyte imbalances, metabolic issues, anemias of a number of varieties, heavy metal toxicity, Temporal Lobe Epilepsy, etc.) and if you feel as though your concerns have not been adequately addressed, we would encourage seeking a second opinion with a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to rule out mundane causes for these issues. If one's root cause of psychosis can be corrected *without* the need for neuroleptic medication, we believe that is an ideal to strive for. However, that is not the case in the majority of circumstances, so we ask that people be mindful of the practical realities of this disorder. Wishful thinking does often carry a substantial price with it when it comes to psychotic disorders.\n\nA diagnosis is a tool to guide treatment, and nothing more. To make sure you are getting the right treatment, you need to have the right diagnosis. Given how tricky it can be to differentiate, it is imperative that you seek the care of a trained, licensed professional to ensure you receive the correct diagnosis for your condition(s).\n\n# Schizophrenia in the DSM-5\n\nFrom the current **Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5):**\n\n**Schizophrenia 295.90 (F20.9)**\n\nA. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):\n\n    1. Delusions.\n    \n    2. Hallucinations.\n    \n    3. Disorganized speech (eg, frequent derailment or incoherence)\n    \n    4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior.\n    \n    5. Negative symptoms (ie, diminished emotional expression or avolition).\n\nB. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relationships, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).\n\nC. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less, if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (ie, active phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodomal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbances may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (eg, odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).\n\nD. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.\n\nE. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (eg, a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.\n\nF. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).\n\n\\*If these symptoms match- or are close to matching- something that you are experiencing, we would strongly suggest seeking formal treatment. Even if it is not actually schizophrenia, it is *something* of some serious concern, and that something needs to be addressed ASAP.", "score": 9, "created_utc": 1731391585.0, "id": "lwpkll9", "author": "Empty_Insight"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "# About the Subreddit\n\nr/schizophrenia is (currently) the largest community of any size- both online or offline- for those who suffer from psychotic disorders.\n\nA lot of groups for people with schizophrenia do eventually begin to collapse inwards for one reason or another. There are two main reasons this happens:\n\n1. The groups are run or overseen by neurotypical people who do not have any type of psychotic disorder. They are too restrictive on topics regarding psychosis because they do not have the experience with which to understand them. The lack of nuance in how they perceive things leads to controversial-yet-valid discussions being stamped out.\n   * This is the reason most groups for schizophrenia offline are not that popular. People do generally mistrust those who they do not believe 'get it' to a degree where they feel comfortable participating. Participation is key in success.\n2. On the flipside, groups which are run by people with psychosis can have too lax of content moderation, and the group will devolve into a glorified insane asylum. They may be overrun with spam and shills, or even worse- they turn into something resembling a cult.\n   * It remains an unfortunate reality that many people with schizophrenia are vulnerable to delusions of grandeur, and even imaginary internet power (being a Reddit/Discord mod or Facebook group admin) can go to their heads. They may end up shilling practices that are 'woo' or simply off-putting to those who may not agree (Keto, \"praying the crazy away,\" etc.) and leads to alienation of a significant chunk of the userbase. Groups like this are a dime-a-dozen on Facebook.\n\nWhat it inevitably comes down to for why communities fail, it is poor content moderation practices. It's either being too strict and driving people away, or too lax and allowing the community to become infested with people/bots who are dedicated to taking advantage of the mentally ill.\n\nWe operate here with that clarity of understanding in mind for how we approach content moderation. We strive to keep a good balance here; we remain on-topic and we are transparent about our rules and their interpretation, but *we do enforce them strictly.* If you see something on the subreddit which you believe violates our rules but it is still up, the most likely explanation is that we have not seen it yet- since we are not wizards, omniscient, or online 24/7. In that case, we ask that you 'hit that mf report button' as the kids say, draw our attention to it so that we can take a look. If we find that it violates our rules, we will remove it.\n\n# About the Mods\n\nAll of the mods here- past and present- have a verified, diagnosed psychotic disorder. Our team comes from a variety of backgrounds and in a number of different countries, and our experience with psychosis summed up totals more than a century.\n\nIn short: This is not amateur hour. This is a community *for* people with schizophrenia *by* people with schizophrenia, ~~calloused~~ seasoned by many years of lived experience.\n\nUnlike many Reddit mods you may run across, we're quite aware that we are volunteer internet janitors- not clout-chasing, power-hungry turbo-jannies. There is no glory in this job, we're just sweeping up trash when we see it... and occasionally writing posts. Still, seeing the community grow and thrive is kind of its own reward, as hokey as that may sound.\n\nIf you want to learn more about us... hang out, say hi. Pull up a chair. We don't bite.\n\n# About the Community\n\nWe've had a fair amount of wackiness here ourselves, but r/schizophrenia has survived for 15 years now; we've had cultists (including a former mod turning the old Discord into a theocracy, and [these lovely folks](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/notices/problemgroups/#wiki_crazy_nice_people_.28discord.29) who were so toxic we don't even allow their name here), 4chan brigades, and enough absurd nonsense to fill an entire book. We've been around, we've seen a thing or two. Oddly enough, people tend to stick with us even when the spicy stuff hits, so that leads to believe that we're at least doing *something* right.\n\nThe subreddit itself primarily serves the function of a library. Obviously, as this post can attest to, we have a number of resources available that we may direct people to for whatever specific needs you may have- this is a landing site to help those in need of guidance find where they need to go and what they need to know. If you are diagnosed and looking for a community that is more active in direct interaction, we have our [official Discord](https://discord.gg/pkn5n5CBPa) and also post monthly Megathreads for people to advertise their own Discords- which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/search/?q=Discord+Megathread). While the subreddit may be a library, it is nonetheless perfectly usable as a community and virtual hangout space- much as an actual library is.\n\nIdeally, people will eventually no longer need the schizophrenia subreddit and eventually unsubscribe when they no longer feel their presence here beneficial to their mental health. Oftentimes, people are reminded shortly thereafter that schizophrenia is lifelong and it is not so easy to leave it in the past- and come back. As a natural consequence of that ideal, we're not too focused on \"growth\" or gimmicks here. We try to keep things fairly laid back around here.\n\n*All* communities we are even loosely affiliated with are listed in the sidebar on desktop, or under \"About\" on mobile. There is occasionally the interesting occurrence that someone who is *not* affiliated with us will claim that they are, but if the community isn't in the sidebar- that's a no-go.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "# Disclaimer\n\nr/schizophrenia is a place for *casual* discussion of schizophrenia- not professional. We ask that you take any advice you receive here with a grain of salt. While we aspire to keep the subreddit a valuable tool for those wanting to learn more and helping them best advocate for themselves, the subreddit *is not a substitute for formal treatment*. No matter how stellar the advice you may get from here is, I may remind everyone that psychosis is a neurological condition. One can no more be talked out of psychosis than they can seizures; there is no substitute for antipsychotic medication in treating psychosis, and no meaningful alternative that even comes close.\n\n# Substance Use\n\nDiscussion of illicit substances and how they may affect one's symptoms is relatively frequent here, but we ask everyone to be mindful of the ramifications of such decisions. Please discuss any use of illicit substances with your treatment team, as well as the pharmacist where you fill your prescriptions so they can be made aware and monitor for drug interactions with anything you may take. Patient privacy and confidentiality protects you from having this information used against you, as it does not create an imminent danger to yourself or others.\n\n# Unsourced Information / Dubious Credibility\n\nIf you receive advice pertaining to medications and/or supplements made without evidence, or the evidence is of low quality (not peer reviewed, LLM generated, etc.) we ask that you maintain a healthy skepticism. If your treatment team states one thing but someone says otherwise here, we strongly suggest you follow the guidance of your treatment team.\n\nIt is worth noting that misinformation is *rampant* in mental health spaces, and has been for decades. There are many reasons for this, and unfortunately, some of them are not innocent. We go into that in a little more detail on our subreddit Wiki entry over [Medical Misinformation](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/rules/medical_advice/).\n\n**There is no cure for schizophrenia.** There is nothing that can render it permanently past-tense. It is a chronic disease, lifelong, and can *at best* be described as being in remission. This is a foundational truth of understanding schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. This is a common delusion- so much so that we have a designated [\"Cure Log\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/wiki/rules/delusions/#wiki_a_cure_for_schizophrenia) on our Delusions Wiki from things we have actually seen here. It is unfortunate that sometimes attempting to publicize a cure for schizophrenia is not an 'honest mistake' or due to someone having their mind clouded by delusions, and are instead advanced with considerably less noble intent... namely, snake oil salesmen.\n\nNo competent, sane, and/or moral person with schizophrenia will ever be advertising a cure or anything of the sort without a Nobel Prize in hand. Which one of those applies (or what combination) depends upon the person and their motives. As our \"Cure Log\" shows, this is something to be taken with zero seriousness if you come across it here or elsewhere.\n\n# Large Language Models (LLMs)/Other AI\n\nIt seems many LLMs (Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude) have been trained on information that is not correct, and we regurgitate it in a manner that seems 'close enough' if you don't know to look any further. There is next to no transparency on what data is used to train these LLMs, and unfortunately it does not seem as though their training imparts any specific preference to credentials or proof that someone knows the matter at hand they are discussing and not merely \"confidently incorrect.\" Errors noticed in outputs from LLMs suggest that they were trained- at least in part- on misinformation.\n\nAnything gleaned from an LLM regarding schizophrenia or mental health should be treated with *great* skepticism, and presumed to be incorrect on anything much deeper than surface-level examination.\n\n# Subreddit Culture and Norms\n\nWe have a number of norms here which do not necessarily reflect the clinically accurate perception of schizophrenia, such as perceiving schizoaffective disorder to be a subtype of schizophrenia, or 'slang' such as \"rebound psychosis\" upon ceasing antipsychotic medication. You may notice user flairs which still use antiquated terminology, such as subtypes of schizophrenia which no longer exist in the DSM 5 (*but* are still in ICD codes).\n\nThese terms also vary substantially by country, and this subreddit is a global community.

Living in a small town, he was conditioned in a difficult environment.\n\nHis mother (figuratively speaking), took my aunt and left my father with my grandfather (a man who was going to kick him out of the house).\nMy father had to live in the houses of other people, acquaintances, living off favors.\nHe sold popsicles on the street.\n\nMy mother lived in an even worse rural area, practically living off subsistence and bartering. She didn't have anything processed, it was difficult, she didn't have toys or anything like that. From a young age, she worked on my grandfather's land.\nMy mother suffered bullying at school for not having bras or new shoes.\n\nYes, that's in the past. They met, went to a big city, and tried to make a life for themselves there... And they succeeded.\nNothing absurd, but something stable.\nThey had their first child.\n\nHow to say it? My older brother, he's incredible, what he's lived through, in the outskirts of the city. A reflection of peripheral youth.\n50 Cent, Tupac, Big, Racionais, Facção Central, a286, Sabotagem.\nBesides classic reggae, because, well, my brother likes that plant.\nThat was incredible, that energy, parties, hanging out in the streets.\nHe's what we call a street kid.\n\n\nMy other brother, how can I describe this guy?\nI was going to describe him, but I'll avoid it, after all it's too intimate, and I dislike dealing with other people's sensitivities.\nBut anyway, my brother, a young man who lived through the same things as my other brother. And decided to be a rapper, yes, he sang in some amateur shows in the neighborhood.\nIt was cool, I went to some, he was a duo, him and my cousin.\n\nHe truly lived, friends.\n\nMy sister, she's cool, she lived through that Facebook era, the peak.\n\nIt was cool, she had lots of friends, and she was always at the mall.\n\n\nThis description only serves to confirm a fact I've been observing.\n\nI didn't live through it.\n\n\nShitty childhood.\n\nAnd now, in this damn adolescence (yes, I'm just a fucking teenager), but I feel like a failure (I know I'm just starting my life).\nBut how can I say it? I'm just a blank slate.\n\n\nI'm not a radicalized guy, I dislike that, it wasn't anyone's fault.\n\nBut damn it, I have to put on my humiliation show.\n\n\nI remember all the times I was there, walking in a group, with people who didn't care about me. I was always left behind, it was like the universe was pushing me.\n\n\"Look, you have to stay behind. Useless.\"\n\nThe bullying wasn't very nice. But I encouraged it.\n\nI had a shitty perception of things, maybe because I never received attention.\nI thought I had to humiliate myself, so I did it, I liked the look of laughter on people's faces.\nSo I spent a good amount of time humiliating myself, I had become a court jester.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nI've never kissed, never dated, and obviously never had sex.\nThat doesn't bother me, I even think I'm asexual.\n\nBut the fact is that I never lived.\n\nI never had a real friend, everything was a shitty relationship. I humiliated myself for attention, they laughed, and that was it.\n\nI was like a dog, they would look at me and laugh, and that was it, no conversations, no hanging out, nothing.\n\nBut that's not the main point, I don't hate my appearance (even though it's a bit worn out), but it's so bland.\n\nI have no style.\nI have nothing remarkable.\nI'm not good at art.\nThere's nothing interesting about me, absolutely nothing.\n\n\nI'm a blank sheet of paper.\nIn truth, I think the only part would be me being a fucking lunatic.\nThere were so many diagnoses after my shitty breakdown. So many medications, so many trips to the doctor.\nI don't feel human, I'm empty, and that's not cool.\nDamn, I don't want to be like this, I just want to be in a park, with friends, laughing, drinking, doing something stupid.\n\nI don't want to be locked in a shitty room.\n\n\nThis is a new year, a new school, I hope for a new chance.\n\n\nI just want to live, just like my family lived.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768031762.0, "id": "1q8ycev", "author": "Ok_Second1283", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1q8ycev/i_guess_im_just_too_young/"}

Probably you can try some mental treatment to handle/alleviate the symptoms, like those known as CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy).

E.g. small silly funny dance, thumbing up or giving high five to \"my best friend in the mirror\", giving words of encouragement to cheer up \"him\". Kinda disrupting the bad feelings with bright feelings.. sometimes it feels like \"my deepest part of my heart, my true self speaks through my mouth\"\nAnother thing I do is just to speak to my colleagues, so I project my \"mental channel\" to real world, ignoring the \"false/fake\" insignificant things, deem them insignificant.\nMy recent experience is that I feel some voices were creeping up, but then I tried to talk to myself about my plans, things I need to do that day, switching the focus. Then I realized, the voices \"have faded away\"!\n\nAnd basically, just be a friend to ourselves.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "I believe the real essence of God is love and unity. In Christianity, Jesus prayed that the disciples become one, as Father and Him as one. So as one returns to God, they essentially join the spiritual unity of love. No conflict, no division, no competition.\n\nAnd... my interpretation of the heavenly realm is that, it's far beyond our comprehension. In physics there is concept/theory of higher dimension. The allegory is a creature in 2-dimensional only now direction of flat plane, it won't comprehend vertical aspect of dimension. We can imagine it like an amoeba moving on a flat plane. When a 3-dimensional object \"visits\" the 2-dimensional plane, the \"creatures\" there will get confused. For example if a ball goes through the plane, from the 2-dimensional perspective, it will be seen at first as a dot, then getting larger to circle, then after its circumference, it will decrease into a dot, then vanishes. That's because the vertical dimension is unseen to the creature.\n\nSo my guess is, as one returns to God, one is essentially transcending to a higher dimension! Like an amoeba, or an ant, transforms into a human. The creature will experience a whole different perspective, perception. Everything the creature experienced in the lower dimension is deemed as insignificant, somewhat \"worthless\" compared to the reality of the \"newfound\" higher dimension. So relating to human reality, the lower things like  physical pleasure, lower energy feelings like hate, fear, etc will not be relatable in the higher dimension, with a whole new kind of perception, idea, pleasures in that reality.\n\nIn Christianity, there are some heavenly creatures that are perceived by some prophets (Ezekiel, Daniel, John) as weird looking creatures. I believe, that's because they were seen from a mere 3 dimensional perspective of humans. As one ascends to the heavenly realm, a higher dimension, with heavenly perception, then the creatures will *make sense* to them.\n\nAllow me to quote one passage that may relate here\n\n&gt;*1 Corinthians 2:9* But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\n\nBTW, some spiritualists interpret love as the highest vibrational energy. I think that holds some truth. That beyond our mere realm, there is some metaphysical reality that affects the seen reality where we perceive the real world.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768029848.0, "id": "nyr0c7r", "author": "aseeder"}

Also if you have a mood disorder alongside schizophrenia it would be schizoaffective so they could be ruling that out. Psychotic disorders are chronic and generally need at least 6 months of psychosis or at least 2 weeks outside of mood episodes for psychosis. So they might be trying to monitor your symptoms and responses long term. I’ve had psychosis symptoms for years, but it only really got psychosis instead of “psychosis” the past 4-5 months total. I had a bpd diagnosis for years as young as 13 and I just finished an IOP program and they finally realized it’s either bipolar 1 with psychotic features or schizoaffective bipolar type. They diagnosed with both until I could see my normal psych leaving notes and copies of the interviews and screeners and such. She’s very focused on bpd so I hope she’ll listen to them as both did two hour interviews from scratch and came to the same conclusion instead of glancing at my chart and asking three questions like they normally do. I see her Monday so we’ll see. Anyways if you’re actively in the psych ward sometimes it goes faster but generally these things take time if they’re a good psych because they want to be accurate.

The term began to take on its own meaning as researchers began to discern differences between a subset of children who presented slightly differently and had a different trajectory than other children with Schizophrenia. It wasn’t until the research of Kolvin (1971) that Autism was distinguished from Schizophrenia, and finally, in 1980 Autism was separated from Schizophrenia in the DSM-III.

This increased risk stems from shared genetic factors, overlapping symptoms like social withdrawal, and a complex neurobiological link, making it important to differentiate these conditions despite their commonalities\n\n[https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/schizophrenia-prevalence-may-threefold-higher-people-autism/](https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/schizophrenia-prevalence-may-threefold-higher-people-autism/)\n\nI remember a lady I had a college class with telling me that autism used to be called Childhood Schizophrenia.

My mom and step father both had some bad diseases so they got priority on treatment. Not even when the Girls' Club I attended after school contacted my mom about my weird social behavior.

I hadn't seen her in over 8 years, and I didn't know where she went after the therapy farm closed down. And I started to have visions of her being dead, being mistreated, and other bad things happening to her. So I went looking for her, cause I wanted answers and peace of mind. 2 months later I found her and we were reunited, she was okay, and I was allowed to see her again anytime from then on.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of it. The visions came back after just over a month, and they slowly got worse. Eventually I saw her die 50 times a day. Due to these visions I emotionally overloaded her everytime we were together, and after half a year I had to say goodbye to her since her owner saw it wasn't healthy for the both of us to be together.\n\nWhile this was happening I had built a close friendship with a girl I met in October 2024. And after I said goodbye to that horse the visions started to focus on her. I also developed the delusion that it was my duty to take care of her and protect her. This delusion made it hard for me to give her space, and that started to exhaust her.\n\nAnd because I found it hard to leave her side I accidentally caused her to fall backwards in her wheelchair. After that all hell broke loose in my head. I had failed to protect her, I had failed my duties. In fact, I was the danger, I was a monster. Or so I believed.\n\nAfter the accident she asked for space to process it all. And I tried my best to give her that, but I failed. And in October 2025 she paused our friendship, under the condition that I fix what went wrong in my head.\n\nI had peace for all of 2 weeks. Then the demons in my head started to focus on another friend who was there for me through all this. This time I caught on early and discussed this with her in hopes of not making the same mistakes as the last time. Which helped, we figured out a system to minimize triggers.\n\nThen a month and a half ago I switched medication from Risperidon to Aripiprazol and everything just slowly stopped. No more visions, no more intrusive thoughts, no more delusions of being a protector, no more being terrified my friend is going to die soon.\n\nI don't know yet if it's really over, but now I can see clearly what happened and the damage I caused because of it.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "Hey, that specific fear has always been one of my greatest sources of fear and paranoia. On bad days it can slip into actual delusion or hallucinations, but with a good medication regimen those days are very few and far between now. I used to spend hours prowling my house, turning on lights, checking under beds and in closets, all that good stuff. So I think I can understand where you’re coming from! I’m terribly sorry that this is such a frightening and stressful time for you.\n\nDo you have a therapist you’re working with? Are you taking your meds? Those are great things, but in the meantime what helped me: keeping all the lights on, all the closet doors open, the shower curtain to the side, everything you can think of to illuminate the darker spaces of your home. Keep them on all night if you have to. It may feel ridiculous, but if it helps soothe your anxiety even an iota, it’s a win. Do breathing exercises. They feel stupid at first, but they’re proven to truly help with physiological signs of panic. Craft a mantra for yourself, and repeat it when you get anxious. “I am completely alone. I am safe. I am absolutely safe, and I am alone.” Call a friend to talk it over if you feel like you want to talk about it. You can even install inexpensive cameras in your living space to monitor the situation if that makes you feel more comfortable. Keep your environment quiet, and don’t use headphones for a while until you get used to the specific settling sounds of your space and your neighborhood at different times of the day.\n\nAnd finally, if you feel you can be a good and responsible pet owner at this time, an older rescue cat might be a good idea for company. My girl would most definitely let me know if there was anyone else in here with us, haha, and it’s always nice to have a companion when the night seems long.", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1767939855.0, "id": "nyjvgj7", "author": "thatbroadcast"}

Bring your list with you in case you get nervous, and when they ask, bring it out and show or tell them. It helps to also go in with an idea of what kind of therapy you think will be most beneficial for you. For a lot of us that’s CBT-P (CBT for psychosis). That being said, my own therapist likes to use a mix of CBT, DBT, and regular old talk therapy, and I’ve found it extremely helpful in regards to building routine, confronting symptoms, and hitting milestones for self improvement. \n\nIt helps to go in with an idea of what you think might suit you best, but don’t panic if you don’t know just yet. This is more like a “getting to know you” conversation when it comes down to it, so it’s best to just lay out what you need help with without going deep into your feelings and being incredibly specific about issues right off the bat. You’re laying groundwork, remember, not diving right in.\n\nRemember that you’re interviewing them, too, also! Ask them what modalities of therapy they have been trained in and use, if they have experience working with the schizophrenic population, how they prefer to approach therapy with clients, their usual communication style, anything and everything you want to know. From there you can get a good sense of if this particular person will be a good fit for you.\n\nGood luck! Don’t be nervous, man. They’ve probably heard it all before, remember?

Also if not allowed please delete. \n\nSo I am taking to this guy (M21 if that matters) and he told me when we started getting close he had a psychotic break a couple years ago. He often has what I think by looking into it is internal audio hallucinations. He says it’s kinda like a loud concert or a packed ball room. Sometimes certain things will pop out at him like certain sentences. He says sometimes it will just snap and go quiet for a second and wants to know how to have that happen for consistently. When he is focused or distracted he says he doesn’t hear it as much/at all. This has been most of his daily life for the past 4-5 years he has been hearing that. He has had psychotic breaks in the past and has had some visual hallucinations. They stress him out. I think the biggest fear is having an episode again. He was prescribed some medicine but never given a proper diagnosis. He was prescribed Seroquel and Quetiapine. He doesn’t take medication anymore because he says it makes him feel “brain dead” but it did make the stuff stop. \n\nI wanna know how can I support him? I really care about him and I just want him to be happy and safe. Sometimes it worries me, makes me a little nervous but I think that’s my own inherent biases about schizophrenia I am trying to get over. He is honestly so sweet to me and treats me so kind and with care. I’m not the most mentally healthy myself so he makes me feel seen and understood. I get worried that if I push too much about getting back on meds or seeing a doctor it may push him away. Also it’s not realistic for his financial situation rn.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "There is no link, speculative or otherwise.\n\nThe only curious thing we know is that hormonal differences are why if affects women later and often less severely. Estrogen is neuroprotective and in *some* cases could possibly delay the onset or reduce severity. However, this is known due to research on gender differences in Schizophrenia and not any research relating to or involving transsexuals. Sure, you could probably infer some things from this, but it's never been tested in context. I couldn't think of any way to devise that kind of study that wouldn't be intentionally harming at least one cohort. Sure, gender dysphoria and transsexuality is taxonomically a medical disorder with a known medical treatment, so there will also be scope for interaction with other medical disorders, but it's probably better thought of as developmental; an entirely different beast to the degenerative nature of psychotic disorders. If brain sex was equated with just which colour hair you happen to grow, psychosis would be your entire head rotting off. Sure, hair grows on your head, but your head rotting off isn't directly associated with having hair of a certain colour. It's natural human variation, versus horrifying disease, which affects humans. If this makes sense, I hope, I am awful want to ramble at times.\n\nIt's unfortunate that we find ourselves living under this current shadow of encroaching fascism. We currently have many people trying to find ways to label transsexuals as severely mentally ill, and equating them with things society already labels as 'dangerous'. They like to engage in all forms of academic dishonesty in the way they'll misrepresent studies, data points and quotes to further their agenda. All to build a narrative to justify the eventual genocide, which they covet so. Fascism literally wouldn't function without an 'enemy within' and scapegoat to control the masses through emotional manipulation. Brains are way too easily hacked. Make someone feel an emotional strong enough and it literally shuts down their frontal cortex. Which is to say, I would question the motives and integrity of anything written on this topic, more so than you would with any other piece of research. We're at the point where no amount of projected public respectability of anybody with academic status can guarantee they've not been consumed by the cloud of hatred and anger. So many previously respectable people have come out on the side of hatred already. It's injustice that the enemy people are taught to fear is always the most vulnerable but also the essential nature of such things.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767967530.0, "id": "nylivev", "author": "Ninlilizi_"}

Which as that's also the primary receptor psilocybin binds to, I'd imagine it would make it do basically nothing, based on the math.\n\nAlso for those concerned, yes I was a psychonaut then unlocked a psychotic illness from it, and took a long break from substances to learn how to stabilize on meds. Now I try a few different things, some quite frequently like the THC edibles, I know it's quite risky and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone in my situation, but what can I say I know my mind pretty well and can recognize my psychosis triggers and onsets and somehow my meds kick in way earlier to treat bad trips then they really should.

In some people with paranoia and delusions, this mechanism can misfire and flag seemingly innocuous events as life changingly important.\n\n\nOne time walking in the street she passed a man who randomly half smiled at her as she passed and her brain decided this was basically more important to her than her wedding day.

It has to mean something. \n\n\nThat evening the house phone rang and when she answered, it was probably a robo caller or something gone wrong, but there was no response on the other end of the line, though she thought she almost heard a sound like someone going pfft. Her brain misfire again and flagged this with critical importance too and it also consumed her thoughts. \n\n\nNow I don't know if you have played memory tricks, but your brain really likes to attach memories together, it makes them easier to recall. In this case both these memories became entangled. Who called and why? It was that man from earlier wasn't it.

Looking back at how her symptoms played out along with her simultaneous substance abuse and unemployment, he tends to place fault on her for the disorder. Generally, I think people without personal experience have little understanding. I just explained to him again I have not read any medical journals that can say - was the disorder always there and the drugs shook it loose, or did the drug itself organically cause the disorder. There is a lot of \"she won't take her meds\" and I have to remind repeatedly how anosognosia impacts this decision \"like dementia\" which seems to be more understood. There is just a lot of ignorance, and I wouldn't be surprised if it is increased with those in his generation (Baby Boomers) when inhumane state sanitariums still existed.\n\nNow my sister's son (30) also has schizoaffective disorder. Dad doesn't know about his meth use prior to his diagnosis. He sees a young man who served in the military and holds a job. Doesn't seem to have the disdain for him, that he does for his daughter. Even though I've educated Dad over the years about what is known and it's causes, he still has the bias. \n\nI don't think my dad is generally unkind. But I do think he would say something similar to what your dad said. However, I think it is more from the - what is going to happen to my daughter (he still financially supports her) after I'm dead and gone? His daughter who has been homeless, has a history of setting homes/electronics on fire, is probably going to get evicted again, and will eventually be an old woman with nowhere else to go but the street? I think there might actually be a bit of compassion there wondering of her safety and well-being. Hopefully I haven't offended anyone by this perspective.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "My reality, as I experience it, shows me that this feeling—and I don't really like to admit this—is often true for me. I'm not happy about it, and how could I be? Nobody likes feeling bad. I try to work through it on my own with a bit of help from others, but I don't always succeed.\n\nWhat I try to tell myself is that everyone is different, with their own strengths, weaknesses, worldviews, and feelings. Just because I see the world a certain way, feel it, and have an opinion doesn't mean that everything I do is right, and perhaps this is a starting point for healthy self-doubt, which can create space for a perspective in which I can experience myself as less deficient.\n\nMy difficulty lies with my brain, which puts obstacles in my way, makes little seem worthwhile, and makes it hard for me to take action. But, and this is precisely my point, completed activities are anything but useless. It's especially gratifying if I can record any successes, however small, as such, and if they bring me recognition, perhaps even from others.\n\nI should add that I am against judging people solely on their performance. There needs to be a balance between performance in relation to ability and a healthy self-assessment. That's quite a lot to ask and expect, and it's really about the feeling of not living up to one's own expectations and the demands the world places on one.\n\nAside from that, what can you do today that's achievable and represents a small goal that makes you feel good about having taken another step towards your goals? Do that as often as possible, and you'll see in retrospect that your life hasn't changed for the worse, and you might even feel differently about your situation.\n\nThere's bound to be something there, and those who seek will find. It's worth a try because even with setbacks, which are in a way a learning experience, you'll still progress.

However, since having an episode a year ago, I stopped smoking for 6 months. I continued having symptoms until being put on meds for 3 months and they dropped considerably. My psychiatrist approved me going off them to see what would happen. I still haven't seen or heard anything, I occasionally have internal auditory hallucinations but nothing too serious and no crazy delusions (I had really bad delusions that I was being targeted.)

But I use cannabis to medicate and have not found a good replacement for it. \n\nEven before my episode I had been a heavy cannabis smoker from age 20-26, this is the first episode ive ever had so i find it odd that it didnt present itself sooner if it is drug enduced psychosis.

I know nobody can diagnose me, just wondering if anyone had a similar experience with thinking it was drug induced when it maybe actually wasnt, or has any idea what COULD be going on even if it's just a guess I can do some research about. I am not as educated about this as I would like to be.\n\nNote: I have a family history of depression and of members of my family seeing ghosts but nobody is diagnosed schizophrenic.

That's with the meds keeping it dulled just enough to be able to get up, shower and get dressed each day. Huge step up from hiding in bushes.

Thoughts become fragmented and rapid, but often useless because they're incomplete and random and only loosely related to previous thoughts or events.\n\nIt also removes one's ability to feel others' emotions with them, makes it extremely difficult or impossible to concentrate on important tasks, intelligence often takes a hit, and people will withdraw from the world due to inability to understand and relate to others since a schizophrenic's internal world is so far removed from reality.\n\nIt's arguably the worst mental condition to have, and unfortunately it starts very early in life (teens-30s) when people are trying to go to school, raise a family, and build their career.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "title": "My life is good and it genuinely upsets me when I think about it", "text": "I’ve never put the whole story down like this before and it feels weird even typing it out, but I’m tired of carrying it alone and wondering if I’m the only one who’s been through something this messed up and mismatched. I’m not here to brag or play the victim, I’m just trying to see if anyone else recognizes parts of this. When I was a kid a test said my IQ was 189 and I didn’t really get what that meant but suddenly teachers and family started talking like I was going to be some big success story with good colleges and an important career and all that, putting this quiet pressure on me that I never asked for. High school was the complete opposite: every single class, every report card straight Fs, not one grade above an F ever, I barely turned anything in, skipped a ton, and when I did show up I was usually high as hell because I got hooked on heroin pretty early in high school and was doing a ton of other drugs too, whatever I could get pretty much every morning before school. I told myself it helped quiet the voices and the paranoia that were already starting but really it just made everything ten times worse while the schizophrenia was kicking in hard with constant noise in my head, feeling like everyone was watching or plotting against me, days where nothing felt real. Between the drugs, the symptoms, and how pointless school felt I didn’t even try. Why bust my ass for grades when my brain was already screaming and the whole world seemed fake anyway? I got in fights all the time too, my brain would twist something small into a threat or I’d misread a situation completely and I’d just snap, senior year it finally caught up with too many fights and they expelled me, but the very next day still mad and doped up I walked into the GED place on a whim with no studying or prep and got perfect scores on everything. Because of those straight Fs and the way I acted pretty much everyone who knew me figured I was just dumb. Teachers said it straight up, kids threw it around like it was obvious, counselors looked at me like a lost cause, and that part hurt more than I admitted back then because it wasn’t that I couldn’t do the work. I could sit down and write a decent essay or figure out complicated stuff pretty easily if something actually grabbed my attention, the problem was never being “slow,” it was the noise in my head, the drugs, the total lack of focus, and honestly not caring enough to fight through it. While all that was going on I was also the kid always trying to make everyone laugh, I’d do whatever stupid thing popped into my head like weird voices, dumb impressions, random chaos in the middle of class. I didn’t feel embarrassment like most people do, if it got a laugh I didn’t care how ridiculous I looked, a lot of it was probably just coping because when people are laughing things feel less heavy for a minute, but that same no-filter attitude got me in trouble too as jokes would go too far and it’d turn into another fight. I’ve been clean from heroin and the heavy stuff for years now, it was a long ugly road to get there and I don’t talk about it much, the schizophrenia is still here with meds and therapy helping but it’s always in the background making steady anything tough. These days I mostly keep to myself when I’m not on the road. I taught myself programming because it’s one of the few things my brain can lock onto when the fog lifts, got comfortable with a bunch of languages over time, built a few small operating systems from scratch just as personal projects, mess around with computers, make some simple game mods that a handful of people use, and do a little ethical hacking on the side like bug bounties and stuff, it’s quiet work I can do alone on my own schedule. But the thing that actually changed everything is the band, I’m the lead singer and guitarist in a Midwest emo band that went viral out of nowhere with one song blowing up on TikTok then the whole album following, now we tour damn near nonstop, sell out venues, have millions of streams, and yeah I make a shit ton of money from it, comfortable doesn’t even cover it anymore, and that same chaotic zero-shame energy I had in high school translates straight to the stage where I pour everything into the performance, it's like I’m exorcising something, and I connect with the crowd in this raw way that apparently resonates with fans... They tell me the music helped them through their own dark shit which feels good on the days I believe it. Here’s the part that still fucks with my head: back when I was at my lowest, using every day, getting expelled, no one believing in me, pretty much everyone who knew me dropped me hard, old friends stopped answering texts, people I thought were close acted like I didn’t exist, girls I liked ghosted, even some family kept their distance, I was the town screw-up and the cautionary tale, nobody wanted to be associated with the junkie who couldn’t pass a single class, then the band went viral and overnight my phone started blowing up with messages from every single person who’d gone silent years before, suddenly everyone wanted to talk, hang out, “catch up,” people who hadn’t spoken to me since high school sliding into DMs like we’d been best friends all along, girls who wouldn’t look at me back then reacting heart eyes on my stories. It was wild how fast the switch flipped, same guy same past but now that there’s money and attention attached everybody’s on my dick acting like they never left, it’s hard not to feel cynical about it, I’m grateful for where I am now and performing helps me channel a lot of the chaos in a healthier way but that sudden 180 from people still stings and makes you question who’s real and who’s just chasing whatever’s shining at the moment. I guess what I’m asking is has anyone else dealt with a life that felt this contradictory, tested “gifted” but completely fell apart in school, mixed serious mental illness with heavy drug addiction especially something like heroin, got written off as dumb or hopeless even though you knew you weren’t, ended up in a creative field that actually took off big, and then had everyone who dropped you during the dark times suddenly act like your biggest fan once things turned around? Even if just parts match up I’d really like to hear it, it’d help to know I’m not the only one who’s been through this particular kind of chaos.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "schizophrenia", "text": "I wanna first say all the self learning tech stuff is pretty cool, especially the OS systems. Some of my story aligns with yours. I was what some would call gifted before the illness. Not in an IQ test but I was always near the top of my class in GPA rank and was involved in every organization in high school, so I met lots of people and made friends while being mostly introverted. Senior year, had a psychotic break, and my life slowed down a lot. Didn't do anything notable for about 2 years and lost all of my friends except for a few who happened to be incredibly caring people. Had a brief moment of triumph: I went to community college and transferred to a top 10 school in the world for aerospace engineering, but failed out after 3 long years. Here is where our story differs: I have never done drugs except smoking weed once, and I have not had a huge success story yet. I think I could have one in the future as I have ambitious ideas, but thats not important. I have thought about the scenario, what if all my former friends tried to  re-enter my life because I did something important? Examples: I'd like to write a book, or maybe uncover something about the Navier-Stokes equations. \n\n\nWhat would I do? My brutal answer is I wouldn't let them, or mainly keep them at arms length. Part of it is instinctual: even before my illness I am NOT WILLING to give people second chances if they committed a big transgression, and I think the scenario we are talking about counts. But I have more reasoning: yes, people with the illness are hard to interact with, but its not an impossible task, because there were people who made the effort to make sure I was okay even in the darkest of times. My entire family supported me, and as I mentioned earlier a few friends did too. \n\n\n\nThe question I want to ask: did anyone stick with you through it all?  some of my closest high school friends were not that interested in keeping contact anymore. With the exception of 1, a really empathetic friend who grew up to be a doctor. I love him a lot because he's the rare exception along with my family who never thought to disown me. Over the years my friend and I never stopped talking and I ended up getting to meet a lot of his new friends even though we have not lived in the same city in almost 10 years. \n\nIf the answer is no, I am sorry. I think all of us with this illness will develop trust issues even if that should not be the case. But there ARE people you can trust even after illness, despite what some might say. Hopefully you have met them. Maybe your band is worth trusting. If you haven't, there will always be time. But you can't revert to the friends who disowned you, because that is essentially trying to travel to the past. That is impossible-both physically but in a metaphorical sense emotionally. Even if it feels good to reconnect intially, I think the resentment will always be there which can be unhealthy to let seep into your mind. \n\nOne final thing I'll say is context matters, maybe you weren't particularly close with the people you are mentioning? Like they knew you but maybe they didn't feel close to you way back when. If thats the case then it might be worth forming bonds because they are technically fresh friendships anyway. \n\nI feel like I rambled some.

It wasn’t until my antipsychotic and mood stabilizer were adjusted that I could see a bit more clearly so to speak. The psychosis especially. It’s still not great but I can actually recognize me being responsible for the doom of humanity and am being hunted down as a result is kind of ridiculous even if I still get scared and paranoid because of it. I ended up homeless for a few months because my mom had had enough. I ended up in the psych ward after and on new meds and ended up in transitional housing. Was stable for 5 months before things crashed again this fall. Events lead to me being diagnosed. Unfortunately a lot of it is complying with treatment so a group home or care facility with a court order for treatment will probably be best but the only way to really do that is to prove he can’t make his own decisions and be safe and apply for adult guardianship. I understand the loneliness and as he eases in it should get better especially if he gets better as wel. But you’re likely gonna have to force him and he won’t be happy.

My sister has schizoaffective disorder and substance abuse, and right now my parents (late 70s) are the buffer, from an hour away distance from her. (I'm not there.) My sister is in her 50s and has repeatedly been evicted and homeless. The husband usually precedes the wife in death, and my dad has kept my sister out of their home (she set fire and destroyed a home we got her due to hallucinations) because she could be dangerous, despite my mom pleading to take her in. My dad and I have talked about what will happen when he's gone, as we believe my mom will then take her (and her drug addiction) in. I don't live in the area, but also fear for my mom and wonder what I will be faced with.\n\nI have been the buffer for my parents regarding my sister's children - her son with schizoaffective disorder, and daughter with bipolar 2. I've flown to their states when they have been in mental health crisis and practically collapsed with exhaustion when they both had serious issues within the same month. That is when I realized I really needed to figure out my boundaries because it was slowly breaking me. I realize you are in a different living and financial arrangement and that challenge will present you with hard decisions e.g., realize you can't love or money anyone to save them, abandon ship, get a roommate somewhere else. I know this sounds cruel and would be heartbreaking for you. I am at that juncture in a way myself, trying to figure it out. It's like you either save yourself, or drown with them.\n\nAbout a group home, my sister checked herself out. She doesn't like living with other people. She doesn't trust them, sees blurred faces or cannot recognize them or they look like other people. We cannot force her to get treatment nor can she be held anywhere long term against her will.

The problem is that he started to talk about how he is getting chase by the mafia. The issue is. I know he had some debt, which was weird because he had unemployment benefit and I didn't unterstand how he could get credit. \n\n  \nHe was posting very detailed description about who was hunting him but at the same time he sounded a lot like ***c***onfabulating. A lot of things sounded contradictory. \n\n  \nNow I never tought that someone could deteriorate so fast by using drugs and that scares me. I took drugs in the past mainly weed and had at least one or two psychotic events (paranoia mostly). But it never developed into something more severe. Even tough I had some trouble concentrating or remembering and also felt a long time as if I am not fully \"Inside\" myself.\n\n  \nNow because of the things he said I became a bit paranoid too. Like at the beginning I wasn't sure if he was actually getting hunted or not, which would put people around him in danger. He broke of relationships and basically was all alone with this. Because of the way he died, it did seem as if someone killed him  which was scary to all of us. \n\n  \nNow my question is this: How can someone differentiate between \"normal\" paranoid thoughts and knowing that it's pathological? Is awareness even possible in this case? \n\n  \nHere are some examples:\n\nThe last months before I had the conclusion of the police I was looking outside the windows thinking what If they are going to go for his friends too? \n\nI felt like someone might be at the door today, simply because I couldn't see well.\n\nI lock my bedroom door, basically \"Just in case\" someone breaks in. Thinking that it's a rational thing to do while also beeing afraid that I am getting more and more paranoid. \n\nIs there a \"normal\" amount of paranoia?

She writes like no tomorrow. I never took the time to read what she wrote, too much religious stuff can be triggering for me depending on the context, but at worst it at least seemed to give a place to put the delusions, if present (she was well medicated from dx to death with Invega), so I don't see a grand negative.

Now I could just do my thing without feeling those things, I even had a beer in one of the restaurants on my own, something I'd never dare to do on Risperidon. There weren't a lot of people that day so that helped but still.\n\nIn hindsight Risperidon never really did much in helping my symptoms, I've had that suspicion for months, but just gave me a lot of side effects. I thought it at least kept the peace in my head but that just turned out to be brainfog.\n\nAnd worst of all if I may add this, recently that brainfog and the visions caused me to be distracted at a crucial moment and I caused my best friend at the time to fall with her wheelchair. The paranoia and anxiety that followed caused me to completely ruin our friendship and we're not friends anymore. I don't blame the meds for this, I only have myself to blame but knowing what I know now I doubt that would've happened if I switched to Abilify sooner.\n\nSo to end this post I'll say this, if your meds no longer seem to be working and a higher dose doesn't fix it, maybe something else will help you.

While the meds have helped control many of his symptoms, they have caused significant weight gain, which has been really hard on his mental health and self-esteem.\n\nThe most concerning part is that he self-harms. In the last six months alone, he has had two surgeries due to cutting too deeply. It feels like we are constantly holding our breath, worried about what might happen next.\n\nOver the years, we’ve tried a lot. Multiple inpatient hospitalizations, outpatient programs, and different providers. In his 20s, when he was unmedicated, he struggled with substance use and went through several rehab programs. At this point, it feels like nothing has truly helped in a lasting way.\n\nWe are scared because this can’t continue, and we love him so much. I know I’m leaving out a lot of details, but I’m hoping to hear from anyone who has been through something similar either personally or as a caregiver.\n\nDid anything help you or your loved one in a meaningful way?

If you can relate to my vague description perhaps you should try it for 6 months", "text": "Ever since I got sick with schizophrenia I've felt physical slightly/moderately sick in a way I could never describe. And I could never point to any area of my body it comes from. Only physical thing I feel is a sort of pressure on top of my head as if there's 2 books stacked on top pressing down.\n\nEver since I was a baby I've been subconciously holding my breath for a bit whenever I felt bad/sick/pain and the sharp exhales. And when I got sick with schizophrenia I started doing that permanently almost without noticing or doing it on purpose. I know I feel bad, just not what or where it is.\n\nI read a study with schizophrenics who tried 1st and 2nd medicine and 3rd ended on clozapine with not enough effect. So they tried giving them 2000mg NAC and after 6 months they saw good significant change in PANSS test score. Since it's safe to take and not that expensive I ordered a bunch and started taking it without knowing what I was trying to fix.\n\nAfter taking it about 4 months I ran out of pills, shrugged and thought \"oh well, i tried\" and threw the empty bottle out without further thought. A week later I was in the living room with my mom and she says to me \"you're breathing that way again now, you haven't done that in a while\" and I started thinking what could have made that change... i had forgotten slightly about NAC but after some digging I thought I'd order some more. And sure enough after a week or two of continuing the NAC the breathing thing stopped again. And it's been like 80-90% better while taking it. And I feel less sick in that vague way and less pressure on top of my head.\n\nNeuroinflammation is implicted in SOME versions of schizophrenia and NAC is a potent anti-inflammatory that can cross the blood-brain barrier. 2000 mg per day should be a safe dosage. Some experience some mild GI issues so maybe start slow.\n\nBut all in all I would recommend virtually anyone with schizophrenia to try it out for a long time (study I read saw no real difference after 2 months but significant change after 6 months). So perhaps order enough for 2000mg per day for 6 months and keep taking it. Then re-evaluate. For me it was nessecary to quit the NAC and see the much-quicker-than-6-months return of the symptoms. I was unable to register the slow positive change while it occured (I also have big issues feeling myself internally or understanding what I feel, so this is expected for me).\n\nBest wishes", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767678827.0, "id": "1q5aid1", "author": "Xabster2", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/schizophrenia/comments/1q5aid1/im_taking_1800mg_nac_supplement_every_day_and_it/"}

After my first episode, I worked in inpatient settings before leaving to do a PhD. I later relapsed and eventually returned to an inpatient role. I use this timeline to look at what it’s like to move between these positions, what in services has changed over time, what hasn’t, and how I’ve learned to live with my condition over the past ten years.\n\nThe series is reflective and experience-based. It’s not an ongoing project or a general theory, but a bounded archive of observations intended to help patients and mental health professionals feel recognised in aspects of their experience.

I overcame this by remembering that everyone you talk to online is a real person too. Try to envision yourself chatting with this person online, and if you can, try visualizing what they said as text in your mind, and imagine what you'd say. It's not easy, and it takes baby steps at first, but I promise you it's not that bad once you start realizing that you can do it! Also remember that most people aren't judging you, and they're also subconsciously worried about themselves as well, so it's not just you! That's why selfie Sunday is important, because it puts a face behind these words we text online. You got this!! Happy Monday!!!

I used to be very monotone and could not pair facial expressions, body language, or tone with my feelings at all. You just have to practice on people and start with small talk with cashiers when you're checking out, etc, and really put an effort in to study people in conversation and try to replicate others you're around, and that will teach you how to match the social energy of those around you.

I’ve been smoking marijuana daily for the past ten years. I’m 32 now. I can’t quit because my partner uses around me. Because I am on Risperidone, even when I smoke I experience mild auditory hallucinations. When I smoke I experience some relief for a little bit, but the delusions is what I struggle with. FBI, demons, thought broadcasting, paranoia, feeling like a powerful force. I usually smoke indica or hybrid. I smoke the flower and I vape. The flower thc I usually get is around 20%. But vaping thc is usually 80%. So vaping is a lot stronger. I’m doing both. Everyone wants me to quit because they’re afraid I might do something out of character. If you are diagnosed and have never started weed, I honestly wouldn’t recommend it. Some people don’t think it’s addictive, but it definitely can be… psychologically. I know a lot of individuals with psychotic disorders use substances to cope with symptoms. Im one of those people. But in the long run it hurts you. I’m always using weed to change the way I feel, it’s not a good way to live. Weed is the reason I have all the issues I have. At one point it was fun, probably my early 20’s, but now, it’s more like a slow nightmare. Not to mention to that it gets expensive buying weed all the time.

I honestly don't know how the switch would happen, the process to include abilify and reduce olanzapine.  Mine was for totally going off olanzapine with no other antipsychotic.
