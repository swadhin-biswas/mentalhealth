{"type": "post", "subreddit": "ADHD", "title": "ADHD and thoughts/verbal organisation: jumpy speech, poor working memory, and feeling overstimulated in some conversations", "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m curious about how ADHD affects thought organisation, working memory, and feeling overstimulated around people.\n\nMy attention often feels “on,” but information doesn’t stick. I can listen or read with genuine focus, yet a few seconds later it’s gone. I often have to reread things because they don’t register. It feels less like an attention issue and more like working‑memory overload.\n\nThis gets worse when I’m anxious, mentally busy, or uninterested in the topic. It’s like my working memory is already full, so new information has nowhere to land.\n\nSpeech is another challenge. My speech can be rushed, jumpy, high-pitched or disorganised, especially in some meetings or under pressure. I know what I want to say, but it comes out fragmented, as if my thoughts and mouth aren’t synced.\n\nSocial interaction and busy environments are overstimulating. After long conversations or banter with colleagues, I feel mentally “too active and all over the place internally. When this happens(overstimulated), my organisation drops, my speech becomes more chaotic, and it’s hard to refocus on tasks. I enjoy people, but the amount of input can overwhelm my brain.\n\nI’ve also noticed I can control my speech and pitch, but only for limited periods. Unmedicated, I feel calmer for about 30–90 minutes after waking. On medication, that window lasts around five hours. It feels like the ability is there, but stamina and regulation are the issue. With a few specific people, I’m also more able to slow down and organise my thoughts and sound less high pitched \n\nSo I’m wondering:\n\n • Does this feel more like a working‑memory issue than an attention issue for you\n\n• Do busy social environments overstimulate you\n\n• What strategies, therapy, coaching, or environmental changes have helped\n\nMy brain feels fast and capable, but the “buffer” between thinking, organising, and speaking is tiny. I’d love to hear what’s helped others manage.

After stopping the medication and giving my body time to recover, I feel much more like myself - but I’m still left with long-standing questions about ADHD.\n\nI’m starting over and would really appreciate hearing from people who struggled to get a diagnosis (or never did), or who had traumatic experiences with the mental health system.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Please be aware that that object permanence is the understanding that something continues to exist even if you aren't looking at it. It's part of early childhood development, not ADHD. It's why babies get so surprised if you play peek-a-boo; you cover your face and they legitimately don't realise your face still exists.\n\n[People with ADHD can have difficulty with working memory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10802-013-9729-9), but when we forget about something, we still know it exists. i.e., parking your car outside and then entering your house means your car is no longer in sight - but you know it will still be there the next morning, even if you forget where you parked it. Without object permanence, once the car leaves your sight it no longer exists.\n\nThis difference may seem subtle, or semantic even, but it's important we don't attribute false symptoms to an already misunderstood disorder. Working memory dysfunction is a known part of ADHD, that has been studied and written about.\n\n^(*A moderator has not removed your submission; this is not a punitive action.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "I don't know your budget or circumstances, so I am going to share what has helped me, or what I would like to have if I could.\n\n\nEntrance chaos: \n\n- A wardrobe/closet in the entrance. It needs to have doors, because a hanger will just accumulate all your coats and will create visual clutter. It doesn't have to be fixed or fancy, you just need to have the space for an Ikea Pax, for example. \n- Also in the entrance, a small shelf where you can leave your keys. If you always leave them there, you are less likely to lose them. Bonus points if there is an outlet so you can have a phone charger there. If you get used to leaving the phone there charging when you get home, your will run out of battery less often.\n\n\nFor clothes and laundry:\n\n\n-In my experience, doing laundry is easier if the washing machine is in the same floor.  If you don't have a dryer, make sure you have a place to put a drying rack\n\n\n-Think about the type of clothes you use and what storage you need. If your clothes need go be hanging, you will need hanging space. However, if you wear mostly sweaters, t-shirts, etc. You will need shelves. Search for closets that aren't very deep (Ikea Pax or similar). If you have space for two rows of clothes, you will need to move them around when reaching something, and it will end up being messy. \n\n\n- If you get a wardrobe, don't forget the doors. Yeah, I tried the \"if I see it, I will make sure it is tidy\", and it didn't work. Havig doors reduce visual clutter, which will reduce your self-destructive thoughts.\n\n\n- It's not about the space, it's about the routines that create chaos. When you change clothes, hang them. If you don't, you will accumulate clothes until one day you get the strength to tidy. And in one week you will have the same issue because your chair or your floor have become the closet. If you have the proper storage (enough drawers for underwear, enough shelves for t-shirts and trousers, etc.) and you make the effort to hang clothes EVERY day, I promise you you will be able to control it.\n\n\nCleaning and storage:\n-How much space do you truly need? Even if you can afford a mansion, can you afford someone to clean it? Because dust appears out of nowhere. So I would leave open shelving to the most vital things you actually need to see to remember. But those fancy places you only use once a year? If they are on display, they will accumulate dust. So in this case, closed storage is a better option.\n-If you can afford it, hire someone to come once a week to clean the bathroom and the kitchen, and just vacuum the place. It's well invested money.\n-If you have a friend or family member who wants to give you a fancy housewarming gift, think about a really good vacuuming robot. Not the basic ones, but one that has a lot of storage for dust and empties itself. Because let's be honest, you are going to forget about emptying.\n-If the house has the garbage can inside a drawer, that's great. But make sure it's big enough or you will need to take out the trash every day. \n\n\nDecoration:\nWhite is great, but it shows dust. Also, if you have long hair you are going to be collecting hair all the time. Your floor may make it hard to see the hair. That's positive because you won't see a dirty house but negative because it will be hard to clean it. You may prefer being able to easily see the dirt.\n\n\nLocation:\nDo you struggle with being punctual? If so, I would try to live near my job, especially if it's a job I plan to stay at for a very long time. A shorter commute means less time being late if you oversleep or get distracted. And easy commute with reliable public transport, a gas station nearby for when you forget to fill your tank, etc. Also, do you want to live near a supermarket that opens long hours? A place where you can get your groceries delivered to?  If you want to hire someone to clean the house, can they get there easily?\nIs noise important to you? This goes two ways: you may need silence at night, so avoid areas where people go partying. But also, are you likely to be working on a noisy job in the middle of the night?

I tried bro, I thought I was the issue, I thought if I just worked a bit harder or tried a little more maybe I could do it.

I have no idea what happened. I am on numerous psych meds and it can make me very sick to double a dose, and I go through withdrawals and get psych symptoms if I miss a dose. So to err on the side of caution, I didn't take the one I had checked as taken or the other one I think it was likely to be that was at the top of the bag. I did take the one that was off to the side of the bag that I don't think I took. It's possible I double dosed it, but not likely.

It's helped me a lot with time management and not missing meetings.\n\nHi everyone! I wanted to share a tool I built that's been really helpful for managing my schedule and dealing with time blindness. Full disclosure - I'm the creator.\n\nI was constantly missing meetings or being caught off guard because I'd lose track of time. Regular calendar apps just show you a list, but I needed something more visual and attention-grabbing. I also have ADHD, and constantly checking \"when is my next meeting?\" was distracting me from actual work.\n\nSo I built \"Is it time yet?\" - a web app that connects to your Google Calendar and shows your upcoming events with big, colorful countdown timers. The timers change color based on how soon the event is. Blue means you have plenty of time, yellow means it's getting close, and red means it's happening now or you're already late. You don't have to constantly check your calendar because it's always visible, which reduces decision fatigue. There are audio pings and screen flashes when meetings are approaching, so you don't need to remember to check or calculate \"how long until X?\".\n\nIt's completely free and web-based. No app to install, just visit https://isittime.app/ and connect your Google Calendar. I built it for my own use a couple years ago and I've been using it daily for a couple years now, and it's genuinely changed how I manage my schedule. Having that constant visual reminder has reduced my anxiety about missing meetings and helped me stay more present in whatever I'm working on.\n\nI'd love to hear if this helps anyone else, or if you have suggestions for improvements!\n\nNote: I'm the creator of this tool. I'm sharing it here because it's been genuinely helpful for my own ADHD management. It's completely free with no strings attached.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768027816.0, "id": "1q8x8nv", "author": "Cmaster11", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1q8x8nv/sharing_a_tool_thats_helped_me_with_time/"}

I’m inattentive type. I flew under the radar because I performed very well academically in high school. This created a sort of “academic expectation” which motivated me.

I felt like a fraud because behind the scenes, my behaviour and habits were abnormal and I was the only one that knew. It wasn’t until I started my law degree at university that my ADHD boiled to the surface. I was smart, but I wasn’t disciplined and very quickly fell behind my peers. I started failing assignments, then exams, then eventually entire subjects. I was forgetful and neglected to submit things on time. My 4 year degree turned into a 6 year degree. I watched people that I started law school with graduate before me and so on. I couldn’t maintain friendships. I didn’t have any hobbies. I had fleeting interests. I felt a lot of shame and often told a lot of lies to cover up what was going on. I felt fatigued all the time. I just couldn’t keep up anymore. I ended up seeing several psychologists and was eventually referred to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with ADHD and comorbid OCD. My psychiatrist was shocked that I managed to do so well at school, let alone complete a law degree…\n\nI’m now medicated and I’m learning about ADHD. I’m slowly making friends and finding hobbies.

In 6th grade I finished the whole math book during the first month, because I was just so bored at class. I finished a math test in less than 10 minutes and the teacher forced me to sit in class for over an hour because \"there's no way I'm going to get a good score doing it that fast\". Ended up in detention for disturbing the class during a test. I was just extremely bored and wanted to get out of the class as fast as possible. I got A from that test and didn't touch it after trying to return it the first time. Sounds like I had it pretty good, right? \n\nExcept then I got into high school and flunked out during the first year. And it has been downhill since then. Went to vocational school, failed. Tried another vocational school, failed that too. Took a year off school and tried to get a job, failed at that too. Back into vocational school, somehow managed to finish it that time.

I had thought about the possiblity of having it during my high school and vocational school years though. She started the testing process anyways, which required them to interview my mom. Turns out, my dad and sister has ADHD and no one ever told me about it. So yeah. Would have been nice to know that maybe 15 years ago.

Unless I was a dumbass, and I accidentally drank something with caffeine in it. I talked to her about these concerns, and told her I would be willing to try Vyvanse. My problem with that is I don’t like extended release stimulant medications, because I like having control over how I use my second dose. Sometimes I break it in half and take it 4 hours apart, or not at all. I go by my day, and how I am feeling. She told me that a lot of her patients have had a bad experience with it. That they have a bad crash at the middle, or end of the day so didn’t recommend it. So she ended up prescribing me a 30 day supply of Zenzedi 20 mg bid, which is the same as the Adderall. I was really surprised, and grateful she didn’t start me on a lower dose and titrate me up. If you have made it this far, thank you.❤️\n\nMy questions is as soon as she sent the prescription CVS said my insurance needs a prior authorization for it.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "I'm nearly 50 and a lawyer, and I still wrestle with this exact feeling. That gnawing sense that I'm supposed to be *someone*\\- that my name should mean something, that I should be exceptional, not just competent. And yes, I think it's absolutely an ADHD thing.\n\nWhen I was 21, I was grinding through bar exam prep, and honestly? Without that \"I'm destined for something bigger\" feeling, I don't think I would have made it through. The studying was brutal and mind-numbing, and my ADHD brain wanted to quit every single day. But that sense of being meant for more - that almost grandiose belief in my own potential - was the only thing that kept me going when the material felt impossible and my focus was shot.\n\nHere's what I've learned over the decades: that feeling isn't a delusion, but it's also not a guarantee. It's fuel. For people like us, we *need* to believe we're working toward something significant, or our brains just won't cooperate with the boring, necessary parts of life. The trick is learning to harness that feeling without letting it destroy you when reality doesn't match your 21-year-old vision.\n\nYou lost the athlete path and the Marines path - that's real grief, and I'm sorry. But that fire you feel, that certainty you're meant for more? Don't extinguish it. Channel it. Find something where that intensity has a home. University might not feel right yet, but you're still searching, and that's exactly what you should be doing at 21.\n\nThe feeling doesn't go away.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Absolutely, happy to elaborate.\n\nSo first, the practical stuff: I learned an affirmation technique years ago that sounds almost too simple to work, but it genuinely does. When you're facing something hard - an exam, a difficult conversation, whatever makes your ADHD brain want to flee - you repeat in your mind: \"I can do this because...\" and then you finish it with something true about yourself. \"I can do this because I'm capable.\" \"I can do this because I've overcome harder things.\" \"I can do this because I'm disciplined when it matters.\"\n\nThe key is repetition. Your brain will throw fear at you, it'll flood you with doubts and distractions and every excuse to quit. Those thoughts actively impair your performance. The affirmation isn't about lying to yourself - it's about drowning out the trash thoughts with something more useful. I used this all through law school and still use it before big cases.\n\nBut here's the bigger picture of using that \"destined for more\" feeling as fuel:\n\n**You have to get comfortable with delayed gratification, which is hell for ADHD brains.** I wanted to be exceptional *immediately* at 21. But building anything meaningful takes years of doing things that feel beneath you. The fuel is remembering that the boring stuff is scaffolding, not the ceiling.\n\n**You need to protect the feeling from reality checks, but not from reality itself.** I've had colleagues tell me I'm \"too ambitious\" or that I should \"be realistic.\" Ignore that. But also don't ignore when you're actually failing at something or when a path genuinely isn't working. There's a difference between people doubting you and you lying to yourself.\n\n**Find a field where intensity is an asset, not a liability.** Law worked for me because the courtroom rewards that fire. For you, it might be something completely different.

Perhaps ADHD is holding us back and the severity is a case by case situation however I would think unless it's crippling to that extent those of us with minor to moderate levels of ADHD would still be able to have made a step towards that goal. Progress is all that matters, doesn't matter when it happens SO LONG as it is within a relatively reasonable amount of time. The longer it takes the more that claims starts to seem empty or at least unlikely. A pleasant thought.

For example, during a Pokémon combat I'd increase intensity. If something interesting is happening on an anime, I'd increase the intensity too.\n\nThis also gives you a structure of time. I don't measure my cardio in minutes, I measure it in chapters or episodes. \n\nAlso, try to do your cardio in the morning.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Honestly this sounds a lot like OCD (which is common with ADHD) not being able to stop thinking about something until getting reassured is a huge symptom. I had what my therapist called “thought loops” and I’d obsess over the same thing over and over like a broken record. I’d come to a resolution, be reassured, whatever it was, but my brain never registers it as handled.\n\nThe xanax has helped a lot when things are bad. my friend who was going through a period where she was asking friends for reassurance every 2 minutes in conversation takes a medication similar (but less addictive) and she’s calming down a lot. But Xanax is not a daily medication for me, I take it for panic attacks and times where these thoughts are impeding my ability to function. I’ve also just done a lot of work with my therapist and I journal often. The combination of this all has helped me learn to let go of thoughts that don’t serve me.\n\nLately I’ve been redirecting my need to intellectualize by thinking about what things I can start doing that do serve me.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Hello! I’m happy that you achieve your goal, but personally I have mixed feelings on this “living in the moment” thing, maybe you can shed some light on it? I feel that I’m always 80% in my head and 20% in the moment, and I’m analyzing / intellectualizing things all the time. It becomes more like 50/50 when I’m studying things (I.e. actively reading or watching materials), and I can only shut down my thoughts (or more like turn into 10/90 on average) when playing video games / reading brain-dead fictions / browsing porns / listening to certain electronic music. While living in the moment sounds like the right thing to want, the healthy and balanced way to go, I just don’t know what moments should I aim for? The eternal intellectualization feels like a defining feature of my existence. While sometimes it could be tiresome, like a part of me is craving to process something but the materials run out and I don’t have the mental energy to search for more, that I’d decide to go blank through means mentioned above, going blank doesn’t feel amazing either. Is this how meditation works? To help you go blank? Or there’s something else? Also I don’t know if this has something to do with my autism and alexithymia (disconnection from my emotions), but I just rarely if ever see the appeal of the presence or my surroundings.  The interesting things do not lie in the world, they lie in my conceptual playground and my model of the world. What’s the relief of landing in the present you’re talking about?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Hihi! Thank you for your thoughtful question! The answer is tricky, but here goes nothing: the purpose of meditation is not to help you go blank. The tricky part is that depending on who you ask, you’ll get a different “purpose.” I’m a Buddhist, I practice Buddhist meditation, and thus, my perspective on “living in the moment” is colored so! A great problem we experience today is that of Religious Eclecticism. The west’s understanding and concepts of meditation are a mishmash of different ancient lineages that have very specific differences. So now we have all these Eclectics walking around with no path laid out before them, yet they still persist upon instructing others. \nTherefore, I can only attest to Buddhist meditation. My brain is like a hamster on a wheel. It rapidly oscillates between states of craving, and states of aversion. Of course I enjoy many moments of thought, contemplating my interests, thought is not a bad thing in Buddhist meditation. Thought is welcomed to express itself, under the watchful eye of awareness however. One could most simply say that the purpose of meditation is to attain peace of mind. In Buddhist meditation, this is accomplished by bridging mind to matter: by focusing on the breath or the body, we disrupt the onslaught of thoughts. We observe the spark of mind meeting matter, of sensation, of perception. After some time, this experience reveals a state of consciousness that is not chasing craving, not fleeing aversion, just comfortably watching, like laying in the park on a summers day, watching the clouds roll by, with not a care in the world. It is in this state that the novelty of meditation is revealed. It can drastically alter your understanding of reality. I’ve done some of the most intense psychedelics known to man, and have had similar experiences completely sober in meditation. I love the feeling of the smallest particles of air flowing over my lip, as I want for nothing, a smile naturally unfolds across my heart. \nBut then, thoughts return. Almost explosively, as if to make up for their lost time. As they should! This is the way it naturally progresses. And this is the dance of meditation. It takes a lonnnnng time to train the mind. Heck, you’ve been training it to be the way that it is every day of your life. My two cents, in the word of my teacher, only accept what’s logical to you. I respect your statement of having mixed feelings. I’m glad to hear your in touch with the sense of what’s important to you. I believe that by doing that, a person can attain peace of mind. That being said, I am biased towards the Buddhist path, of which the ultimate purpose is to achieve nirvana, that is to perceive that state beyond mind and matter. And if you’re not a Buddhist, I think that “living in the moment” can be host to many more explanations that could offer peace of mind. Perhaps you feel it naturally, after another full day frolicking in the garden of your mind :)", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768018055.0, "id": "nyq9zqq", "author": "respawngopo"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Thanks for your long and thoughtful response! I’m not a Buddhist, but I have a (low-key and not personal) interest in psychedelic experiences for a long time. More importantly, I have the impression that Mulamadhyamakakarika by Nagarjuna provides an ontology where all structures are empty; every perspective exists only in interdependency and there’s no sense to look into an ultimate substratum. This is consistent with my takeaways from modern physics and I’m passionate to explore more (it has been disrupted for reasons but still) in this regard. Anyway, I just want to say it seems that the meditation you described may work for me, and now I’m motivated enough to sort that into the “should explore when it feels like my brain would cooperate” category. One final question though: do you think meditation has any effects on you aside from feeling good in itself and serving as an efficient tool for resting and nervous system regulation?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "ADHD", "title": "Study method", "text": "I had really bad grades in primary school. Despite that, my parents and I decided to put me in a more academic high school that prepares students for university (not a vocational/blue-collar school).\n\nWhen I started, I had no idea how to study and didn’t really understand why I should care, other than social pressure not to be seen as stupid.\n\n(Side note: I wasn’t diagnosed with ADHD until around age 24.)\n\nIn my first year, I had the lowest grades and almost failed. I was allowed to continue but was formally advised to leave the school.\n\nIn the second year, the same thing happened. The solution was obvious: get better grades — but I had no idea how.\n\nSo I started writing cheat sheets for upcoming tests.\n\nAnd something strange happened: while writing them, I accidentally started thinking about and memorizing the material.\n\nFrom then on, I made summaries for every subject. Writing things down was the only way my brain actually processed what was being taught. Revising later never worked as well as the initial act of writing.\n\nAnother thing that helped was making bets with friends about who would get the best grades. The extra stimulation and reward pushed me to study.\n\nThis method worked all through high school. The only thing it didn’t help with much was reading entire literature books.\n\nI graduated high school mainly by writing everything down to force my brain to think and to create structured summaries for revision.\n\nWhen I got to university, I became very depressed because I couldn’t pass anymore and didn’t understand why. Eventually I realized the problem: the amount of material was too big and time-consuming to summarize everything like before.\n\nSo my questions:\n\n\t•\tCan other people with ADHD relate to this childhood and study method?\n\n\t•\tIs this a typical ADHD experience?\n\n\t•\tHow did you study before your diagnosis, and how did it change after?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": 1767996965.0, "id": "1q8m4nu", "author": "Legitimate_Kick_5628", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1q8m4nu/study_method/"}

It helps slightly if I do things that don’t require any brain power, but not much, tbh.

I tried going the first semester without medication, and it was *extremely* difficult. For my undergrad, I took Vyvanse, and it was great, but I can't take stimulants anymore because I am on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. \n\n  \nI am American but living in Mexico and I met with a psychiatrist this week to discuss my options. The doctor recommended atomexatine (Strattera). I'm feeling *really* nervous about starting this medication due to what I've read about the potential side effects, even though I know this is a risk with any medication. The doc said we'd start with 25mg for a few days, then switch to 50mg for a week before going up to 60mg. I've read that starting with a lower dose can lower the risk of side effects, although it does feel like a fast buildup. \n\n  \nI'm kicking myself for not starting this well before the start of the spring semester (I start Monday 1/12) just in case there are side effects, because I really can't handle things feeling worse than they already are (with ADHD and other health conditions). I'm scared too about possibly not being able to stop use immediately if it's not working for me (though some resources say you don't have to taper off, others do).\n\n  \nI can't decide if it's even worth it.

Which I don't have trouble believing, at all.\n\n10mg dosage is pretty low, TBH. It depends on body weight and size, but I assure you if you go off the meds you will see and feel a significant difference in your attention span. Talk with them about possibly splitting a larger dose, like 30mg, between a morning and noon dosage routine.\n\nIt will depend largely on your body's tolerance, what you're eating for breakfast and your intake of other drugs and foods.\n\nIf you drink caffeine, if you're taking magnesium, if you have a high protein breakfast, if you exercise, if you're not feeling well, if another of your drugs is a contraindication against Adderall.\n\nThe goal is not to get you \"sparky\" and energized, it's to keep your brain chemistry functional over the long-term. Adderall, for most people, is the best option for that, but the fact that it is in fact amphetamine salts also means that the path to getting there is also one that revs your heart rate higher than normal.\n\nI take 40mg of Adderall in the morning and 20mg at noon, ***if needed.***  The reason is because over the course of my life in my treatment, I have in fact built up a significant tolerance to adderall (and caffeine. And other stimulants. It's how it goes.)\n\nI assure you that your body building up a tolerance to a drug is in fact a thing that happens, much like building up an alcohol tolerance, or a nicotine tolerance.\n\nThis is an established thing that happens to people who take drugs regardless of whether that drug is a recreational one or a medical one. I suggest you continue with the medication you're on right now.\n\nIf you are actually concerned that what you are taking is not adderall, you can contact a local drug testing lab, or reach out to [DanceSafe](https://dancesafe.org) and other organizations that do drug testing. They can point you in the right direction to verify that your prescription hasn't been altered.\n\nI want to be clear: while there have been instances where suppliers and pharmacies have in fact mislabeled drugs or had a mixup (or in an extremely rare circumstance that was more or less immediately found out and corrected had had their supply stolen and replaced with placebo pills, which is why the drug is such a controlled substance with regulatory safeguards in place on its sale), 90% of the time it's:\n\n1. You built up a drug tolerance. It happens. Titrate up and talk with your care team, keeping them in the loop for any and all changes.\n\n9.9999999999% of the time, it's:\n\n2. The pills have a slightly different formulation. Keep taking them unless you develop a rash or allergic reaction.\n\n0.0000000001% of the time, it's:\n\n3.

People I know who have autism are keen observers of behaviours because it doesn’t come naturally to them at all, and there’s a lot of pressure to have an understanding. When it comes to care work there isn’t as much of a pressure (especially on men) to have those observational skills to anticipate the needs of others.

Plus it's not a drug of abuse. The cons are that many don't find it as effective as stimulants, and head to head trials confirm this.\n\nVyvanse is a less abusable form of Dexedrine. As a stimulant, it's a first-line treatment for ADHD and people generally respond well to it. It usually provides patients greater symptom control compared to non-stimulants. Cons are that it's a long acting stimulant that can mess with sleep, hunger, and other bodily signals. Also, vyvanse is known for it's smooth onset and \"crash\", but some people still don't respond well to the crash.\n\nA major benefit of non-stimulants and stimulants is that they can be combined together later on.

There are different diagnostic codes for different presentations, but those have to do with the type of symptoms, not the severity.

Recently, I noticed that some of what I am experiencing might be related to ADHD.\n\nAt school, I either get very high grades (9–10/10) or very low ones (3–4/10), with nothing in between. I often dive into new interests (music production, cinematography, coding, painting,astronomy, psychology, etc.), spending nights learning and creating, but I can’t keep them stable.\n\nI am focused on self-growth and ambitious. For years, I have tried to improve consistency, punctuality, and organization, but I saw no real improvement, which made me frustrated and angry with myself.\n\nMy family often gets mad at me for my chaos, but I genuinely cannot see it. For example, my brain skips steps like closing drawers. They say I have potential but that I am wasting it, and call me lazy.\n\nAll of this is badly affecting my mental health.\n\nI’ve also noticed other symptoms:\n\n    •\thyperfocus\n    \n    •\tinterrupting others\n    \n    •\teasy distraction\n    \n    •\tconstant stimming\n    \n    •\toverstimulation\n    \n    •\tsleep paralysis\n    \n    •\tanxiety\n    \n    •\trejection sensitivity\n    \n    •\tfeeling burdened by daily routines\n\nDespite this, I’ve managed on my own. My parents are not willing to let me take an assessment. I might convince them, but it would require opening up emotionally and could lead to conflict, which would hurt me.\n\nIf the result is negative, I’d feel like I wasted money.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Suffer.\n\nJust kidding. I've been dealing with this myself recently after like a decade of being on stimulants, in the last year or two I've been noticing the crash in evenings when the meds wear off. And God forbid I fail to take them on a weekend, I can do nothing but rot in between bouts of sleep. I barely feel human. So, skipping meds is barely an option, but I can definitely feel the difference when I come back to my normal dose after some time off...\n\nI've gotten some mileage out of splitting my normal dose into two half-doses. On weekdays I take 2 pills / a full dose &amp; function properly, on weekends I will take 1 pill / a half dose whenever possible. It's a compromise: neither a true medication fast nor full functionality. But at least I'm not a limp sack of flour on the weekends. Caffeine of course also helps me feel human, matcha in particular *rocks*. \n\nAnd as far as not emotionally feeling like a trash failure human being on the days when I do fully medication fast, or the half-dose/caffeine trick doesn't really work? I pretend I'm a cat. I'm so serious, I tell myself it's a \"cat day\" where I have small spurts of low-effort activity (eat some food, sit by the window, take a shower, play a game or read, etc.) interspersed with rest. I try not to put a lot of pressure on what I do, and none of it is an actual Task like cleaning, and none of it's mandatory either. I just let it happen-- and there's less guilt because I am a cat.

My doctor is very green when it comes to behavioral stuff so she mostly takes my opinions and presents then to a colleague and then agrees with me.\n\nFor anyone that didn’t really see results with Adderall or Concerta, what did you try next? I’ve been reading up on Straterra, but I’m not sure because of possible side effects people talk about. I’ve never been prone to negative side effects so it’s been surprising having such a sudden negative experience with this Concerta.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Yeah I think this can come from larger cultural influences (religion, peoples beliefs about things like class, morality, and also the expectations set by media depictions of people’s living spaces— in tv shows sets often show idealized homes that don’t look lived in. When real people’s homes are shown it’s often as part of sensationalism like reality tv, so it’s going for shock value if things aren’t sanitized, like think “Hoarders”)\n\nIn reality most people do not have perfectly clean and organized living spaces because well, living is messy, and keeping things clean is a lot of work. Some people can outsource that work through having money, other people distribute labor so one person has primary responsibility (ie a household where one person is the primary income and the other person handles the unpaid household labor), and everyone else has to kind of just figure it out. And if you have ADHD the figure it out is harder because things don’t come easily to you—maybe you weren’t taught the skills, maybe you couldn’t learn them because no one taught them in a way you could actually learn, maybe you forgot you learned, and maybe you get overwhelmed. Maybe other things about ADHD make your life chaotic at times. \n\nI believe the most important priority is keeping things safe and comfortable for yourself.  Especially if it’s just your own living space. \n\nWhere it can be an issue is if you live with other people who have their own needs. In which case we need to be respectful and compromise but so do they. In our house we have a rule that if I’m leaving things everywhere and it starts bothering my partner she will tell me and I will graciously accept that and clean the things up.

I know some people with ADHD who have a really difficult time cleaning, because it’s overwhelming. I know others who need to keep things really tidy, ironically for the same reason: mess is overwhelming. \n\nCleanliness shouldn’t be moralized, and I think looking at some of the links and stuff people have provided is a good start. When I go over to other people’s houses they have “mess.” But I don’t see it that way. There’s a pile of shoes by the door, some clothes on the floor etc. because someone LIVES here. It makes it feel like a home instead of a showroom. Social media has definitely pushed this idea that “cleanliness is closest to godliness” to the forefront because now people are just randomly showing strangers their house on the internet. You’re not SUPPOSED to show your house to strangers. It’s supposed to be a place you LIVE IN. \n\nSo if I go into someone’s house and they have paint everywhere, or scattered electronics that just tells me what they’re invested in. It gives me a window into their mind. Sometimes our mind is scattered. And honestly for me, organizing and creating systems for all my things helps me pick myself up and put myself together a little. But in a world where we’re constantly expected to be put together, having a space where you can BE scattered and have things in places that make sense for YOU is important. \n\nWe all keep our homes differently.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "You hate the fact that not exhibiting a socially acceptable norm is viewed as a negative. Which isn’t a bad thing in and of itself if you can deal with it. But unfortunately this doesn’t change the fact that it’s one of the rules of the game. If it does bother you may require some effort.\n\nCleanliness and tidiness are simply markers. Ones that are easy to understand by other people and which can signal various things depending on the context. \n\nIn a professional environment where personal familiarity is limited and people rarely have time to understand who you are these markers are a crude measure for health and hygiene (cleanliness) and executive function/self regulation/emotional bandwidth (tidiness). \n\nI think when these signals do not meet social norms it could be less about character and morality and more about peoples subconscious perception of safety. After all even those without ADHD  value and strive to create control over their environment, they just have an easier way with achieving this. And seeing someone struggle signals chaos. They can’t help it. To many Chaos represents lack of control and stability which in tern lowers their sense if safety/control. This leads to a more cautious interactions, especially when it’s not a personal relationship. \n\nOn the other hand i can also see how in close relationships same signals can lead to the other person struggling with acceptance. Whether it’s lack of understanding or inability to help it can lead to some level of distress to them. And how do people act when they can’t help a situation that they find distressing yet care about? They get frustrated. Even when they don’t mean to.\n\nSo at work it could signal chaos.\n\nAt home it can cause emotional distress.\n\nIn the end it’s about 2 things.\n\n1. It’s about them, not you per se. Humans are tribal/social animals where acceptance is important. So when someone exhibits characteristics outside of the accepted and more common norms it leads to friction.\n\n2. Communication. In the absence of understanding people who don’t know you are left with nothing but guesses. Some will use their personal reference point and make conclusions that are often uninformed. Others will take an easy route, don’t bother to guess at all and choose to put up a barrier, not their problem.\n\nThe above my opinions only. I may be totally off mark.\n\nBut I guess we have options.\n\nWith regards to 1, chaos, social norms and acceptance. You decide how important it is to you. The feeling of wanting to be accepted by the crowd is waaaay more powerful than the feeling of not willing to be receptive to someone who is different. If it’s important to you then you start thinking about your capacity to fit in. eg the smallest steps and clear not burdening communication. If it’s not and doesn’t bother you, then you don’t have a problem.\n\nWith regards to 2, communication, you decide how much the current perception/attitude bothers you. Think about whether or not there is enough understanding from others to warrant their behaviour. If you feel that “they don’t know what I’m dealing with, if only they knew” or if you feel that you are being judged harshly it’s not necessarily because people are “judgemental” in it’s negative definition. It’s because when lacking information they default to reading the crude primitive signals that align with social norms. \n\nBut most people have capacity to be kind, understand and accept. It’s just that they can’t be expected to guess correctly or have the energy to put two and two together. So if it bothers you you have an option to communicate to them, in a polite, non emotional and clear way the reasons for certain traits. You don’t owe it to anyone but it may make your life more peaceful and less prone to negativity. Harder to do in a work environment as it can impact your position. Basically don’t get frustrated expecting people to just get it.

When you’ve been crushed, betrayed, and stepped on enough times, isolation starts to feel safer than connection. I left home at 14, lived on the streets, fought through depression, and built walls so high that even I couldn’t climb them sometimes.\n\nThe truth is, when life forces you to kill your feelings just to keep going, social interaction becomes exhausting. It’s not that I don’t care—it’s that caring has cost me too much before. So I pull away, not because I want to hurt anyone, but because I’m trying to protect what’s left of me.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned:\n\nBe honest with yourself first. If you need space, take it—but don’t let isolation become your identity.\n\nStart small. One message, one call, even if it feels awkward. People who matter will understand.\n\nForgive yourself. Ghosting doesn’t make you a bad person—it means you’ve been through things most people can’t imagine.\n\nI’m still working on this.

I've tried to do my own research, but ultimately concluded asking here would be the best thing.\n\nI have a friend who I suspect may be mildly hypersexual, from what they keep telling me, and I wanted to see if that is actually the case.\n\nSaid friend is in the middle of male puberty, so naturally, hormones would be acting up, but the experiences they keep telling me they have seem so much more extreme and unbearable than my own back when I went through that.\n\nThey didn't feel comfortable coming here to ask themselves, so I'm asking for them while keeping them anonymous.\nAccording to conversations we've had, they're not like, constantly having horny thoughts? But they said they more or less spend a good chunk of their time feeling pent up, masturbating very often yet it feels like it's hardly any relief, and so aroused that it genuinely gets in the way of doing things at times.\n\nThey also stated that if they have something to distract themselves with, e.g. being on VC with a friend, then said arousal is more easily ignorable..for a while. They state that eventually, the arousal starts to \"take over\" to the point they genuinely have to stop and go take care of it.\n\nI didn't want to bother them too much with more questions, and I also didn't really know what else to ask, but based on this and just in general hanging out with them, all this stuff seems definitely not normal to me, even for being in the middle of puberty.\n\nThus, this post.

By eliminating possibilities you'll make the list of options smaller and hopefully get rid of some of the overwhelm.\n2. Try something, anything, and see how you get on. Once you've got rid of the definite \"no\" options, pick something to see what it feels like. Don't aim for perfect from the first step, just have a go at something. Adjust to being in work, the routine of it, then if you don't like what you're doing see what else is around. If you do like it, double down on it and try not to worry too much about the other options you \"could have taken\".\n\nI'm literally trying to do these two things myself right now and I'm terrible at following my own advice but the way I see it, sometimes the destination becomes clearer the closer we get to it.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767962059.0, "id": "nyl349x", "author": "SirFragworthy"}

Ever since I have been hyperfixated on ADHD and absorbing everything I could on the matter to learn and understand myself better - I have paired that with therapy and have come to the following conclusions.\n\nThere is absolutely a phase of grief that you go through after a later diagnosis and that is perfectly valid and okay. It is only natural to ask yourself what your life could have been if you found out about it sooner. And there will be a lot of memories you will reevaluate and understand that your behavior was not just \"your fault\", but that it was heavily influenced by something you didn't really know about and didn't understand. \n\nLearning about ADHD has been a ride for me, as the further I dug into it, the more I realized how complex psychology, neurochemistry and its effects on an individual are. \n\nThe only reason I got the diagnosis though was to get my hands on medication. 2 months after my diagnosis I was able to start my treatment and ever since my life has significantly improved in all areas. My symptoms got way better, some almost vanished now - even when my medication wore off.\n\nBut I do not think there is a direct correlation between your diagnosis and your symptoms intensifying. I think you are just a lot more sensitive to them, because you are a lot more aware now that you have your diagnosis. That was happening to me too, it was almost exhausting just how much of my behavior was clearly ADHD-related once I looked for it more.\n\nBut in the end, you are the same person that you have been before the diagnosis. A person capable of coming up with strategies for himself that work. Be kind to yourself, its a difficult time right now. That is the best advice I can give.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Probably a combination of factors:\n\n- Now that you know it's ADHD, you are more alert to possible symptoms, and notice more of them. So even if things aren't objectively getting worse, they *seem* worse, because you notice them more.\n- Getting diagnosed tends to produce a lot of emotions, and those take a toll on the brain. And as a general rule, whenever your brain is worn out, exhausted, or tired, ADHD symptoms tend to flare up, sometimes massively so.\n- A fresh diagnosis often also comes with revisiting your life choices, thinking about ways forward, going through therapy, etc., all of which take up brain capacity, and cause you to deviate (consciously or not) from your established routines. While many of those changes may be beneficial in the long run, \"it gets worse before it gets better\" applies to a lot of them.\n- Subconsciously allowing yourself to \"be more ADHD\" may also play a role. Before diagnosis, most of us assume that our experience is the same as everyone else's, and that bending over backwards to meet society's expectations is just normal; but once you know that that's not the case, allowing yourself to slack a bit more is a completely natural (and healthy) response. It's good in the long run, but until you have developed better (less exhausting) strategies for dealing with things, your \"performance\" (for lack of a better term) will be worse.\n\nJust understanding these factors is probably the biggest thing you can do to deal with it; the rest comes with time and practice.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767967549.0, "id": "nylixk2", "author": "tdammers"}

And it’s also not a binary thing and more of a scale or spectrum even. \n\nThe weirdest thing about ADHD is that it doesn’t really have any symptoms which would be strictly exclusive to it. The good side of that is that you can just consume regular self-improvement/therapy content and use that in your day to day. The bad side is that ADHD often gets misdiagnosed, especially because currently some well known ADHD symptoms are not recognized as criteria for a diagnosis. Emotional dysregulation being the most prominent example. Masking and coping can also problematic and aren’t taken into account at all. And some of the arbitrary rules like needing to affect aspects of life from the perspective of an outsider are just plain stupid. \n\nProbably the best way to truly get what ADHD is is to listen to stories of people (especially those with late diagnosis). There’s a relatively narrow range of stereotypes, many of which you probably will be able to relate to or even identify with.

I have so much  shame, self loathing, feelings of inadequacy, internalized homophobia and toxic masculinity, and I’ve been struggling with it my entire life.\n\nIf I’m left alone with my thoughts I quickly ruminate and spiral out of control, that’s usually why I doomscroll or game for hours at a time. It’s not even because I really enjoy it anymore, but it just quiets the voices in my head for a bit. Of course, that just creates a negative feedback loop of avoidance that doesn’t ever fix anything.\n\nI haven’t found out how to even be neutral towards myself yet, just looking in a mirror depresses me these days.

But given time we can change. \n\nI mean hell now with my realization that I need to improve myself for myself rather than others, I realize that my self esteem is effectively atrophied. So even if I have to remind myself 20,000 times a day, each time is worth it because it helps ingrain that into my mentality. Your mental state is most likely similar because you described verbatim how I feel. \n\nYou don’t have to be neutral, you don’t have to be lovey dovey. You just have to keep an open mind. Basically if you find yourself spiraling, then you should be able to eventually see that. If you can see that, then attempt to break that mental state via grounding yourself in some way. So what I do when I find myself spiraling thinking about how somebody might feel about me, is basically take a deep breath and tell myself a fact: I don’t know how anybody feels about me, and it doesn’t matter because how I feel about myself is more important. Therefore, how I feel somebody might feel about me is just causing me needless stress, so I make an effort to push past the thought. \n\nJust know that improvement will be taking thousands of attempts until it becomes second nature.

Me 10-12 years ago, you could have taken the words right out of my mouth.\n\n&gt;currently on the maximum legal dose of Vyvanse and feel like it does literally nothing.\n\nCan you keep doing something once you force yourself to do it for 2-3 minutes? I only realised that this is what it means for me when the drug is working a few years into taking it. If I haven't taken it, I'll not be able to keep my attention on something, of course, because that's what ADHD is. If I have taken it, I will be able to, but the coping mechanism telling me that it's better not to try something that I developed over 30 years of failing continuously is still there, and I have to fight through that to get to the point where the drug can help me. Sure it sucks right at the start, and if I don't actually start that feeling of dread that I have before starting something, the dread that tells me not to start it, will not go away. I have to force myself to start it, and once I do everything is fine.\n\nAs for the rest of what you said about how you feel:\n\n\"It will dispirit or feed you.\" Right now it's depressing. At some point you'll realise that with the backdrop of an oppressive economic system, society tailors itself to fit the average person in the best cases and so the full picture doesn't really look all that friendly or conducive to life for anyone who isn't an average person (who doesn't also fill the role of \"oppressor\"). What I'm trying to say is that your current position isn't your fault. It looks like you may already understand this to some extent, when you refer to a group you've joined as \"undesirable\".\n\nYou're wrong if you accept that label yourself - you are good enough for me and we should be enough for anyone. You're right if you understand that the label exists despite your own rejection of it. There are hateful bigoted jerks out there that will insist on certain types of people being rejected, or that it's a person's own fault for their rejection. Look up [the paradox of tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance), because according to it, these are the only types of people that actually should be rejected. The only thing you need to \"belong\" is a reasonable level of consideration for others. Your value is not in how much money you can make someone else, you have value *simply because you exist*. That you've been made to feel that you don't is a societal problem that you may be able to help solve, but it is not a problem that was created or is perpetuated by you. The only way it can become a problem that is perpetuated by you is if you accept it and internalise it.

I still have one foot in that place as we speak if I'm honest, I keep having to wrestle with the impulse to just give up again.\n\nI was recently diagnosed at 44 and almost lost everything in the run up to that diagnosis. I was \"failing\" over and over again and had no explanation for it. The less caring people in my life were extremely critical (the usual accusations of laziness and not caring enough, etc., etc.) and in the absence of a logical answer I bought into that criticism. I believed everything people were saying because I had no counterpoint. Now I finally understand the reason I've struggled so much and that it was beyond my control at the time I've finally been able to forgive myself for what's been and gone.\n\nWhat's helped me since then is to focus on what I *have* done, the progress I *have* made despite my disability. We were born into a world that is structured around people with normal, functional brains and the expectations of society are that we should conform to that standard. We can't, at least not without support and a lot of effort that normal people don't need to make. The fact we've been able to navigate life (even if we've done so \"badly\" by normal standards) is a huge achievement.\n\nMy advice would be to throw away all the \"rules\" you've internalised that have been set by people who don't have your disadvantages. Create your own set of rules and standards for yourself and what you'd like from life. Aim for something realistic and take small steps to get there. Be kind with yourself if you fall back and remember you've started over before, you can do it again.

You’re probably really funny (lot of us with ADHD are). \n\nI think anything you can do to stop/distract from the rumination you should do. Do something creative, do something physical, read a book from the library, literally anything to disrupt the spiral. Noticing when you have a negative thought and trying to replace it with a neutral (or eventually positive one) can be really helpful in my experience. I used to always have thoughts like “I hate myself” so I started by just noticing it and then I started catching it and replacing it “I’m doing my best” or “I’m trying” and eventually that progressed to be more and more positive.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "I will try to provide a nuanced perspective. \n\nI’ve had similar experiences where I suspect I would jump in before someone was done because I really needed to say what was on my mind before I forgot it. The deficits in working memory were the drivers. After noticing, I take notes either physical or on my phone and let them know I’m not scrolling social media. The notes are key points and phrases of what they said and what I want to say so I don’t forget and can refer back to. \n\nYou say “people always” so I’m not sure if hyperbole. If you walk around and everywhere smells like shit, are you sure you didn’t step in dog shit?\n\nNow, a conversation is a dialogue not a monologue. This has so many implications. If they’re droning on and on, that’s a lecture not a conversation. If they’re doing it in a way that’s not approachable for you to understand, that’s a bad lecture. \n\nI’ve noticed a good rule of thumb is one person speaking for about 60-90seconds but obviously more or less is fine depending on circumstances. Does the person provide a clear signal that signifies they are done talking?\n\nHowever, a big part of communication is actually listening not necessarily speaking. I like the quote that’s like there’s a reason why we have “two ears and one mouth”. We should be listening more than we talk to really understand what the person is saying and picking up subtle gestures and meanings that might not be said explicitly. It’s difficult for sure but is fundamental to a good conversation. If both parties don’t do this, it’ll be a bad conversation. \n\nA great conversation is like a ping pong match with a long rally. it also may not be your tribe. If they objectively talk for so long and they’ve noted you interject. Is it fair to note to them what is happening to you? \n\nExamples:\n“It is difficult for me to maintain attention because you speak for 5 mins at a time and thats quite long for me. Can you open with a TLDR summary before going into it?” bro even typical people don’t have an attention span for that.  \n\n“I feel it is difficult to share my thoughts because there isnt a clear end based on your tone and inflection. Can you help me understand when you’re done?”\n\n“Do you just want me to listen?” Some times people want help problem solving. But my partner has helped me see that sometimes they just want to feel like we’re heard without trying to think critically and solving a problem.”\n\nYou can be part of a conversation without speaking a lot. Unless it’s objectively true, I recommend against using hyperbole such as “no one ever…”, “they always…”. One of the things that is discussed in CBT. Also it’s essentially a form of “gaslighting” if you really think about it.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767958160.0, "id": "nyku877", "author": "drunkalcoholic"}

And did you ever get to a point of being able to use them? What got you there? Or have you resigned to manage your ADHD without meds?\n\nI was first diagnosed 2 years ago but I have very complex PTSD and have not had any luck being able to stabilise the PTSD before starting ADHD meds which has meant on 2 occasions I’ve ended up in a bad way of extreme stress and ptsd symptoms on both stimulant and non stimulant ADHD meds involving hospital admission. I’m on this journey once again now with trying to stabilise and am making progress, but the psychiatrist is very cautious about ADHD meds and I suspect they may never come.\n\nHospitals are seeing a lot of people start stimulant meds for ADHD after brief assessments and ending up in a bad way (unstable, manic, psychotic) I appear to be in this category of people who destabilise badly. I don’t see it talked about much on forums though, the dark side of ADHD meds.

I got to a point a couple times where I couldn’t keep food down bc I was so hungry and had to go to urgent care. I feel like being hungry while on stimulants feels worse than being hungry off of them, it exacerbates the negative physical symptoms because your body is in overdrive. Keep in mind too that stimulants speed your metabolism up, so you need even more food than normal.\n\nReally work on eating 3 meals a day, as hard as it may sound. I had to really work at it and finally my appetite is pretty much fully back and is only really suppressed for the peak of my medication. Once you get into the habit of eating enough and regularly again, you will seriously feel so much better and your meds will work so much better too. \n\nGet calories in any way you can at first when it’s really hard, through easy stuff like smoothies, soup, PBJ sandwiches, yogurt, bananas, string cheese, quesadillas, chocolate milk, etc. Eventually your body will start signaling for you to eat once it sees that you are going to feed it and your appetite will wake back up. For a long time my only sign of being hungry was that I felt awful and was having acid reflux. It literally took me almost a year to finally stay on top of eating consistently partly due to financial reasons but now that I’m on top of it I feel like I can take on so much more. Utilize tasty take out if nothing sounds good to you, that’s what I do when I have bad decision fatigue from hunger and the food usually looks and smells so good that I’m able to eat it even when I’m struggling with appetite.\n\nEdit: what might help is if you set a timer for yourself to eat something every 2-3 hours. Try a meal for breakfast, then a snack 2hr later, then a meal for lunch, then a snack 2hr later, then a meal for dinner, then a snack before bed. It sounds like a lot of eating when you don’t have an appetite, but your body needs that much fuel. I had zero idea what a normal portion or normal amount of food was for a while since I got so used to barely eating, but you need more than you think you do. ALSO!!! Drink lots and lots of water.

When someone gives you a list, write it down as they're talking, not after. During conversations: repeat things back or paraphrase. \"So just to make sure I got this: step one is X, step two is Y, then Z...\" This forces you to pay attention, gives them a chance to correct you, and you're creating a mental record. For longer instructions: use voice to text on your phone. Most phones can transcribe what someone is saying in real time. You can review the transcription right after the conversation. Try a structured note taking system: numbered lists, checkboxes, voice memos. When someone starts listing things, write down the first two immediately, then ask \"and what are the remaining steps?\" Break complex instructions into smaller chunks. If you're already on Vyvanse and still struggling with this, talk to your doctor about dosage adjustments or whether adding a non stimulant medication that targets working memory might help.

A lot of workplaces now allow recording meetings, trainings, or verbal instructions. That can be a game changer. You can replay it later when your brain is quieter and actually absorb the steps. If recording isn’t an option, asking for written follow-ups or permission to take notes during conversations is reasonable and common.\nAnother useful move is saying, “Let me repeat that back to make sure I’ve got it.” Saying it out loud helps lock it in, and it also gives the other person a chance to clarify or reorder the steps.\nBeing on medication doesn’t mean these challenges disappear. Focus and working memory aren’t the same thing. This is about how information is held, not motivation or effort. You’re already doing the right thing by noticing the pattern and planning to talk with your doctor.

It can be really tough to juggle multiple instructions, especially when it feels like information just slips away after a conversation.

You could try jotting down key points or using bullet lists to help you remember those steps. I also found that audio recording can be a game changer. These days, I just record everything with an app I built called [ParrotNotes.app](http://ParrotNotes.app) It works in the background event with the app locked. It really helps me focus on listening instead of frantically writing. It turns the audio into organized notes, catching action items and key details that I might miss during the discussion.\n\nIn addition to that, it could be helpful to repeat back what you’ve heard or ask for clarification during the conversation. This not only reinforces what you need to remember but also gives you a chance to check if you got everything right. It’s all about finding strategies that work for you.

As someone who's been on ADHD meds for the last 11 or so years, I am right there with you with how frustrating it is when they don't work as they should.\n\nSounds like what you're describing is the classic ADHD plateau that I'm sure we've all frequently found ourselves in many times over. The good news is this won't last forever, no matter what you do. Eventually our brains get so agitated by monotony they throw us out of it. However, if you are looking for a potential method for getting out of the rut sooner, one I adopted during lockdown was this: suddenly change your routine. It can be anything, just as long as it's sudden enough and significant enough to spark up some new (or old!) pathways in your brain. For me, I do this by changing my sleep schedule to be the opposite of what it is now. Sounds dramatic I know but it works! By swapping to a nocturnal schedule during lockdown I was able to study for over a 100 days straight, and it clearly paid off because it's what got me into Oxford. However, it doesn't have to be this specifically, just whatever changes up your day to day routine enough to shock your ADHD brain into action. I just find the sleep schedule thing easiest to adopt as it's low energy. It does help to have a goal in mind while doing this though.\n\nKeep your head up, you're not alone!!", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767980122.0, "id": "nyms4qe", "author": "xXJublettXx"}

I’m left paralyzed when trying to act in some helpful way because I’m terrified I will make another dumb decision, and that my wife will finally decide she has had enough. I’ve been lucky enough to be married to someone who has incredible patience people wit ADHD. When we found out I had ADHD, it increased her patience for many of my behaviors. However, I am worried that her patience is running out and that, at the best, she has permanently lost tremendous respect for me and will just think of me as another liability alongside her kids. At the worst, I might make a decision that turns out so bad she might leave me.\n\nI just needed to vent this somewhere.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "I am really sorry this is happening to you. I also find my ability to manage my symptoms to be inversely proportional to how difficult my life is. Having a sick parent and having to deal with all the logistics, it is so emotionally, mentally, and physically draining, plus you have to work? And maintain your marriage? And take care of yourself? And your house? And your kids? And did you know all of you have to eat like three times a day? And bathe sometimes and like, clip your nails and shit?? Like that’s so much stuff!! \n\n\nAll of this is so much to deal with for anyone; it’s not just you, it’s not because you are a failure or less than anyone else. Your ability to manage has shrunk, and that is OK and typical of most people. It is 100% ok and even preferable for you to reach out for help. While you are handling this enormous task of caring for a parent and their affairs, you will have a clearer mind if you can figure out how to let go of or delegate some of your responsibilities,  and ask for help from others, or use the shit out of your support or self-management systems. \n\n\nLike just as an example, if you cannot remember by yourself to go pick up your kids on time, it is OK to ask someone you trust to do this for you every so often, when you feel overwhelmed. Or if you’re the only one who can pick up your kids, then it’s ok to ask someone else to make sure the laundry gets done or whatever else is weighing on your mind. It is not a crime to Instacart your food and only buy things you can pop in the microwave. \n\n\nNobody can fully rely on their memory, and I especially cannot rely on just my brain when I’m going through a hard time, even for extremely simple tasks. One time I tried to pour a hot, empty kettle onto the counter because I forgot to put water in the kettle, find a mug, and get a tea bag. Seriously. I need to use every resource available to me so I can function like a somewhat normal person. It is ok to write things down, put things in super obvious places, not do the laundry for a few days, ask a friend to come and help you clean the house, ask a friend to watch your kids while you work on something else, eat a cookie instead of making lunch (not recommended but sometimes you can’t come up with the energy to get out a pan), or just ask someone to help you manage your life while you take some time for yourself. \n\n\nWhen my parents were both sick and I had to manage, this is going to sound silly, but the things that helped me the most were things that helped me manage my anxiety and let me think more clearly: \n1. Someone helped me park my car in a really crowded area so I didn’t have to deal with the stress of finding a parking spot; and \n2. My friend visited me for three days and went with me to handle my parents’ affairs. It was such a relief having a second person who could help me do the hard work of thinking and remembering, so I could feel less anxious about my own shortcomings coming to bite me in the ass later. \n3. My work told me to just go handle my affairs and not worry about them whenever I needed, an hour here, a half day there, a couple of days there, as long as I told them in as much advance as possible and prepped a little so I didn’t screw anyone over. I still worked when I could, but when I felt overwhelmed, I told them I needed to go handle something, that X task was done, I’d handle Y when I get back, and I’ve shown Z person how to handle the time-sensitive thing that needs to be done. \n\n\n\nTell your wife how you’re struggling and what you need and tell her you’re sorry, and ask her to collaborate with you and figure out how to avoid this situation for next time. We all do stupid stuff we wish we didn’t do, and when life gets hard, it gets very easy to mess up. That is totally ok. Think about how to avoid it for next time, give yourself compassion rather than shame, and ask for help, because you’re going through a lot. ", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1767936698.0, "id": "nyjokiz", "author": "Notdavidblaine"}

Personally, I realized it’s all the time for me, before smart phones were even invented. It’s like I’m an oven and people without inattentive ADHD are light switches, because when I’ve warmed up enough to get in a flow of doing something, I can’t just turn myself off and the onto something else like a flipping a light switch. I remember being in elementary school and not wanting to leave at the end of the day, because I was in school mode, not walking home mode. I am one of the last people to leave social gatherings bc I’m in social mode. As an adult, I’m also the last person to leave work because I’m still in work mode. So, when I’m sitting in the car after driving somewhere, it makes sense I’m in sitting mode and I want to keep sitting. \n\n3) The best tip I’ve read is to say out loud, “3,2,1, GO!” I have to say it out loud to get out of my head and into the present moment.

I just need to get out of the car, and I can walk around and open the passenger side door to get my bag and any other stuff on the front seat.\n\n4) Try not to fit too much stuff into a day.

The IR is taken maybe 1/2 or so of days over all depending on the day and how I'm handing my focus.\n\nWhen I'm on vacation I will often go from daily dosing to maybe once or twice throughout the whole week or two. No withdraw issues, no tapering.\n\nNow, before I was in this routine, I had 2 25mg ER a day, which was WAY too much and did cause issues, so I had my doc lower the second, then had him change to even lower and IR.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767932682.0, "id": "nyjeccw", "author": "3720-to-1"}

My sister (who also has ADHD) just called the pantry the “food garage” because she’s tired and that’s what her mind served up. We’re cracking up. I know there have been a lot of makeshift names that come out of my mind and can’t recall the correct name, especially when I’m tired. Some of them just make me laugh and feel like their own kind of genius. “Food garage” is on that list in my opinion. Do any of you have terms you have accidentally called something that make you laugh or that stuck? \n\nExample: My sister accidentally called the pantry the “food garage”\n\nExample: As a child, I couldn’t remember the name of a cow lick (when a section of your hair sticks up) so I called it a frou-frou and it stuck. My whole family, including me, got such a laugh out of it that we still call it that.

Stimulants also just have the highest success rate by far, anything else you're tossing a coin\n\nThat besides, about 1/3rd of kids taking stimulants before adulthood grow to have a more healthy developed brain, as compared to the underdeveloped regions present in untreated ADHD. You'll never know if your kid individually has gotten this benefit, but it's a nice little bonus to be optimistic about.\n\nEdit: also let me say, the supposed negative long term consequences you've listing are bullshit. There are no permanent effects on mood disorders. You have it backwards actually, ADHD causes many mood disorders if you leave it untreated. Not a single one in your list is proven in the research. If you have bad side effects on the meds, you come off and the effects stop. Long term the only proven ill effect is a slight rise in blood pressure, which your doctor will monitor closely and work to mitigate. A slightly lower height in children has been documented, but is shown to normalize as long as the child is eating properly. When it's a concern the child can be given periods without meds to catch up.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767920696.0, "id": "nyidurb", "author": "JunahCg"}

These things are multi-factor issues. Imagine two ADHD kids the same age, one of them an only child born to affluent, caring parents: they get all the care and support they need. \n\nThe other child is 1 of 5 siblings, family living paycheck to paycheck, parents constantly overwhelmed, always yelling, everyone is constantly fighting at home, basic needs are not being met, conflicts are not resolved, and the ADHD child is constantly blamed for everything, since it seems to be making a tough situation even harder on the parents, and the ADHD child is being regularly scape-goated and punished.\n\nDo you think both those kids, if assessed, would have the same \"30% development lag?\". I don't think so. And for the second one, would it be appropriate to ascribe the lagging development only to ADHD, or should childhood trauma and neglect be factored separately? \n\nWith that said, ADHD is/can be a serious disability. It is well worth the time to research and assess exactly how and where it has been impacting your life, and developing mitigation strategies, finding the right type of work/life environment, medication etc. - even small improvements can compound over time to make a notable difference.", "score": 291, "created_utc": 1767909669.0, "id": "nyhcttt", "author": "Kulty"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "\"Maturity\" is a tern made up for the benefit of those who hold the power in our society. Because of our economic mode of production, a certain collection of traits is considered the ideal archetypal person. You probably know those traits: get up early; question only enough to do your job; disassociate from the boring parts and lock in at the important parts; internally justify or ignore immoral activity; be nominally self-enriching and don't worry about the damage you cause; only look for improvement when it comes at a monetary benefit. That sort of stuff. You're considered \"mature\", \"successul\" or \"adult\" if you present those behaviors. It's not a fundamental part of anyone's being, it's a measure of whether you have the priorities that are valued in the mode of production.\n\n\nADHD is a label for a class of behaviors that make a person decidedly not that. Those traits aren't there for no reason, evolutionarily it's just good to have people around who stay up late, go against the curve, question everything, etc. It's just that we've structured a society that punishes those traits unless - and this is why some people try to sell it as a \"gift\" - they can be exploited. If you can be exploited for your unique view of the world, THEN you can move up from a mere drain on society to a real Producer™️.\n\n\nADHD is a solid classification, because we've studied brain patterns and found that, yes, people diagnosed with ADHD have a wildly different pattern than people without. I don't want to make it sound like I don't believe it's a thing. I just think that 50% of the problems with ADHD are societal and 40% are biological.

I currently don't have a job, but i'm studying for the LSAT, so i study for a few hours a day, but i get anxious that i should be applying for jobs, and when i apply for jobs, i get anxious that i should be studying for the lsat. I feel like i'm doing a million things at a time, but at the end of the day, i feel like i've done nothing. I think it also doesn't help when i do stuff on my own time and i'm the one dictating deadlines and schedules. like when i was working a job, i felt like the normal dread of not wanting to be working at that moment lol, but i didn't feel that unsatisfied \"i don't feel like i've done anything today\" feeling. \n\nI don't know how helpful my advice would be because i def struggle with the same thing and i know all too well how anything that \"helps\" only helps for a little bit until it eventually stops working, but some things i think could help at least a little bit:\n\n\\- make some sort of plan or schedule, as loosely or as strict as you prefer. sometimes i like to be chill like \"hm maybe i'll go to the gym later after i socialize\" but sometimes, my brain kinda likes the stress of planning things down to the minute and turning it into a game or crossing stuff off a to-do list and getting the lil feeling of accomplishment. but i think in this particular situation, it helps to write down what you're doing and the time you plan to spend on it (even if you don't necessarily stick to that plan) i think it just helps to see it. so like i'd write down gym (1 hr) then socialize (3 hrs). that way, i could visually see that i have time for the things i want to do and realize i probably could fit it all in my schedule somehow? or if you can't reasonably fit it into your schedule, then you can see it visually and stop trying to think about the other thing you need to do.\n\n\\- i think multitasking may also help like if you bring a friend to the gym so you kinda get the best of both worlds at the same time. \n\n\\- taking the decision out of it also kinda helps. like i feel like there are too many possibilities of what i \"should\" be doing in the moment during my free time. tbh i feel like if you literally just put your options into a randomizer and like spin a wheel and let it choose for you what to do, then it takes the work of making the decision out of your hands. like when i have a necessary task like say putting gas in my car when i only have a few miles left in the tank, i know in my head that it's something that MUST be done. and so i don't question whether or not i should do it or what else i could be doing instead you know?\n\n\\- sometimes i also use like a \"schedule template\" if i have a free/unplanned day and i block out the day by certain intervals depending on what i need to get done that day. so say i need to study, apply to jobs, go to the gym, get groceries, and meal prep. i would block out the day in 5 different 1-2 hour intervals and i tell myself that at the end of the interval, i MUST change tasks. but i don't plan out which task goes into which interval until the hour ends. so that way it doesn't feel tooo plan-y, but there's still some sort of loose plan and timing for everything. and i would keep those intervals as some sort of \"template\" for whatever works for you like a whiteboard or a spreadsheet or a google calendar so the intervals are already mapped out so its less work for next time you gotta schedule stuff.\n\n\\- try to reach flow state so you are fully immersed in what you're doing. maybe notice the things you do that naturally trigger a flow state and see what you can do to purposely trigger it when you want to be more present in activity. like for me, im really into music and usually if i'm listening to music, i'm too preoccupied thinking about the lyrics and doing whatever activity i'm already doing, that i can't really think about too much else.\n\n  \nbut yea in general, for me when this happens i think it's like some sort of decision paralysis (even after the decisions technically been made and i'm already at the gym/studying/whatever) so anything you can do to actually feel like the decision has already been made or that the decision is out of your hands would help? and also just generally reminding yourself that you're doing something productive or fun or good for your health, so either option isn't bad. anyway hope this helppsssss :)", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767931200.0, "id": "nyja6g1", "author": "More_Broccoli3442"}

I was diagnosed almost a year ago (type A, I manage hyperactivity well enough), but treatment has taken a long time. It took about 8 months just to speak with a psychiatrist.\n\n* At the same time, my family has started seeing me as if I were “crazy”. Today I went to the hospital with my mom (where ADHD appointments are scheduled in my country, Italy). I chose to leave her outside the psychiatrist’s office because last time she tried to explain my behavior herself, minimizing everything (“everyone gets distracted sometimes”). Luckily, being 21, I can legally decide that and no one can go against it.\n* When we got home, I was met with silence and detachment. They’ve never really been supportive, but this time I felt clear disappointment. I had to explain again why I haven’t been prescribed medication yet: I still need blood tests, an ECG, and other exams before starting methylphenidate.\n\nTheir reaction was that they didn’t expect the medication to be “this serious”, that it will fry my brain, and that I’ll end up like \\[distant family member with completely different and severe mental conditions\\] because, according to them, he has “the same things ***I say*** I have”. This made it clear they see me as a crazy person to stay away from.\n\nNow, it’s clear they never really believed I have ADHD, and that I could just “try harder” and be fine.\n\nThe psychiatrist also recommended psychotherapy. My brother’s girlfriend suggested the same weeks ago for anxiety and stress issues that recently even led me to the ER. I’ll consider it once I start methylphenidate, and if I can afford it, but she's of the same idea.\n\nI’d basically be on my own in this, if it weren’t for my girlfriend.", "score": 28, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1767906281.0, "id": "1q7nz3t", "author": "Smoothie_3D", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1q7nz3t/my_whole_family_thinks_i_am_a_psycho_and/"}

We all naturally want our family and others close to us to be involved and support us, but the sad thing is, they are their own persons and will have their own biases and opinions, some so strongly they will go against all the facts and reasoning. Especially so for family...it's like they treat facts and your experience even more loosely. They often dont *want* their minds change, even if you're right. It hurts, a lot, but it's not your job at a certain point to educate people who dont want to be educated, and hear you out.\n\n\nBut that doesnt mean you have to cut everyone out of your ADHD journey, and you're far from alone! Your doctors seem very keen on helping you get through this well, and you said you also have your girlfriend. You can find more friends and advice here and many places that will give support! I always tell others you dont want to go at this alone, it's great to share and ask for help so you dont feel aimless.\n\n\nBeing cut out of emotional support from family, when you grew up with them and felt would always support you, is very harsh and might take a while to process...myself and many others I know have had to go through this. We learned to just be vague about stuff, or nod and change the subject. It's possible they'll come around in the future, but right now your healthcare is where your energy should go towards.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "My friend says I was \"chill\" before I started my meds. But I have never in my life been \"chill,\" except for the first three weeks or so I was properly medicated. I've always been wound really tight and prone to emotional outbursts. For a long time, the only thing keeping my energy and anxiety in check was major depressive disorder. If anything, these days I'm able to actually attain something approaching calmness, and I'm able to do it without needing to be in a hot shower.\n\nBut something curious happened when I started my ADHD meds: I realized that, to one degree or another, I hated just about everyone in my life. Once my brain was working above minimum capacity, I started noticing behavioral patterns I couldn't see before. I started asking myself \"Why am I putting up with this?\" \"Why am I doing this for people when I'm getting back far less than what I put in?\" \"Why did I sacrifice my life and my health for these people?\" \"Why am I sparing their feelings when they forget I exist when I leave the room?\" \"Why am I bothering trying to help them when they don't listen to a word I say?\" \"Why am I trying so hard to change for them when they won't change for themselves?\" I started distancing myself from my family and most of my friends, and even ended one of my longest friendships because our dynamic was... well, let's just say *really* unhealthy.\n\nThat isn't to say I'm hostile or anything; I don't go out of my way to cause trouble or to hurt people's feelings. I just don't feel like I need to devote my limited brainpower to entertaining their bullshit anymore, so I'm blunt and distant and liable to brush them off. I'm not apathetic either; I still care, I just realized I don't have the energy to keep pushing the boulder uphill when I know it's going to roll back down.\n\nBut, on the other hand, I also started appreciating the people I *don't* hate more. I realized that I'd been taking them for granted, and that they deserved better from me. The aforementioned friend who said I used to be \"chill\" is one of those people.", "score": 23, "created_utc": 1767909424.0, "id": "nyhbv4m", "author": "ArelMCII"}

You mention messiness, shutting down, not being motivated. From her perspective you *\"sending her a few things to help her understand\"* might be, once again, asking her to do the brunt of the work, in which case it makes sense she opposes it and sees you as making excuses rather than putting the work yourself.\n\nSince you ask for advice I have some. I focus on things YOU can do because regardless of where the blame lies, the best chances we have at changing people is changing ourselves. If you have trouble understanding her \"it's like living with a child\" I recommend You Should've Asked comic. [https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/) Think hard on how would you feel if the roles were reversed, find empathy and approach this whole thing from the angle of what you can do to improve the situation.\n\nAnd ultimately for the *hurtee* it matters little why the *hurter* did what they did. It still hurts and they need to live with that. \n\nSorry, without any specifics that's the best I can do :).

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Congratulations. I’m genuinely happy for you. I wrote a lot of stuff but I’m pretty sure it’ll be worth your while.\n\nI too struggled tremendously in high school. I want to tell you there is hope and a good probability you’ll end up just fine. \n\nAfter failing to find my purpose several years after high school, I struggled through an associate degree earned at a community college. I still didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up so I joined the Army. I learned a skill, long haul communications, and due to the rapid-fire pace of work I didn’t overthink things, i just sort of “succeeded “. My post-Army career wasn’t all peaches and cream but I had more success more time then not but not at every job. A lot depended on whether or not I had a good manager, again, the piece of the work. The second year out of the army I started a bachelors degree program in business management, taking classes at night. I think I succeeded at that because it wasn’t a typical curriculum or class structure, it was one four hour class per week and all the courses work I did at night or weekends. It just worked for me.\n\nI was a government contractor my whole career, mostly supporting the CIA, NRO, DIA and NGA as an engineer in cyber security for many years and other roles as well. I was an always a team lead or program manager and always had a team of engineers working fire me, many with masters or PHD degrees. \n\nI didn’t get diagnosed until I retired. It made my life-long struggles make sense. I was finally able to grant myself some grace; I wasn’t lazy, I wasn’t procrastinating, my executive function didn’t work right, you certainly have the same type of struggles.\n\nOnce you decide on a path forward whether that’s going to college, pursuing a job in the trades out or take a couple of years to figure it all out. I highly recommend you start seeing a therapist that is knowledgeable about ADHD, it has helped me tremendously. \n\nBTW, more words. My nephew, who dropped out of school in his freshman year started working for a plumbing company in his mid 30s, is now a journeyman plumber at 40 and making great money. Don’t judge yourself by others, your journey is unique to you. As I always told my daughters, it doesn’t matter where you start from, it only matters where you finish. This was truly relevant to me and my younger daughter who took 5 1/2 years to complete her college degree after a disastrous first year and a half. She changed her major, moved home, and commuted to class after her older sister blasted through a biochemistry degree in four years. She’s now the sole Sharepoint developer (kind of a Microsoft web designer) for her entire company.\n\nBest of luck in all things. Enjoy the last and best semester of high school, since you’re graduating, and have a great summer.", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1767910137.0, "id": "nyhelom", "author": "HardestButt0n"}

In preparing for admissions, I didn't even take the CLEP test because, to be honest, I didn't think I was smart enough to CLEP out of any classes.\n\nA weird thing happened after I got to college. Because I took classes that were interesting to me or I found challenging (i.e., that I found stimulating), I actually did well in them. In fact, there were a considerable number of tests where I not only received an A, but on quite a few tests, I received the highest score in the class., I'm also a member of a collegiate honors society.\n\nIncidentally, I was not diagnosed with AD/HD until I was 36 years of age, so I went through the entirety of my university studies undiagnosed and unmedicated. I'm sure medication would have given me an edge, but as it was, I guess I really didn't need it.\n\nTherefore, I would encourage you to further your education.

I am currently on Vyvanse with an Adderall booster in the afternoon. Its been working well and I genuinely need it for work, without it, I wouldn’t be able to focus or show up the way my job requires. But lately, I’m starting to feel really conflicted about the side effects.\n\nI’ve always struggled with appetite and rough comedowns. I do my best to take measures to avoid this but often times in these crashes I feel awful, irritable, and sometimes pretty snappy or mean, even though that’s not how I want to be. Since I’m at work all day, the main time my partner sees me is around 6pm, which unfortunately seems to be peak crash time, so he’s often seeing me at my worst.\n\nTo me, this has always felt “normal” because it’s been the same with every stimulant I’ve tried, but to him it isn’t, and I totally get why it worries him. He doesn’t understand why I would put myself through the side effects just to be productive at work. I’m also not on some huge or extreme dose, this just seems to be how my body reacts.\n\nI’m mostly wondering if this is just part of the deal long term. Can anyone relate?

I'm not at a period in my life where it's comfortable for me to try out different medications since I'm in college for chemistry and if my medication isn't effective enough, I will most certainly fail all my classes lol.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Don't go in with expectations.  For something like 25% of people with ADHD the first medication they try either has so many side effects they have to stop, or it doesn't work.  For a much higher percentage they start with side effects which make the medication more unpleasant than helpful, but the side effects resolve after a week or so of dosing.  There is a very wide range of side effects these medications have, and there's no way to preemptively know which of the side effects you will have, and which you will not have, or if you will have none at all.  It is very normal to have to try a few different medications over many months before you find one which works well for you.\n\nAll this to say your early experiences can vary wildly, so don't assume the medication isn't working because it doesn't feel good right away.\n\nI didn't at all have a \"finally my brain is quiet\" moment, or early feelings of euphoria (which is a short term effect and is not supposed to be the every day experience of ADHD meds).  What I do have is a consistent period of time after I take my dose, every day, where I can get shit done without mental pain and resistance.  My memory has not gotten better, but I'm better about consistently writing down stuff I need to know when medicated.  Honestly, other than being unable to nap during the day, and less snack cravings, while dosed, my meds don't \"feel\" different from not being medicated.  If I didn't try to get work done I don't think I'd notice any difference.  But I do get work done, and I can tell that THAT is easier.\n\nGenerally you will start with a pretty low dose of meds and \"titrate up\".  For me I would get used to each dose and start to feel like it wasn't working well any more after week 2 of taking.

Me and my wife have three kids(14, 11, and 7). Teenagers, am I right? They just tune us out, say we're always nagging. Family life's basically a mess! On top of that, my wife's been diagnosed with ADHD (she's getting treatment, though).  \nThe toughest part is seeing her want to pitch in, but the ADHD kinda turns her efforts invisible. Like last night, she said she'd help our oldest with homework. Five minutes later, she hears the sink running and heads to do dishes, then spots some mail on the counter she needs to answer, grabs her phone… Next thing I know, I've finished reading the little one a bedtime story, the homework's only half-checked, the sink's still full, and she's scrolling on her phone surrounded by clutter, totally lost track of time. So guess who ends up doing all three things over? Honestly, it's more draining than if she didn't help at all.  \nWe've talked about it a bunch, tried reminders and to-do lists, nothing's stuck. So I really need some real-life tips from anyone living with an ADHD partner and a houseful of kids. Any gentle ways to handle that after-work meltdown without making her or the kids feel blamed?  \nOh, and how do y’all manage to teach your kids without things blowing up?  \nI'm wondering if more visual tools might help, like putting up a daily routine chart somewhere obvious.

Simple things like thanking each other for doing X often go a long way; everyone likes to see their efforts acknowledged.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "So, what finally has worked for me in keeping house and keeping up with people: I had to design my life around my adhd rather than trying to fit the ways of others. Basically, by creating an ADHD friendly life I was able to drastically improve my life. For example, I keep hampers in every room so that I don't have to go out of my way to pick up clothes. I keep a basket on top of both my washer and dryer so that once they're full I will mindlessly throw things in the wash or put things away because the effort is that much lower. I keep my toothbrush in the kitchen because I'm more likely to remember to brush my teeth before eating breakfast instead of after if I see my toothbrush while setting my kettle for tea. \n\nHabit stacking has also been very successful for me. Rather than trying to eliminate my bad habits (unrealistic), I pair them with better ones (sustainable). For example, I like to get on my phone but my commitment is the first app I open is my ebook app (Libby) instead of socials. However, I also only commit to this before noon because I'm aware that too much constraint frustrates me. \n\nThe last thing that worked for me was identifying when my symptoms were the least... Severe. And doing my work primarily in those times. Like I'm great from 4am-10am, absolutely a mess between 10-3pm, good from 4-7pm, and basically useless after that. You might notice the same with your partner or ask her to observe her own feelings and behaviors so that you all can develop an ADHD friendly life together. \n\nIt's also worth noting that organizing your house with ADHD in mind may end up benefiting your kids long term, as we often see parents with adhd have at least one child with ADHD as well.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767894878.0, "id": "nyfsges", "author": "Cynyoubeengone"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Oh, I missed your second question, but as a former adhd teen two things worked well for me: chore chart on the fridge and a structure to who cleaned what. \n\nWhen we were about 8, my parents assigned my brothers and I an area of the house to be responsible for on a weekly cycle. Kitchen, bathroom, living room, on rotation. If I recall correctly, they also started by teaching us specifically how those rooms needed to be cleaned. For example, the kitchen counter needed to be cleaned at night, the dishes needed to be washed at night or before my parents got up, and the floor shouldn't be a mess. By the end of your week in the kitchen, you needed to mop. Honestly, this was nice because A) there were clear expectations and B) you didn't have to be in charge of the hardest chores all the time. Just every 3 weeks (kitchen was by far the most labor intensive). In week 4, we'd do a deep clean together where everyone is cleaning in the morning, music is playing, and we'd end by noon (no matter how much was cleaned) with a big breakfast. It was great tbh and I keep that tradition for myself in adulthood. \n\nThe chore chart I didn't have until I had roommates, but we basically did the same rotation as when I was a kid + a few other odd jobs. It was right there on the fridge, so it was easy to see if I'd fallen behind and communal shame made me get it together lol.\n\nEdit to add one more thing: This was something I figured out later, but I also am better able to accomplish things when I'm given clear time expectations/boundaries + the reasoning behind those boundaries. For example, someone saying \"can you do the dishes\" is tougher for me than \"can you do the dishes by 5 because I need to do x in the kitchen at 7.\" My mom and I used to clash around chores because of situations where she would ask for things, but not actually communicate what she needed. We had a big fight once that played out like this: \n\n*Me, sitting and reading*\nHer: Can you do the dishes? \nMe: yes (and I make a note to do them when I finish my next chapter) \nHer: (comes back frustrated) I thought I asked you to do the dishes! \n\nWe proceed to go back and forth, until she finally mentions that we have company coming and so on. I'm sitting there like... Why did you not indicate that this was urgent. Anyway, if you all aren't in the norm of communicating about needs in addition to requests then I'd suggest doing so.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1767895485.0, "id": "nyfute2", "author": "Cynyoubeengone"}

It doesn't. We will always feel like we're failing at everything. But you have got to figure out what your priorities are, what tasks NEED to be done, and how to get them done. And what tasks you can let go of for a bit. \n\nIt's different for everyone. And it takes time to try different things and see what works and doesn't work.

But I also have a prescription for 10 Ritalin, with permission to take 1 or 2 at a time at my own discretion, to take on days I need to be functional in the evening hours after the Concerta wears off. I find this crucial for dealing with teenager evening meltdowns, days when the house is an especially bad wreck, etc. And I make rules and concessions for myself. For example, I recently got my first dishwasher, which was worth it a million times over, and I force myself to fill it every night. Boom! Dishes DONE!

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "Not sure if my experience provides useful data, but here's to hoping it does. I've tried three different types of medications, one of which my wife who suffers from combined type took for a single, unsuccessful, tortuous week.\n\nOne worked for a while but lost efficacy after roughly a year. That was adderall immediate release (IR) 15mg, taken twice daily, increased over that year from a paltry 5mg dose that barely did anything. I started falling asleep on the stuff because, for whatever reason, my body burned through each dose within two hours of taking it. Not ideal for running a college classroom, as you might imagine. \n\nI struggled through a short transition period to the one that still works two years later--adderall extended release (XR) 30mg (which I'll get to in a moment)--during which my wife had, herself, quickly abandoned her methylphenidate (ritalin) for adderall XR. With her permission, I irresponsibly tried some of her excess Ritalin to see if it would be a better option while I awaited approval for my XR 30mg prescription. I became anxious, unfocused, angry, and, worst of all, twitchy. But brain chemistry is weird. For some people, what my body reacted to poorly has the opposite effect on others. You might be one of those people.\n\nWhat worked best was Adderall XR. As an inattentive-type who was diagnosed nearly three years ago at 38, I learned to mask over an undiagnosed life by harnessing my anxieties similar to how you used yours in social situations. That masking behavior also got me through graduate school and some of my career that followed. The difference is that adderall XR, which I understand is similar to vyvance, mitigates the impulsive behaviors that used to get me in trouble (gallows humor jokes in mixed company, for instance) and allows me to make more careful decisions with a measure of confidence. \n\nAnyway, the final, conclusive point i want to make is this: there is a third big factor to consider when choosing a medication. The two I already covered are medication type and dosage. The third, least appreciated by those who don't understand the struggle (pharmacists and some doctors) is manufacturer of the medication, but this problem likely only applies if you're on a generic brand, which I am. Even for Adderall XR, if I get a month of, say, Elite Pharmaceuticals, I'm more often falling asleep than functioning. But if I get Actavis/Teva, Amneal, or (oddly because I've read so many hate it) Granules, I'm perfectly happy.\n\n\nAnyway, feel free to reach out if you want to discuss further. I'm always happy to help a fellow struggler, especially if they're about to weather the difficulties of graduate school, which is rewarding but tough for us. Medication may help with mitigating or altogether forestalling burnout, but that means first finding what works for you.\n\nHope this helped, at least a little!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767899657.0, "id": "nygb0a2", "author": "drbanality"}

My first day of taking adderall was the first and only time that my mind was blank (no background noise, singing, thoughts, etc), and I was more quiet and felt ‘drab’ and not like myself. I’ve never felt like that again. \n\nHow it affects me is- I can maintain a conversation and listen to a person and not forget what the conversation is about because I’m focused on the 2-3 trains of thought in my brain that the conversation started. I also don’t automatically speak without processing the thought first. I still have the normal thoughts, I just have fewer at a time. I do still forget to listen and have to replay the conversation as it’s happening to catch up, but I realize sooner that I stopped listening, so can catch up sooner.  Basically, it’s calmed my brain significantly, but it’s still the same brain, just doesn’t make me feel like a failure or a jerk for not paying attention. \n\nThe negative part of the medication for me is that it eases me into hyperfocus. I’m 37 and have been taking meds for 5 years, and my brain is still afraid to leave hyperfocus because I couldn’t go back to focusing before the meds. When I’m hyperfocused, I’m boring, but that’s always been the case. So, I think it’s my fear of losing focus that causes me to stay in hyperfocus, but the medication lets that happen. \n\nMedication affects everyone differently. For me, there’s a night and day difference in how I feel when I take it- but it doesn’t change my personality- just makes me a better friend/ employee/ partner because I don’t have to forget everything multiple times. It also makes my life 1000x easier and less stressful. \n\nVyvanse had a horrible effect on my hormones, and I don’t think it helped my adhd at all.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "It could be that you’re not on the right med or dose. It took me a couple years to dial in my meds after getting diagnosed (but I was fighting pmdd and depression too, so there were a couple meds). Adderall and vyvanse both work well for me, but I learned some people do much better with Ritalin vs adderall/vyvanse. I guess the way they work in the brain is totally different.\n\nBut I’m mostly here to talk about our good lord and savior, magnesium 😆Most people are already deficient in magnesium and it plays a huge role in a lot of things our bodies do (different forms do different things). I’ve read stimulants deplete magnesium faster, so it’s especially recommended to supplement then. One form I swear by is magnesium threonate. I take ~100 mg every morning. One friend (also on stimulants) tried it and she didn’t like how it made her feel. So, it’s trial and error with supplements too. You can have your vitamin/mineral levels tested, so that can be a place to start to determine whether you’re deficient in anything.\n\nAre stimulants impacting your sleep? That can make a huge impact on cognitive functioning. I started taking a small dose of trazadone at night to help and that’s made a huge difference as well. So maybe taking another med or supplement to help with sleep, or figuring out a new bedtime routine would be helpful? There are forms of magnesium that help with sleep, too. I also take a magnesium supplement at night that has malate, taurate, and glycinate. \n\nAre you getting enough protein/nutrients? I barely ate anything when I started stimulants and making myself drink meal replacement shakes periodically was helpful. Obviously real food is best, but if that’s not an option (and let’s be real with ourselves…..lol), anything to help your body do its thing is better than nothing. \n\nLastly, there’s this thing called skills regression that happens after diagnosis. Our mask drops and we have to kind of figure out who we are again. So it’s probably not “who you really are”. Make sure to give yourself grace and not overthink some things.

I've always believed that technology could be helpful for my distraction and procrastination. At the moment, I'm really enjoying a Mac app called Session, which is broadly aligned with the Pomodoro technique, but with a few little differences which I think are important. \n\nFirstly, it's really easy to extend a Pomodoro Focus or a break session, you just hit a five-minute-plus or even a five-minute-minus button. Secondly, you can also end a focus session or a break where you like. You are not fixed by boundaries. If you need to focus for 13 minutes or 23 minutes, that's fine. Thirdly, it records the duration of your sessions, I like to see how much focus time I've had. 4th, it blocks websites and apps during a focus session.   \n  \nI think the little bit of flexibility over Pomodoro tools is why I'm enjoying this so much. I don't feel I have to focus to the end of a twenty-minute period. I can stop it when a piece of work naturally ends or there is a natural break in a piece of work. I can also extend the break beyond five minutes without feeling like I've done something wrong.   \n\n\nAs we all know, this might be another false dawn, but it's been useful for a few months now. I just wonder if any of this resonates with other people here, or are there other tools which offer similar flexibility? \n\nI have no commercial relationship with the developer. In fact, I've got no idea who the developer is. \n\nCaveat: If my sleep is bad, nothing helps, not even this app.  ", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767878318.0, "id": "1q7bke0", "author": "enrvuk", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1q7bke0/another_false_dawn_or_has_this_app_hit_on/"}

Simple rule. If I didn't run yesterday I have to run today. No complicated schedules, no chains of conditions I could break. If I can't run today, I'll have to run tomorrow.\n5. Obvious progress and space to catch back up: I've gone from feeling like vomiting after 60 seconds to (mostly) steady breathing after a 5 min jog.

I don't want to clean up before I'm finished because that discourages me from starting anything. If I know I can leave my work in place to finish later, that removes some of the dread of cleaning up. Then it also feels inviting to return to it.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "ADHD", "text": "I also have a ton of hobbies and I’ve noticed over the years that the motivation to do them definitely comes in waves. I’ll get a period of intense hyperfocus, finish the thing and then not touch it for months or even years. Sometimes I have to re-learn it when I pick it up again.\n\nAnd that’s okay! \n\nFor me it kind of helps if there is a deadline or urgency to the task. Like, I knitted a Star Wars scarf for my ex boyfriend, and I gave it to him late, but I totally focused on that for hours on end to finish it. Also for Halloween last year I wanted to be a skeleton so obviously there was a deadline for that. I painted my pants (like the day before lol). When I got to the torso part I found it too difficult though, so I gave up trying to paint it and went as a half skeleton. Everyone loved that😆\n\nAnother idea is getting hobbies where focusing is a life or death situation (try this at your discretion🫠) I am into skiing and cycling, when you’re out there on the road or hill a second of carelessness could mean the end! So I am 100% locked in. It’s kind of relaxing. Also it scratches my hyperactive/risk seeking itch. I guess going to metal and punk concerts and moshing/headbanging is the same. \n\nSo my advice is until you can get back on meds, give yourself the grace to not be able to focus on hobbies(or just do them in little spurts!) \n\nFor context, I’m about a month on intuniv now, but I’m not finding it’s much help.

I have a sleep study scheduled to further investigate all of that.\n\nAnyway, I’ve been on 20mg Jornay PM for about two weeks now. The first week, sleep was pretty normal and I was waking up feeling refreshed. Week two, and I’m waking up constantly throughout the night, usually starting around three hours after initially falling asleep. Every time I need to turn over, I wake up. I’m falling back asleep fairly quickly each time, but it seems to be getting a bit worse each night. I still feel functional during the day, but I’m experiencing more headaches and memory issues. I’ve been on other formulations of methylphenidate before, and, while they caused some sleep disturbances, it was nothing like this.

RSD is a great example, because you used the word \"perceive\". I very often perceived things that my partner said as rejection or criticism, when they truly just tried to express their feelings.

Its basically like you said, but it works both ways.\n\nI would also not expect so much from people in general. You might underestimate just how little the general population is educated and aware about mental health disorders. Many people truly don't realize what that means, like at all. They think depression is something you can beat by \"just cheering up\", they think that concentration issues from ADHD are just something you \"push through\". Honestly, you can't even blame em for being so ignorant, because they are only projecting their own reality onto the world around them, its all they can do after all. They literally can't grasp it, because they lack education or intellect or both. Empathy is sadly more and more rare these days, our society doesn't encourage it either.\n\nI do acknowledge ADHD as a disability btw, medically speaking it is absolutely clear.

Things that can be done later\n\nWhat's weird is that for us, #2 is actually a subset of #1, because once you're attention is off of things, it's almost as if they never happened lol\n\nFor me, I have really bad emotional regulation and a lot of people with ADHD have this same problem, so when I experience something where I feel I should do it, I try to handle it IMMEDIATELY rather than try to do it later.  Those things go into category 1.\n\nFor everything else that can wait, I put into category 2 and try to externalize it IMMEDIATELY when it happens.  I write it down, set alarms on my phone, calendar notifications, etc.\n\nAs far as this weird need to be punished by others, I think that's something completely different and also not very effective for people with ADHD.  People with ADHD tend not to have executive functioning so what that means is there isn't like this gradient background experience or feeling of needing to do something.\n\nAs soon as you're attention isn't on that thing, your actual experience of it goes from 100% to 0% instantly.  It's binary.  So what we need to rely on is commitment and things we know that actually work for us.\n\nTry to think of it like this, you need to do a task, you just need to rely on what your system actually has to deal with it.\n\nYou have ADHD.  The brain isn't normal.  Positive or negative reinforcement does not work as well in a system where things turn into binary (on/off) switches instead of gradient background experiences.\n\nYou probably even realize this subconsciously because (at least for me) it feels wrong to take your attention off of something really important and you end up in like spiraling thought loops because you're resisting pulling your attention away from it, but that is okay to do.  It's necessary, we literally can't constantly be on top of things.  Our attention doesn't work that way.\n\nWhat has helped me more than anything else is internalizing the idea that failure is not something to be afraid of unless the consequences are unacceptable, but it is instead a mechanism for learning and improvement.\n\nI process fast, evaluate consequences first, act immediately, and deal with the consequences as they come.

You live in a time where things are much more difficult. I lived in a time where the internet was a place you went and things were so fragmented it was easy to be anyone and disappear just as quickly. Now you live in a world permeated with it and being on the technology side of the work, I am sorry.\n\nThat said, when people say \"tough it out it gets better\" they mean it. I don't want to minimize the strangeness of having ADHD growing up. Take solace in the fact we are perpetual late bloomers. We do get there. Just a little slower than most. I still look much younger than I actually am while so many people my age are starting to look like old care tires.\n\nEmbrace your strangeness. We are a little different. We aren't a broken thing to be fixed. We have a limitation to work around and limitations inspire creative solutions.\n\nDon't say this to folks since it will just get turned on you but do your best to understand most hate is self hate. I heard this repeated to me so much growing up and I couldn't fathom it while I was being relentlessly picked on for similar reasons how that could be true. The longer I live the longer my view grows and the more true it is. The fact is, everyone is scared and insecure in some capacity at your age. They're trying to suppress it to look strong and let me say, suppression NEVER works. Emotions unfelt will just seep out of you in uncontrolled, maladaptive ways.\n\nWe will always have to work harder than others in the society we built to keep up. Not by much, but it is a constant.

As I've found that the more consistent I am with things, the better things are and the easier it is to manage - but man it's a struggle in the beginning. I'd say start slow, pick one thing to focus and start there. Even if its every morning write down 3 tasks you need to do that day and then they are the priority, everything else you are able to do is a bonus. It's not a lot but it's a start. \n\nIt can also be helpful to try and breakdown the problem as well to try workshop a solution. So why is it you can't stick to structure? Is it the executive dysfunction of starting tasks, is it object permanence with a planner/schedule, is it the organisation and management of things?

So to avoid this bad experince, I would avoid planning altogether. This didn't help me be more organized or achieve more It only made the problem harder to spot as I didn't have any expectations or a way to measure my success or failure.\n\nSo my fix for this is to plan less stuff each day and to add a ton of padding between tasks. Over time, I found what works best for me and stuck with it. At the beginning I was anxious while planning because I thought I wouldn't follow it afterward. But with time and success I have proven to myself that I could follow plans If they are designed to be followed by me.\n\nFor starters, try to add things gradually and experiment with how long it takes you to switch from one task to another? how long can you maintain your focus before you need a small break? how long before even small breaks don't work and you need a long break?

All my how to’s live in OneNote with a million screenshots and template verbiage for anything that needs writing.\n\nIn my personal life, stuff gets written in Apple Notes or Google Keep (depending on which kind of phone I was using in that phase of my life). I also made mental notes about where I put things down by default so that I can put a basket there to “collect” the things I put down. My purse gets put down in one of 3 places, so I’m not checking all over the house, it’s in one of 3 spots (usually depending on what I notice first when I walk in the door).\n\nThe Chair holds my clothing that’s worn but re-wear-able.\n\nI’ve got a magazine holder that holds all the mail that’s not urgent (medical EOBs for insurance for example). \n\nWhen my body feels anxious, I put my hand in a cup of ice water. When my mind is anxious, I listen to classical or relaxing music. If I’m too amped to listen to relaxing music then I’ll listen to regular music because I start singing along and that art least gets me breathing without hyperventilating. \n\nI’ve also gotten a lot better with therapy, at giving myself partial credit. I don’t have the energy to fully wash in the shower today so I rinse off my boat out my hair, even if I don’t do both. I don’t have healthy food at home (or none of it sounds good), fast food is better than no food.\n\nIf I don’t see a thing, it doesn’t exist, so I limit how stuffed my refrigerator gets so that I can easily see everything when I open the door. That means there’s a lot of empty space, but it also means there’s a lot less wasted food. \n\nI actually found a lot of really good tops and tricks on Pinterest by looking up adhd or adhd organization (or RSD), or whatever it is I’m wanting tricks for. The pins are usually one-pager type visuals which means I get the info quickly, which is nice, not having to read an entire thing. It’s just the cliff notes versions.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767847943.0, "id": "nycdgv4", "author": "CloudDancing108"}

I'm about a full time semester off from an associates in one subject and I was in what should have been my last semester of my bachelor's in a different subject this fall. I did so poorly (while already on probation) that I'm pretty sure I got dismissed from my college while only 12 credits away from getting the piece of paper. I maxed out my federal loans (no private loans, thank god), spent way too long making way too little and not even getting college credit for it, and now my path to graduation is looking even longer and more difficult than it was 5 months ago. \n\nI'm not gonna give you the \"go at your own pace, everyone is different and there's no wrong way to do college\" answer everyone else is giving (but they're right, listen to them) because right now I feel like a complete failure who had so many chances to do something that some very *stupid* people seem to have minimal issues with, I'm behind the 8 ball with my friends, I can't really explain to everyone who isn't close to me why it's taken so long, and I'm embarrassed and ashamed about it. It fucking SUCKS. I still don't think I've processed how much I royally fucked myself but not just \"getting my shit together\" and passing this semester. I was so fucking close. But at the same time, I didn't have it. I never did. I was setting myself up for failure every single semester, over and over, and expecting different results. \n\nI mostly want to sympathize and let you know you're not alone. I'm just starting to get to the point where I care way less about getting the piece of paper as soon as humanly possible and way more about just being \"okay\" right now, but if I could go back in time I would've done it way differently. If you don't take care of yourself mentally and physically, especially as a person with ADHD, no amount of drive and determination is going to make you succeed at college, and it's okay to not succeed at college *right now*. It's just not okay for *me* to not succeed at college lol. \n\nTldr, I relate and I know how it feels, and it is possible to be okay with your adult academic life looking different than you want it to.
