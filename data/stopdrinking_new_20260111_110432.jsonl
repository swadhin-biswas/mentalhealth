{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "Tell me your story. While I’m not brand new, I’m seeking guidance from those who once felt they didn’t know who they were. If you can’t offer guidance, give your story regardless.", "text": "TL;DR:. Tell me your story. I’m telling some of mine. whether you’re new, back at it, Or decades sober. I’d like to hear you contribute.\n\nHi all,\n\nEverybody, especially addicts, have a story. Sharing these stories can be cathartic,  traumatizing, insightful, or inspiring.\n\nI’ve been off alcohol for about 2 years and two months now. I’ve had had a good 16 months of full sobriety before I began exploring or revisiting things other than alcohol. I never got physically and mentally addicted to anything else the way I did booze, but I definitely put a big pause on the progress I was making. I realized while I was having fully sober days, there was still this sense of escapism. That due to my substance use starting from at age of 12, I never really let myself “become” anyone. Well I obviously did, but who is he?\n\nYou know the accurate trope for many addicts. That they wake up one day not knowing who they are anymore? That they got lost somewhere and need to get back home? I’ve never had that. I’m multiple weeks fully sober, still same 14 months alcohol free. I’ve been attending groups, going to therapy and I’ve been trying new things as often as I can. I feel like a piece of me is terrified that “What if who I am doesn’t like anything except consumption?” Not just consumption of substances but of food, books, media, and heavy phone dopamine addiction. A consumer not a creator.\n\nI’m grateful to have many many very close friends and family. Despite being introverted, I have a LOT of good people in my life. They all speak so highly of me. I try as often as I can to uplift them in kind. I don’t need to solicit hearing earnest kind words like “people are drawn to you”, “you put people at ease”, and “you’re one of the most compassionate people I know.” I sure as hell would like to know this guy people talk about. My goal for this year is “learn to be confidently, fully myself, whoever the hell that is.” Do I subconsciously have people fooled or\n\nAll I know about myself is the following:\n\n1. I am an addict and my life is incompatible with substances\n\n2. I love to cook learn , read, and write. I’m nourishing that to the best of my ability \n\n3. I’m a dreamer but undisciplined. I abhor routine but do well under it \n\n4. I’m lucky. While life has been difficult, I’m not my trauma, I’m not the trauma I’ve caused others, and when confronted with these feelings I need to sit with them. My community is one of my greatest assets. Don’t ruminate and take accountability.\n\n5. I am an introverted extrovert. I need people, but I’ve always needed a real extrovert to kick that door in. How do I learn to do this on my own? How do I learn to love myself and know myself the way my loved ones know me? If I had a 1/3 of the qualities people thrust up on me I’d at least be a flawed and interesting person I’d want to know.\n\nSo for the once lost, currently lost, the miscreants, ne’er do wells, those who started drinking too soon or too much - how did you get to know yourself? What about love yourself? Has a book or hobby or habit helped you? Is there something you revisit when you feel lost? \n\nWhile I am seeking guidance, I’m also seeking  fearless\n\nconnection. if you don’t have wisdom it I’d love to hear your stories, tell me about you, your journey, your new found or revisited spark. Whether two days sober or twenty years, your voice is valuable. \n\nHell, even making this post I kinda chuckle at the irony of knowing I’m not my thoughts but here I am pathologizing, seeking answers to questions that don’t have one. If they do, they’re mine alone to answer.\n\nIt might just be mindset, self nurturing, and time. Connection in the mean time won’t hurt.\n\nTL;DR: Tell me your story. Whether you can offer guidance as somebody who also stunted themself with alcohol before developing hobbies or knowing yourself, what helped you with this in your sobriety? \n\nFor those who did know but lost themself, what kept you straight &amp; narrow while sobriety walked you home?  \n\nLastly, if you’re in the same boat with me &amp; have no true understanding of who you are tell me your story. Sometimes commiserating or even saying your story out in the ether helps.  You, myself, or passersby’s.\n\nBooks, media, mindset , habits, hobbies, speaking the yet unspoken. Anything that helps or helped that was strictly for you, I’d love to hear it. I don’t mind if you have no guidance, I hope you use this thread to share your story &amp; perspective because it matters \n\nIMWNDWYT", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768103753.0, "id": "1q9p63x", "author": "justathrowawayforth", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q9p63x/tell_me_your_story_while_im_not_brand_new_im/"}

I don't touch liquor, my weight is healthy and not increasing. I do not get \"drunk\" or really change how I act. I just drink it. I never wakeup hungover or late for work. I fear what used to be a habit has no turned into more of a dependency as I look forward to getting home from work and cracking open a nice cold beer.\n\nThe only nights I don't drink is if I'm sick, and when my wife was in the hospital due to pregnancy complications and I would need to drive at a moments notice. It was during this time I realized my sleep improved, energy levels went up, and anxiety decreased. \n\nI suffer from anxiety as well. Although this has improved DRAMATICALLY over the years, I started drinking more to relax and it started to take a bit more over the years to reach that same relaxing state.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "First of all, good for you knowing you are aware of your problem and trying all you can to control it. Always know that. \n\nI am only speaking from my experience. I've been thru rehab twice for drinking. It's damn hard to quit it. It's like losing your security blanket of coping with things in life. I felt like I was stripped of my security blanket and forced to walk naked into the world. It's scary, overwhelming and very humbling. \n\nI too started drinking after my daughter was born. Being a parent was overwhelming to me. I was young, married &amp; had recently started living on my own with my husband. It was a huge change in life for me. I realized a lot my first stint in rehab. People i thought were my friends were nowhere to be found once they learned I couldn't drink anymore. I got treated like I had some contagious disease. It hurt bad being treated that way. I felt even more overwhelmed and lonely. My 2 year marriage was falling apart because he didn't have a drinking problem, I did. We were young and he didn't understand addiction, so naturally he couldn't give the support I needed after rehab. \n\nMy counselor advised me to attend AA meetings as well. I went to several meetings over the course of a few months, but there was something nagging about those meetings that never sat right with me. I still felt like I was being judged at almost every meeting. I ended up going to an NA meeting even though my addiction wasn't drugs, it was alcohol. I never felt more welcomed than I did at those NA meetings. I felt belongingness there. It was something I'd never felt at AA meetings. \n\nMy life changed again about 10 years later and I fell off the wagon. I went thru rehab again after several years off the wagon. One thing that always stuck in my head was something my counselor said to me during my 2nd rehab stint.. he said in order to stay sober, you only have to change 1 thing. That 1 thing is everything. You need to change everything. I did just that. I changed everything, except sell the house and move. I drastically changed careers and I believe that's what helped save me. I needed something drastic to shift my focus onto. AA doesn't always work for everyone.. we all don't fit into a cookie cutter lifestyle suggested way of living. I appreciate what AA is about, but I've surrounded myself with other ways that help keep me sober. My job has screwy hours with no set schedule, so that sort of helps keep my brain focused. Plus, I read a lot of self help books, articles &amp; listen to self help podcasts and audiobooks. Like they say in the program, take what you need and leave the rest. I've gradually worked my own program to keep me straight. I challenge myself and my skills.. it keeps that nasty little monster from chatting in my brain to just have a drink. \n\nYou can do this honey. I have faith in you, and I'm not just saying empty words here..I believe in you and you can do this. Yes, it's hard as hell somedays, but you've gotta look at the rewards of sobriety and also challenge yourself each time you get an urge or when that nasty little monster starts his chatting in your brain. Cook something you've never made before, read a self help book, go for a drive and turn on a podcast, volunteer to help someone do something, whatever it may be to shift your focus away from that chatter until it passes. There's a lot of love and support on this sub, so please keep coming back.. daily, hourly, etc.. as long as you need to keep coming back. Hang in there. You can do this.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "2 Year Sober-versary", "text": "Two years ago today, I was discharged from the hospital after being treated for sepsis caused by alcoholic ketoacidosis, and after being medically detoxed.\n\nIt wasn’t my first detox.\n\nFourteen months earlier, I had gone through one before, convinced I just needed a break. I wasn’t committed to sobriety. I told myself that one day I could drink again, that *one drink couldn’t hurt*. That lie nearly cost me my life.\n\nThat “one drink” became a week-long binge I have no memory of. I stopped eating. My body, desperate to survive, tried to sustain itself on alcohol alone. I was actively dying, and the only reason I ended up in the ER was because I collapsed on my bedroom floor, violently vomiting, unable to keep even a sip of water down.\n\nAnd what terrified me most wasn’t that I couldn’t drink the water.\nIt was that I couldn’t drink more vodka.\n\nMy husband was deployed. I was alone. I was taken to the ER, where the first hours of detox brought horrific hallucinations; images and sensations I wish my brain had never learned how to create. Nurses struggled to find a vein. A newer nurse dug so deeply she caused nerve damage; I lost all feeling from my wrist to my elbow. That numbness didn’t begin to fade until six months ago.\n\nThe experience was traumatic. And the realization that I had almost killed myself was undeniable.\n\nAfter my first detox, I hadn’t healed. I was still carrying the weight of my alcoholism. Still shut off from the world. Still holding my shame in silence.\n\nToday, two years later, everything is different.\n\nI’ve committed to a lifetime of sobriety, and the difference is profound. I’ve finally started healing the trauma I once tried to outrun with alcohol. I’m in the best shape of my adult life at 36. My relationships are deeper, more honest, more open than I ever thought possible. And for the first time in as long as I can remember, I genuinely believe my life is good, and worth living.\n\nI’m… dare I say it… happy.\nAnd that is enough for me.\n\nSo here’s to two years.\n\nAnd if you’re reading this with two hours, two days, or two months, wherever you are in your journey, please hear this: it gets better, even if you can’t believe that yet.\n\nThe hopelessness, the darkness, the voice telling you there’s no way out, it’s a lie! A trick your mind plays when it’s worn down by addiction and fear. It feels real because you’re inside it, but it is not the truth of who you are or what your life can be.\n\nThere *is* light on the other side of this. I couldn’t see it either. I was certain my life was over. But slowly, quietly, that light found me, and one day I realized I wasn’t just surviving anymore. I was living.\n\nYou don’t need to see the whole path forward. Just stay. One moment, one choice at a time. The darkness doesn’t win.\n\nYour life is worth fighting for. \n\n💜\n", "score": 38, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768097570.0, "id": "1q9mzdg", "author": "MzPernicious", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q9mzdg/2_year_soberversary/"}

I tried to get them to do sober things SO MANY TIMES and they never wanted to. Rather than involve me in planning it, which hurt but I got over it, I got a “We’re having a sober Christmas party if you’re interested in stopping by,” as if they just figured I wasn’t coming. ", "score": 20, "created_utc": 1768098610.0, "id": "nywgd8l", "author": "Other_Job_6561"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "It takes time for your subconscious to catch up to your conscious decision making. \n\nEvery time you drank because you were anxious / stressed / nervous you were teaching your subconscious that alcohol is the quickest way to resolve those feelings. Depending on how long you've been drinking, those neural associations can run deep and as such, take time to unwind. \n\nThe book Alcohol Explained does a great job of illustrating that the speed at which alcohol affects us (i.e. very quickly) is why our subconscious says \"yes, this is a good solution to the current problem\". On the flip side, all of the negative effects from alcohol happen some time period after such that your subconscious' ability to attribute those things to the alcohol is long gone.\n\nYou are not a fraud if you are not drinking! To help solidify your motivation, I encourage you to take note (either mentally or literally in a journal) every time you notice something positive about sobriety. Waking up refreshed, feeling energized, being emotionally calm. The intention there will start to teach your subconscious that you don't need alcohol.\n\nTLDR: it takes time for your brain to understand the why; the only thing you need to focus on right now is abstaining. \n\nSidenote, I can't recommend Alcohol Explained enough. Understanding all of the negative physiological effects that alcohol imparts onto truly every part of the human body was such a huge step in my intrinsic motivation to stop.\n\nYou're crushing it, keep up the great work! \n\nIWNDWYT", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768099221.0, "id": "nywi9c4", "author": "Slippery__Slope__"}

Conveniently, there is a sober group in my city that had a ski trip planned this weekend, but the universe had other plans for me I guess.  A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer, and I am currently stuck in and out of the hospital ripping through chemotherapy rounds. \n\nCancer sucks.  I don't have anything insightful to say about my diagnosis or the way that my life has to be right now for me to get better.  But, I do feel grateful that I got sober and learned how to start to live and feel.  \n\nThe last few years of my drinking were painfully lonely, and I was ready to kill myself over obstacles far more trivial than a metastatic cancer diagnosis. I basically had nothing and no one in my life, and I moved from temporary situation to temporary situation sucking up everyone and everything around me until I felt I was being asked to leave.\n\nOne thousand days later, my life is completely unrecognizable.  I have had a lot of real accomplishments, and it's easy to point to the most tangible ones (career, physical appearance, etc.) to communicate to people who used to know me that I have started to get better.  While it's really easy to show someone else and external change, I find it very difficult at times to show someone how you have changed internally.  \n\nThe day I finally went to detox and decided quit for real, I thought I was making the choice to not wake up with withdrawals every morning, to not have to make excuses for why I was late to work all the time, to not have to go to 3 different liquor stores every day to hide how much alcohol I was buying, etc.  And while I have certainly outgrown all of those things, I did not truly understand the journey I was embarking on until much later.  Working an active program has taught me to build relationships, set boundaries, have goals and try to accomplish them, how to be comfortable with myself, and how to experience feelings (sometimes bad feelings).  It took having these gifts gradually appear in my life as I continued to live sober to prove to me that I truly was drinking to die toward the end.  \n\nI would never say this in a cancer sub or group meeting, but I am confident that this cancer won't kill me.  For a diagnosis like mine, testicular cancer is pretty well cured as long as you get the treatment (which is brutal).  If I start drinking again, I will not only die young, but I will also deprive myself of the chance to ever have lived in the first place.\n\nIf you're new to sobriety or haven't strung a day sober in a long time want to, be kind to yourself.

Long story short, I was in a bad way last April already when my dad had a serious stroke. That was unfortunately the catalyst I needed to finally take the plunge and quit drinking. It's been a long, scary, incredibly challenging 262 days, but all things considered I am in a much better place now than I ever thought possible even with everything going on. \n\nDoctors had been telling me to quit for health reasons for several years, and I can't believe I waited so long to listen. \n\nAnxiety and blood pressure are in check and I'm off of 2 blood pressure meds and one anxiety med. Insomnia is still a major challenge but I'm getting much better sleep now that I'm not drinking. I've resolved many financial issues in my life and headed back towards a normal credit score. Most recently I've re-enrolled in school and working to finish my almost-completed bachelor's degree from over 10 years ago. \n\nLife still sucks sometimes. Dad's health is still poor. Working, caregiving, and traveling 200 miles between those two responsibilities every week is wearing on me. The desire to drink comes on strong when the going gets tough, but I've stayed strong even with other caretakers drinking in the house and reuniting with old drinking buddies now that I'm back in my home town more. \n\nStopping drinking didn't solve all of my problems, but boy did it help.\n\nIf you are considering quitting, there is no time like the present. If I have one regret, it's not doing it sooner. \n\nThanks to everyone on here for the support and help along the way. This is only my second post in 8 months, but I've been lurking and the stories, good and bad, have helped keep me going. I've learned so much from all of you, and I thank you all.\n\nIWNDWYT,\n\nColin\n\nEdit: deleted and reposted due to typo in the subject. 262 days, not 272.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768092025.0, "id": "1q9kvcw", "author": "colinthegreat", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q9kvcw/262_day_update/"}

When alcohol leaves your system, chemical imbalances conspire to convince you of this lie. They last, compound, and eventually you’re living in its reality rather than your own.\n\nI know that quiet, unfun, anxious person really well. It’s me, and all of us, when the booze is in charge. I know that personable, relaxed, anxiety-free illusion of self, too - it’s what we tell ourselves we are with it, when what others see is often something quite different. It can take years, decades even, for that incongruence to be too hard to ignore.\n\nEthanol affects every body the same way, and yes, early on, the difference of drunkenness can be appealing. But I no longer believe some people “can handle it/moderate” and others can’t—rather, some people use alcohol as a purposeful tool, and others don’t. It’s a psychological/behavioral difference, and over time because of the damage it does, everyone slides to the former. Tool users who feel useless and valueless without our tool.\n\nYou’ve just shared that you use the first way, so now we’re friends. Welcome to team “this ends up being terrible.” The sooner you stop, the sooner you’ll steal back all those good traits for yourself (call it self-confidence). \n\nYou don’t *have* to do anything, but it always leaves with those good things of yours eventually, and it’s so amazing when you take them back.

You’re putting a barrier between yourself and growth and convincing yourself that alcohol is somehow the answer when it will only take years of your life from you. There are other options for managing anxiety. There are plenty of people out there who suffer from anxiety and manage it without alcohol, you can do the same. Alcohol is insidious and the addiction makes us lie to ourselves. I can guarantee you that your friends and family will still love you if you stop drinking, and there is a path of happiness for you that doesn’t include alcohol. I don’t know how to help you, other than to just be real and honest with you. My dad thought no one could tell either, but most of my memories of him were him being either a way too happy drunk or being passed out and not present because the more you drink the more you need to drink to feel normal. He died at 46 from cirrhosis of the liver. I would rather my son know me as moody and irritable than as an alcoholic. But you know, it’s been years now since I drank and I have nightmares about relapsing because I’ve never been happier than I am now. I quit drinking when I was in my 20s, and I felt just like you do now. Alcohol is an addictive substance and you are no exception. It will only get worse.

When I don’t go out for a walk, the day feels much harder to get through &amp; my self-talk is a lot more harsher.\n\nSometimes even just making sure I’ve showered and made myself a home cooked meal, watched a comfort show/film or put a face mask on makes me feel like I’ve accomplished something because I *still* have not drank any alcohol. \n\nEverything else can wait right now. This stage of your life is just about getting through today/tomorrow/this week without drinking. \n\nBut my biggest piece of advice: keep yourself away from anyone who may directly or indirectly sabotage your sobriety. My biggest triggers are my family (as they don’t like to respect my boundaries) so I limit the time and energy I spend on/with them. Again, the ‘I am sober’ app has also shown me the pattern of me interacting with them = triggers my depression and increases my urge to drink vs minimal to none/low-effort interactions with family = stronger sense of self and will to remain sober.\n\nIf you haven’t tried therapy, I would highly suggest this as they might be able to help you with some coping tools.\n\nAnd if you don’t feel comfortable opening up to your friends/family about your depression and anxiety, try journaling or ChatGPT (just don’t rely too much on the latter as it usually just tells you what you want to hear, or will repeatedly redirect you to mental help services instead - rightfully so, but sometimes you just need to vent lol).\n\nIWNDWYT🤍", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768098301.0, "id": "nywfegz", "author": "Responsible-Fill-113"}

So I tried on my own. Made it exactly zero days.\nToday I am 64, which is so incredibly strange. They ain’t lying when they say life is short. Today I am also planning to stop drinking — again!!! I’m choosing Monday because by then the booze will be gone and my husband will be back from a road trip.\nThey also aren’t lying when they say alcoholism is a progressive disease. I’m worse now than I’ve ever been.\nMind you, I’ve quit a bunch of times before. For pregnancy, of course, but also because I’ve been successful at sobriety. Needless to say, relapse sucks. I want this to be the last time I quit. I want many sober years before I die. Mostly, I don’t want to die. If I keep this up, I will.\nI’m not yet ill from drinking, as far as I know. And I’d very much like to feel joy again before I die. There is no joy in drinking.\nSo kudos to you. Guard your sobriety with everything you’ve got!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "Day 14 : I’d like to share my journey", "text": "Greetings all, long time lurker but I’ve never posted or commented as I never felt it was fair to those making a real attempt at sobriety. I’ll try to condense things as much as possible but it will be a lengthy post. \n\n**Background**: \nI moved to a new city all by myself in November 2017 and within a month met the woman I’d eventually marry. I was 24 at the time and she was 21. She was also one of the few girls I’d ever met that actually liked whiskey. We were both already heavily into the electronic music scene and did our fair share of substances on the weekend, especially early in our relationship. However, alcohol was always our thing. We drank 3-4 days per week whether it was bars, concerts, at the pool or even just chilling at home. \n\nEverything changed when COVID hit in 2020, my wife was furloughed at the time and I was working from home. It was fun at first, we could drink all day and had no obligation to be anywhere. We were in a small 1 bed 1 bath apartment at the time, the only space for a desk was in our bedroom. I’m on the phone for work a lot so she’d be trying to sleep while I’m on the phone with contractors at 7am. We decided we wanted more space, started house hunting and wound up finding a great house in the suburbs for a great price. \n\nWe got married in New Orleans in May 2023, drinking was a huge part of the experience. We managed to not get too lit and had a wonderful time that we actually were able to remember. \n\n**when the problem started** \nI was part of a 2 man team managing the financial side of a $350,000,000 construction project. He was a great boss, mentor and friend. In January 2024 he called me out of the blue to say he’s leaving the company to start his own. I was happy for him but it put a ton of pressure on me as I was now having to handle his client-facing responsibilities and work load on top of my responsibilities. I also had to travel once per month for a site visit which was something he’d normally do since he lived in town. \n\nI had been pretty good about not drinking during work hours but as the stressed piled up I found myself making a run to the liquor store in the late morning/early afternoon to get 3-4 of those disgusting 99 proof liqueur shots. Soon that became a daily habit plus my wife would bring home some shots when she was off work. \n\nLater that year my wife and I had a week long stay at an all inclusive resort in Mexico, I was beyond excited to step away from work plus I could drink as much as I wanted. I blacked out a few days and also got cut off a few times. Our last night there we were both shitfaced and got into an argument that cumulated in my wife screaming **“you’ve ruined the one vacation that we had together this year. I hate you. Do you hear me? I fucking hate you!”** I’ll never forget it, she fell asleep immediately after and when we woke up to head to the airport she didn’t even remember it. While she was apologetic and affectionate, I knew there was a part of what she said that was true. I hated myself and knew what we had grown into wasn’t sustainable. That’s when I recognized that I had a problem. \n\nI was getting burnt out of the job due to the lack of support plus the project itself was nearing completion. My former boss called me out of the blue in march 2025 saying a friend of his needed help on a $7,000,000,000 project. I transitioned jobs because that was good good of an opportunity to pass up and that’s where I work currently. The project is unlike anything I’ve ever worked on but it is stressful, demanding and chaotic. \n\nThose 3-4 99 shots turned into a daily 8 and I’d be at the liquor store 20 minutes after it opened. I’d been battling a depression because it felt like I traded one stressful job for another. I got started on Zoloft which provided immense relief at first but it kinda plateaued after a few weeks so I had my dr up the dosage in early December 2025. \n\n**the tipping point** \nOn 12/27/25 my wife dragged me to one of those timeshare presentations where they try to sell you the world but you get a free week vacation even if you don’t buy anything. I felt weird all morning and was having some sort of double vision (while sober) and overall just felt off. The presenter even noticed something was off and asked if I was alright. I was just focused on getting through the presentation so we could grab some drinks and go home plus my parents were coming into town and I was excited to see them. I remember greeting them and watching some football but that’s about it. That would be my last day drinking. \n\nI woke up on 12/28/25 with a hangover, but it felt different than other hangovers. I was sweating and shaking profusely as well as constantly vomiting even though my stomach was empty. My mom eventually convinced me to go to the ER. \n\nWe sat in the waiting room for 2 hours before my name was called. I could barely walk to the wheelchair they brought for me. During the assessment I had a seizure followed by a loss of pulse and I was turning cyanotic (blue). CPR was administered along with defibrillation, upon return of pulse I was given epinephrine and then moved to the ICU. My wife, as my emergency contact, got to be the one to receive the news and then inform my parents. \n\nI woke up with my hands restrained to a bed, ventilator tube down my throat and a Foley catheter in my manhood. Also was given fentanyl for the pain / sedation so I had no idea what was going on. My dad stayed overnight with me, my poor wife had been through so much emotionally that day and needed rest. She and my mom fell asleep on the living room couch watching comfort movies. \n\nMy dad informed me of the events that transpired but I was unable to speak due to the intubation. The nurse suggested seeing if I could write on a piece of paper, first thing I wrote was “tube out” which wasn’t gonna happen yet. Then “water” which was not possible with the tube. After that was “nose itch” which resulted in my dad scratching all over my nose until he finally found the spot, it was fairly comical. The last thing I wrote was “photo” and my dad got an amazing photo of me, hooked up to all these machines, ice pack on my head, with a thumbs up. I wanted the photo as a reminder of what I did to myself. Another notable part was how much my dad held my hand and even at one point kissed my forehead saying “you got this buddy”. I can’t even remotely remember anything like that happened with him. \n\nOnce I was stable and able to breathe on my own (around 24 hours) they removed the tube which hurt but pales in comparison to the removal of the Foley catheter. That was probably the worst thing I have ever physically experienced. \n\nI spent a total of 10 days in the hospital, first 2 were in the ICU before “graduating” to a regular hospital room. Tests were ran and images were taken. Had to be honest about my drinking as my liver was enlarged and unhappy. An MRI revealed a heart condition (genetic) called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, essentially a thickening of the heart walls that can cause arrhythmia and makes the heart work harder. I had to have surgery to get a defibrillator implanted in my chest in the event that my pulse ever stops again. \n\nI’m lucky to be alive, who knows what would have happened if I seized up and went into cardiac arrest at home. The lead cardiologist referred to it as a “death attempt”. I was fortunate to be going through the initial withdrawals while under medical supervision, they hooked me up with anti nausea and anti seizure medications. To be honest, the cravings haven’t even been that bad since I was discharged. \n\nThis event made me realize how fortunate I am to have a strong support system. My wife was amazing the whole time, she was strong and caring, stayed in the hospital with me every night besides the first. She even called my boss from my cell phone to inform him of the situation. My parents stayed at our house for over a week longer than originally planned to help with our household and be there to support me and my wife. It makes me feel awful about who I was at the height of my drinking. The hiding it, the excuses to “run out” to do something just so I could grab more drinks, falling asleep in the middle of the day, gaining weight, no interest in hobbies, knowing which stores open early on the weekend, vomiting all the time, stumbling around at concerts, the list could go on forever. \n\n12/27/25 was the day of my last drink and I am ready to take sobriety seriously. I know it won’t be easy but I’ve been given a new lease on life and plan on making the most out of it. I’ve already joined an outpatient program and also look forward to utilizing this community. \n\nI Will Not Drink With You Today.

I took note of my alcohol dependence a while ago, but after last summer  things snowballed downhill and I started losing control (or maybe not caring, like depression it can be cyclical). My mental health plummeted a scary amount. \n\nDuring December I recognized I needed a change before I lose complete control and ruin my life. For the first time in a while, I started thinking to the future. I wanted to continue life in the best way possible, and part of it is with a good grasp on my relationship with alcohol. I don’t know if I’ll cut it out completely, but setting boundaries doing dry january felt like a less-scary start. I really just take it day by day, and I’ve already noticed improvements. \n\nShort story long, I could not be happier that I didn’t go out and drink with my friends last night (if I weren’t doing dry january I know that I would have). Apparently the night started fine for them, but things took a turn for the worse when they got to the bar. Two of my friends drank way more than they should have in a very short period of time (on top of not eating proper dinner). My sober friend there was the dd, and apparently it was messy. \n\nI was told they kept stumbling, spilling people’s drinks, falling over many times, and had to be carried out of the bar. Also throwing up inside/outside of the bar. Then in the car which still needs to be cleaned. They don’t drink like that often at all, and I think they just forgot their tolerance, but it was an all around a very bad situation. I feel empathetic because I know that being that drunk sucks ass, especially having to face everything the morning after. Obviously if I were there (sober) I would have helped them get home and be safe, but I’m so glad I didn’t go out. It felt like a reminder for why I’m doing this. I know it sounds crude to call that terrible night a mini win for myself, but that’s honestly how I feel. \n\nBefore, I never thought I could stay sober for long periods of time, now I have confidence in myself that I can :)\n\nIWNDWYT", "score": 6, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768084718.0, "id": "1q9i02p", "author": "BigGuarantee4134", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q9i02p/friends_went_out_so_glad_i_didnt/"}

Why can’t you just have one and have some fun like everyone else?” - “Oh come on, we actually don’t have a problem, let’s just have a little bit!” \n\nIn those moments, I consciously look for inner wisdom to step in and ask for advice.

I've known for quite some time that I wanted to stop drinking but it has been one of the hardest things I've ever attempted. I kept thinking that I could limit myself and slowly stop but would wind up drinking 2-4 drinks after work, and 8-10 drinks a day on the weekend. I wouldn't even feel drunk, just sluggish and it would ruin my sleep and the morning after. \n\nSomething just hit me last week and I became determined. I asked myself what positives I was gaining from alcohol... I couldn't come up with anything. One of the biggest tests was going out to dinner last night with a girlfriend I haven't seen for 10+ years. She ordered a margarita and I was SO tempted to do the same. I ended up ordering a mocktail. \n\nI've been more present this week than I have been in years. What helps is long walks after work, writing on my calendar that I didn't drink that day, and reading all of your stories. I'm really trying to be kind to myself through this process and I hope you all do the same. We can do this!!

She was adamant on taking my bottom bunk and I was forced to sleep on a top bunk which I have a very hard time getting in and out of because of my lower back pain. It was a dirty disgusting old mattress with bugs crawling all around it. I asked my counselor to get me another bottom bunk but he refused, pushed me on the floor and we got into a fight with the woman who took my bottom bunk. The police were called and I was taken to jail for assault. My mom bailed me out and I went home. As soon as I got home, I started drinking and the feeling of never getting sober again started to fill me with dread. Then I started crying and asking God why I just can't stay sober. Why me? I ended up crying myself awake with tears in my eyes. While I slowly started to fade into a consciousness I started to see my bottom bunk with all my surroundings and my kitty pillow and Harry Potter blanket. I wiped the tears from my eyes. It was a nightmare. It felt so unbelievably real. I thought I threw away 53 days of sobriety. Waking up from that dream is one of the most reliving moments of my life. \n\nI wasn't arrested for assaulting a cop. I still have my bottom bunk. I still have my good health. I still have my 53 days. I still have my hope. I'm still going to complete this rehab program. \n\nStupid subconscious!

I read almost every post and each time I am deeply thankful for the sense of community and encouragement here.\n\nThank you to everyone out there from the bottom of my heart.\n\n90 days was the original stretch goal when I set out to do this.  I'm now going for 180.  Here are some thoughts:\n\n* I had 100's of day 1s.  The first breakthrough was a Dry Jan a few years ago.  Each length of being sober, no matter how small, matters.\n* During stretches of attempting to be sober, I always kept a journal.  It is cruel, unjust and down right evil how my mind would constantly try apply some sort of twisted bias on how wonderful being drunk could be and how much I was missing by being sober.\n* I accounted for every small change I could notice during my attempts and wrote them down.  I literally had to read that top to bottom each time I was tempted to drink as a reminder that my mind was somehow blocking. \n* I also did pushups out of anger when I wanted a drink.  Whatever I was feeling, I got down and did pushups until I collapsed. In the beginning I could barely do 10.  Now I'm hitting the gym 2-3x a week.\n* I used to smoke 15 yrs ago.  While smoking, I could not imagine ever getting up and having a coffee without a smoke.  Same thing with drinking.  I was terrified about losing my Sunday nights watching the game and drinking.  4-6 beers every day.  Benders.  Bottle of wine and 2 DIPAs. After 90 days, I can 100% say I no longer think like this.  Its unreal to me that this is possible.\n\nThis entire stretch of 90 has become an exercise in finding ways to fill the dopamine crush I used to get from drinking.  To me, 10 drinks and a night out with a fireplace and maybe some darts hits a dopamine score of 100.  Its damn near perfect....up until the morning where it goes to -100 dopamine, regret, pain in my stomach and ribs, swollen ankles and exhaustion.\n\nI have come to realize I will never again score a 100 in my life.  However, for me, this is how I'm slowly making the progress towards feeling alive without alcohol (and their related scores on what they mean to me):\n\n* Falling asleep in minutes (10)\n* Fat wallet (7)\n* Weight loss (7)\n* Redness in face is near gone (5)\n* Sex drive (5)\n* Staying calm in moments of crises (4)\n* Not being winded from climbing stairs (3)\n* Clear competitive thoughts and connecting the dots at work (3)\n* Desserts ( 2)\n* Remembering my dreams - which are not as violent as before (1)\n* Driving at night with zero stress (1)\n* Fitting into old clothes (1)\n* NA Beers (1)\n\nI want to say again to this group : you all mean the world to me.  I honestly feel for the first time in my life that I will live longer and be able to watch my kids get married or have kids.

It is what it is. You lost your job. So what! The best thing you can do is lean into it. You lost your job, and your best friend is dying. But what can you do about it? You lost your job, your best friend died, and your car broke down. We can’t control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond. Update your resume, make a few phone calls, and don’t sweat it. Pray for your friend and reach out to others who are also feeling the pain of your friend’s absence; it’s okay. Call someone who can help you with your car. But don’t get all worked up. It’s just a waste of energy.\n\n**Reflections**\n\nWhy do I lose my shit when things don’t go my way?

I was let go from a good job on December 19th. of that year. And my car blew a header the following month. It was rough. This last year, I was diagnosed with two tumors in my bladder, and currently, I am in the middle of cancer treatments. Everything I learned about how to deal with these moments, I learned in recovery. \"***We can’t control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond***.\" And with that response, I have learned to identify what is in my control and what isn't. A lot of that comes with time, but most of that comes with responding as I describe above. Responding with radical acceptance means taking action within my abilities, engaging with acceptance, and understanding what is reasonably within my power. Not reaching for the bottle. Not putting off what needs to be done. Not saying \"fuck it\" or denying the reality.\n\nStay active.

That's easy enough right?\n\nDecember the 19th, I had custody of my children (it's 50/50). I was 3 weeks sober then. But my girlfriend of almost a year took more and more place in my house. I never wished to have her at my home \"permenantly\". I told her she got to go at her home for the time being. Which she did.\n\nAs I went back from her home, I went to the liquor store to buy a bottle of whiskey. I had enough, I needed that. I already knew I was going to leave her. Truth is I wasn't yet ready to have a relationship after my breakup with the mom of my childs in August 2023.\n\nSo I drank. Kids didn't have their diner meal that evening. My daugther was not able to wake me up. Called her mother crying. Their mother came to get the kids at 11:30 pm. She was also not able to wake me up. I woke up in the morning with a note on the table. \"I came to get the kids, you know why\".\n\nI lost the costudy of my kids during the holydays. Starting December the 19th. The holydays after that were not good for me. Left my girlfriend, I was alone, I drank a lot.\n\nI also lost my best friend over something I did while we were both drunk, I was totally alone.\n\nDecember the 30th, I had my first ever suicidal thought. I called the crisis center the next morning to tell them that, I have so much pills at home it would be really easy, and asked what should I do. And I did a google research for that. \"Go to the emergency now\". Which I didn't.\n\nJanuary the 1st, something happened with the mother of my childs, which sent my in crisis. I don't want to talk about that particularly, but I was in distress, like I never had been. I talked to my ex in the morning. She was worried and called the crisis center. 2 social workers came to my home, unnanounced, talked to me. I explained the situation. They went off saying they were worried.\n\nAs the day passed, I was feeling less and less well. I called back to the crisis center to ask when is the right moment to decide when to go to the emergency. Had a small talk, told them I would think about it.\n\nThey (the social workers) came back a few hours later, maybe 9 PM. I told them I would refuse their services. We have a law here in Quebec called P38 that when someone is in danger for itself or somebody else, they can get taken care of against their will. That's what happened. Police showed up, I got into an ambulance, went to the hospital.\n\nI stayed at the psychiatric emergency for a day and a half. Tranfered to the detox center for 2 days (it went really well that time).\n\nThuesday I had a meeting with the CPS. I'm losing custody of my childs for 1 month and need to treat myself, or start doing this. I have the right to have my childs at least one time a week. They are coming for diner this evening :)\n\nI have a rendezvous with a psychiatrist at my clinic. After so long, I dont think the problem is alcohol. There's something else.

I’m really really proud of you for admitting that you need help even if they put you under hold at the psych hospital. I hope you can find the strength inside of you to keep going. You are so resilient and overcoming addiction will show you that you can do anything. And your kids will be so proud of you for doing so! You mentioned you’re in Quebec. I’m in Ontario, but I have a friend in Montreal who struggled with alcohol abuse as well. There are zoom meetings and in-person AA meetings in both French and English. If you google AA+the city you live in you will find one. The good thing about AA is that you can mingle and talk to people and make sober friends! After attending a few meetings, I met a couple other women there and now we hang out outside of meetings, doing healthy sober things like hiking, shopping, sitting around by the beach and playing badminton…once you get a circle of sober friends you’ll feel a lot better. You’re going through a lot with your ex so you need some supportive people in your life who can show you there is joy on the other side. If you’re not interested in AA there is also Smart Recovery. I hope your appointment with your psychiatrist goes well, my advice is be completely honest with her, they can hook you up with an addictions counsellor (it may take a while, this is Canada after all haha) but I don’t pay a dime to see my addictions counsellor. There is also the Affordable Therapy Network, check out their site and see if you can find a therapist within a price range that works for you. There are so many resources out there! I’m really rooting for you and your family, you can do this, just one day at a time. Just for today don’t drink - and the next day make a promise to yourself to not drink either - after a while the days will stack up and you’ll feel much better.

Then when the year end was coming I knew that would be my beginning-  but again, I just made an iron clad commitment to one month (Jan 2024). I used both times as experiments for improving my health - I wanted to see if I felt better and lost weight- (yes and yes). But I also made a promise to myself just for those time periods. When the end of Dry January 2024 was approaching I extended to February- then Lent fell in the middle of that month so I extended for Lent to 4-1. During this time period I took note of everything in my life that was improving (my weight, my skin, my sleep, my mental health - the list goes on and on). The thing is though - I really knew deep down that it really was my very last drink at 11:50 p.m. on 12/31/23 - I just knew that I couldn't tell my lizard brain/inner child that. I tricked myself (very similar to the way I tricked myself into quitting smoking 25 years ago).\n\nTL;DR: For me the most important thing at the beginning was that iron clad commitment of Dry January. and for many people that commitment has to be a daily time frame - hence \"I will not drink with you today\" or AAs One day at at time.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768054477.0, "id": "nysej04", "author": "Tough_Got_Going"}

The social side of it is also fun.  I connect with people 1-2x’s a week for an hour or two just competing.  I honestly would choose to play a match over wine at this point.  And that may sound crazy but it’s true.  \n\nI am so glad that your religion has brought you comfort in your journey.  There are so many ways to get past the dull part…for anyone out there stuck, just keep trying!  And keep coming back to share what works!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768047241.0, "id": "nyrwauu", "author": "Prudent_Twist_1259"}

When you are drinking alcohol, you are flooding your brain with an unnatural amount of dopamine.  In response, your brain kills off dopamine receptors and your dopamine threshold (the amount of dopamine something needs to generate for you to feel joy) is raised up.  At this new level, there is nothing in the world other than addictive substances that can cross the threshold, so when you initially quit drinking, everything in life feels meh, even hobbies and activities you used to love doing.\n\nOver time, your dopamine threshold will move back down to normal, and hobbies and activities will be fun again.  But it does take time.

It’s an amino acid that promotes calm focus, no drowsiness, and you can get it OTC for cheap. Increases GABA, improves sleep, and people who drink caffeine report it’s a perfect pairing (I believe prescribed stimulant users also take it to mitigate the unpleasant effects of those drugs). It has worked wonders for me. Take the recommended dose, no stupid “maxing.” I usually take it when I’m winding down for the day along with my multivitamin (which has some magnesium as I believe most do). It works within like 30 minutes, it’s tangible, not at all habit forming (I constantly forget to take it). Amazingly useful and gentle.\n\nI saw benefit from 5-HTP after quitting, another amino acid and a direct precursor to seratonin. It’s occasionally recommended to people with mild depression or intermittent depressive episodes, my doc mentioned it to me. In effect it acts as a mood stabilizer. Typically taken before bed, evening you out the next day. It definitely made me drowsy when I took it, and I did notice an evening out of sorts when I was consistent with it. It can make you kinda gassy.\n\nThese two amino acids in combination with a B-complex vitamin will go a long way to helping your mind and body adjust to a lack of alcohol.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768051210.0, "id": "nys5fml", "author": "BackupTrailer"}

Now that I’m sober I realize there is no such thing as a high functioning alcoholic, and I have the emotional regulation skills of my 18 yo self. I’m so ashamed that I’ve stifled my full potential all these years bc I could never handle life’s discomfort without the bottle. I feel like IM the baby\n\nLuckily I’ve been in therapy and things are getting easier. But when you use something as a crutch for so long and it gets taken away, life feels so lost and scary. I still have days where I just sit and cry my eyes out because I don’t know what to do when I’m stressed other than drink… so I just sit and helplessly cry until the feeling passes. For the sake of my baby I hope I’m able to stay on the sobriety journey. But this shit is not easy and it’s hard to tell how deep you’re in the hole until you try to dig yourself out. I see so many moms on social media talk about once they got pregnant they can’t even THINK about taking a sip of alcohol ever again. \n\nYou’re right OP some people really just have no idea", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768062476.0, "id": "nyt46fn", "author": "mmwg97"}

No matter how many times I said ‘I’m NOT going to the pub this week’ I found the little light switch would just ping on come 3 pm Thursday and my subconscious would start thinking about the pub and I’d message people and (so manipulative) tell them I was thinking about it, triggering their little light switch because once the thought is there we are all going to the pub.\n\nI found it very hard to break. But this time on quitting I would find myself thinking about it and say to my brain ‘we are not going to the pub we don’t drink any more’ , not as simple as just saying but I had also done the preparation in thinking this is just a thought, it’s not the law because I think something I have to do it, and I had thought a lot about all the reasons I do not want to keep up that habit, it’s still hard work, or I’d phone my husband and say it aloud ‘I’m just thinking about going to the pub but I know I said I won’t drink’ and he’d have a conversation with me and that small distraction was enough to disarm the notion long enough for me to get on the train home. \n\nI’ve done it enough times it is just a faint flicker now and I can ignore it because another neural pathway has been built to say ‘you always have this thought on a Thursday but now you ignore it’ \n\nSometimes I know it’s NOT actual beer I want but the ritual of recognising the week is almost over and believe it or not I now sometimes DO go to the pub but it’s for an NA Guinness or a soft drink. Because going to the pub was never solely about alcohol for me.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "Am I sober or do I just not drink anymore? Either way, a year has passed.", "text": "Hi there,\n\nOn January 5th, 2025, I finally did it — I stopped drinking alcohol. Not for a week, not until the weekend, not until the next holiday or my birthday, or any other date I used to set as a limit (or as a “fresh start” to drink again). No more rules like “no hard alcohol,” “no drinking alone,” “just beer,” or “only one booze-filled day on a weekend.” Done.\n\nI drank for nearly 20 years and finally stopped when I was 35. I never felt comfortable with myself. I was insecure, and when I discovered how alcohol made me feel — good, relaxed, confident — I fell in love with it. Nothing could stop me. I took every chance to drink. But once I started, I could never stop. One glass became one gulp, like someone lost in the Sahara finally finding water. Always. So every night was too much.\n\nMy drinking never sent me to the hospital, but it made me do bad things. My character changed, and I lost a lot of friends. When I was drunk, I didn’t care if the girl I liked was already someone else's (my friends) girlfriend. I became arrogant, reckless, and all my insecurities came out. No one wanted to spend time with me.\n\nI dated many girls, made them like the version of me I showed them, and when things got serious, I ghosted them. I moved to the countryside and started drinking with neighbors — but most of the time, I drank alone.\n\nA typical Friday: grocery shopping, a bottle of whiskey, and a “Kasten Bier” (that’s a crate of 20 half-liter bottles here in Europe). Two big packs of Marlboro, BBQ started, first beer. Second. Third. My girlfriend came home from work — we made whiskey coke. I finished mine in a minute, poured another, then another. She said, “You’re drinking fast today.” “It’s just my second one,” I lied. Another beer, so she wouldn’t notice. She went to bed; I stayed outside, drinking, smoking, listening to music until 2 a.m.\n\nAt 5 a.m., I woke up: heart racing, heartburn, no sleep. Did I call someone? No idea — I always deleted everything before bed. I took the dog out, feeling like shit, hoping not to meet anyone. Spent the day on the couch, shaking a bit when walking, regretting everything. Saturday evening: probably two or three beers again. Sunday: summer, so some wine (well, a bottle) at lunch. Or Aperol. Buzzed by 3 p.m., stopped at 4 because I had work on Monday. Work? Right. Those mornings, I went to the office praying not to get stopped by police.\n\nDuring rough times at work, I drank four to seven beers almost every night just to calm down. Over time, I lost interest in any activity that didn’t include alcohol. Even when cycling on my exercise bike, I had two whiskey cokes (Zero ...) next to me. I couldn’t imagine eating out without drinking. Even at my godchild’s second birthday, I was the one who opened the fridge to grab beer first. On vacations, I was drunk every day.\n\nAfter more than 10 years, I changed jobs. Better pay, a nicer company car, a big title. First day — I had a hangover and hoped no one would notice. I quit smoking. The result: I drank even more. I thought, “This can’t be right.” So I stopped drinking for four months. I was proud, told everyone. The new company was full of heavy drinkers, but I had no problem being the sober one.\n\nThe job turned out terrible, and I became depressed. After four months, my girlfriend and I went to a Brauhaus, and I thought it was the perfect time for a few “Altbier” and a pork knuckle. Three weeks later, I was fully back in the game.\n\nThen I got sick — a serious motor nerve disease. I lost my job, went from hospital to hospital, and drank a lot. After medical treatments, I even googled whether it was okay to drink afterward. When my health improved, we went on vacation — I got so drunk the first night that the whole club knew me. We met some great people who later spent Christmas at our house. I bought a lot of alcohol — three bottles of liquor, two crates of beer, twelve bottles of wine, twelve bottles of mulled wine. Not all of it got finished, but I was prepared.\n\nWe had a great weekend, but when the new year started, I felt awful. My pain came back, I’d gained a lot of weight, stopped training, and felt completely empty. On January 5th, 2025, I was already hungover for the fourth time that year. Drinking alone at night until I was drunk — again — arguing with my girlfriend, telling her how much I hated my life.\n\nThat day, I finally admitted to myself that I couldn’t control my drinking — that I drank because I was unhappy and trying to bury my thoughts.\n\nI told no one. The next days felt fine — like always after a hangover. But something was missing. I had nothing to look forward to. Drinking had been my only goal. So what now? How to celebrate, relax, fill time? What would I do with friends if I didn’t drink?\n\nMy close friends rarely drink, so I was always the one bringing alcohol and drinking most. At first, those situations were stressful — moments where I’d normally start drinking. But they passed. After 15, 30, maybe 60 minutes, the feeling was gone. And at the end of the night, lying in bed with my girlfriend, I thought: “That was a nice evening. Even without alcohol.”\n\nIn the early weeks, I often woke up in a panic: “What did I do last night? Did I drink?” Then I’d remember: “You idiot. You don’t drink anymore.” My godchild’s next birthday was great too. I could drive home, had good conversations, and discovered some lemonade I really liked. Bit by bit, I started enjoying things again — hiking without wine, dinners without booze, moments I’d forgotten.\n\nThe people I used to drink with? I haven’t seen them in a long time. And that’s fine.\n\nPhysically, I’m still struggling. I live with a chronic pain condition that affects my nervous system, and nobody can tell me if it will ever get better. My professional and financial future feels uncertain, and sometimes that thought alone can be heavy. But I know one thing for sure: drinking again would never make any of it better. It would only make everything worse — my health, my mind, my relationships, my hopes. I’m also getting married soon, and I know I can only keep my vows if I’m fully in control of myself — of what I do, what I say, and who I am. And that’s only possible when I’m sober.\n\nSo — am I sober? In German, we say trockener Alkoholiker — “dry alcoholic.” Or did I just stop drinking? It was easy for me to stop, but sometimes hard not to start again. I made a list in my head of what would happen if I “just had one.” One glass, then another, then a third. The next day I’d want one at lunch, waiting for the moment when it felt “okay” again to start drinking later that day.\n\nI have to admit that I can’t control my alcohol consumption. That’s why I can never drink again — not even for pleasure.\n\nAnd that’s why I will never drink alcohol again!\n\nIf you’ve read my story all the way to the end — thank you. I really enjoy reading all the stories here and feel genuinely happy for everyone who has found a new version of themselves. I wish every one of you the strength to build a good life without alcohol.", "score": 312, "num_comments": 48, "created_utc": 1768030998.0, "id": "1q8y4rx", "author": "southern_dude1809", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8y4rx/am_i_sober_or_do_i_just_not_drink_anymore_either/"}

My second marriage was my forever. She's it, I did it some how. She's the one. Or so I thought. I slowly destroyed her and my family.

My drinking allowed me to do bad things and I ended up with an HIV scare (false positve, HOLY FUCK!!) that brought the weight of the stars down on me. \n\nShortly before that fucking mind-bender started, I had my ah ha moment. A switch flipped and I said no more. I finally had reached the point where I could tell myself never again. That decision was one of the most powerful things I've done for myself because I've somehow stayed sober through this on going shit storm that that scare (I) created.\n\nAll my lies are out. There is nothing and nowhere to hide, not even in the bottle this time. I've been sober much longer than this (today is 42days) I've never been sober knowing it's forever. Sobriety was always a \"means to an end\". This sobriety is real and some day, as things heal, I hope to enjoy it like it's supposed to be. Am I sober or do I just not drink anymore? Yes.\n\nThanks for sharing your story, it obviously hit home for me!", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768059834.0, "id": "nysv16m", "author": "Ccasias83"}

But I want to save a lot of that for another day.\n\nAll I know is that without a shadow of a doubt, alcohol has waged a war on my soul for the past 15 years in ways I still don't fully understand. I'm not saying that I can point to drinking as the source of all my problems, but I am saying that I no longer viewed a lot of my problems as such because of drinking. And the problems it *would* create were \"solved\" by the thing itself, creating a vicious cycle of apathy. Apathy of the body and mind. One in the same.\n\nDream killer. Liver flayer. Relationship ender. Memory stealer. Job obliterator. Injury maker. Light taker. I'm done. No more half-measures. I give myself all the grace in the world to acknowledge how I ended up here but I'll be damned if I waste one more day choosing a black hole over life.\n\nI'm only 50 days in. A lot of strange feelings are coming up. But I am optimistic. Not a day goes by that my body doesn't wonder where our old friend has gone, or my mind doesn't play visions of cheap beer ads on an infinite loop. It's bizarre. I've always known I've had a problem but I didn't expect to have such a visceral reaction to removing alcohol from the equation.\n\nThe word \"alcoholic\" still intimidates me. Right now it feels more comfortable to simply say I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol to the point where the drawbacks outweigh the positives 100 to 1. That 1 kept me hanging on for so long. That 1 cost me a lot. That 1 was a lie. Was I having fun or was I just having a diluted version of hierarchical needs being met? What needs did drinking meet that I couldn't have gotten without it?\n\nMaybe this has something to do with my new path, maybe it doesn't. But today I laughed and really felt it in my chest. It came easy. It sort of tickled. I haven't laughed like that in a long time.\n\nI bid farewell to the monkey on my back, just for today. I'm not thinking about a few months from now, a few years from now, or even a few decades from now. I'm thinking about how there's a damn monkey on my back! Get this thing off me!\n\nSee you soon.

Turns out, my body was starting to sober up and woke me up to demand more alcohol.  After only 2 1/2 weeks, I go to bed and fall asleep on my own and sleep (mostly) through the night for a solid 7-9 hours.  It’s a whole ‘nother level!\nPhysical activity:  I lied to myself and said I was prioritizing my family by procrastinating on “me” things (yoga, a quiet cup of coffee, a walk) by saying “well, I need to make them breakfast, I need to pack lunches, I can have a quick seltzer so I feel normal and can be on top of things for them” until I suddenly was out of time for me.  Turns out, I am far less stressed/anxious and my fuse is 10x longer simply because I take an hour for myself in the mornings before everyone wakes up to check in here with a hot coffee while everyone is asleep and do 30 minutes of yoga before starting anything else.  The dog is happier with less anxious energy too because we’re doing twice daily walks (short AM one long PM one).  I realized that my “selflessness” was instead just selfishness and hiding my addiction.  Let me tell you, that was a humbling moment.\nReading:  I LOVE reading.  Physical books, specifically.  I had forgotten how it feels to have a book in my hand and turn the actual pages.  I’m enjoying it again.\n\nThis weekend, hubby’s BFF’s girlfriend told me this week that she wants to get into a sober activity with me and wants to start working towards not drinking as much/stretching more so she is coming over tomorrow morning to do her first yoga session with me and we are going to go for a walk after up to town to grab a coffee or tea at a local coffee shop.  Then brunch with friends at the bar where I work.  I’m excited for shrimp and grits and a virgin Bloody Mary (the mix we have at work is the best and I don’t even miss the vodka).  If shots are ordered, I will be having pickle juice.\n\nI feel inspired today.  Wishing all of you a sober and happy weekend! 💕\n\nIWNDWYT", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1768043808.0, "id": "nyrpkti", "author": "Lazy_Style4107"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "IWNDWYT! Usually I'm earlier to these threads, but I was a little tired and went to bed after deciding against a midnight meeting. I went to a lovely meeting last night, and tried to find another, but it seems that the second meeting no longer exists (last updated on the website in 2024, I showed up and there definitely was Not an AA meeting there). Too tired by 11:30 to get back out of bed lol.\n\nI woke my ass up this morning and forced myself into going to a 9:30 meeting (early for a Saturday!). I was certainly the youngest there, but it was a pretty fun and lively crowd. Lots of laughter. Some of us went to breakfast/brunch afterwards, and although my bank account is in the negative and I have to ration the $150 cash I have for the next two weeks (it was LITERALLY payday yesterday, but I've been on medical leave), I got some food and chatted with everyone. It was lovely. I feel lighter.\n\nDay 10/11 is where most of my relapses have occurred historically, so I'm on high alert right now. I'll be back on high alert near the end of the month, as it's the anniversary of my stepsister's death--she died, 8 days before her 23rd birthday back in 2023. It's grief I have yet to address. \n\nIn terms of self-care, I really haven't done much of that in the past few years. I've been living to work and drink. My home had fallen into disarray, I'd regularly go weeks without washing my hair or brushing my teeth, etc. I'm building those habits back up now, and I'm tackling one room at a time for deep cleaning. \n\nI'm almost done tossing all the empty wine bottles scattered around my apartment (there must've been hundreds), and I think I'll tackle my recycling and fridge next.\n\nAnd of course, my newest form of self-care is going to meetings! Right now, I'm aiming for one or more a day. I figure if I was drinking multiple times every day, then I've got time to hit a meeting too, right?\n\nI'm also meeting up with someone to discuss sponsorship on Monday, before a meeting she'll be the secretary at. She seems cool, made sure I got the big book on Wednesday, and I really resonated with what she had shared.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1768076945.0, "id": "nyuinah", "author": "bagotrauma"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "Day 17 checking in\nMy favorite form of self care is almost verbatim what was listed here lol\n\nSleep is HUGE!  I knew I was always tired but I didn’t realize that I DON’T actually have an internal alarm clock that wakes me up at 0400, “ready” to start the day.  Turns out, my body was starting to sober up and woke me up to demand more alcohol.  After only 2 1/2 weeks, I go to bed and fall asleep on my own and sleep (mostly) through the night for a solid 7-9 hours.  It’s a whole ‘nother level!\nPhysical activity:  I lied to myself and said I was prioritizing my family by procrastinating on “me” things (yoga, a quiet cup of coffee, a walk) by saying “well, I need to make them breakfast, I need to pack lunches, I can have a quick seltzer so I feel normal and can be on top of things for them” until I suddenly was out of time for me.  Turns out, I am far less stressed/anxious and my fuse is 10x longer simply because I take an hour for myself in the mornings before everyone wakes up to check in here with a hot coffee while everyone is asleep and do 30 minutes of yoga before starting anything else.  The dog is happier with less anxious energy too because we’re doing twice daily walks (short AM one long PM one).  I realized that my “selflessness” was instead just selfishness and hiding my addiction.  Let me tell you, that was a humbling moment.\nReading:  I LOVE reading.  Physical books, specifically.  I had forgotten how it feels to have a book in my hand and turn the actual pages.  I’m enjoying it again.\n\nThis weekend, hubby’s BFF’s girlfriend told me this week that she wants to get into a sober activity with me and wants to start working towards not drinking as much/stretching more so she is coming over tomorrow morning to do her first yoga session with me and we are going to go for a walk after up to town to grab a coffee or tea at a local coffee shop.  Then brunch with friends at the bar where I work.  I’m excited for shrimp and grits and a virgin Bloody Mary (the mix we have at work is the best and I don’t even miss the vodka).  If shots are ordered, I will be having pickle juice.\n\nI feel inspired today.

I’m not going to preach about the program, there’s other pages for that. But I try and make sure to sandwich my weekends with recovery related events.

I have a group of sober friends that get together Sunday evenings for a potluck. It’s a great hang and it keeps my cup full. \nBy ending my week with recovery and starting it with recovery it keeps me on solid ground. I sprinkle other things in through the week.

What finally made me quit is that I decided I wanted to be more present in my life. I saw people talking all the time about how quitting increased their performance at work, improved their mood, reduced anxiety/depression, and decreased temper issues. The withdrawal wasn’t so bad, and I’ve done that before, but the cravings are so impossible right now. All I think about from the time I get off work until the time I go to bed is going out to buy beer. It’s so hard, and it feels like I’m not seeing all this positive change that I thought I would. \n\nI’ve always had issues with anxiety, long before ever drinking, and drinking was that thing that really made me feel in control of my anxiety and depression. Now, my anxiety just builds all day and paralyzes me in the evening. I’m scared I’ll crack and drink again, wasting all my hard work. I’m anxious about going out, because all my relationships outside of work involved alcohol in some way. I’m scared of letting down my friends and family, because after I’ve opens up about my struggles I’ll seem like a failure if I relapse. \n\nMy work doesn’t seem to be improving, and actually it feels like I can’t let go of my stress at the end of the day. I lose sleep, tossing and turning, thinking about work and what I need to do. I feel exhausted during the day, and have trouble even keeping my eyes open during my plan period (I’m a teacher). \n\nI’ve taken antidepressants for years, before drinking, and have taken them consistently while drinking. (Effexor/venlafaxine. I know it’s bad. I told myself it would be fine because I took it in the morning and only drank at night). I haven’t felt truly depressed in years, but now it seems like those feelings are coming back. Did I ruin my tolerance to the meds? Will I just get worse?\n\nIs it just the addiction talking? Do I just have to wait it out? Why does it seem like everyone else hits a few weeks of sobriety and their life just immediately changes for the better, but mine is basically the same if not worse? \n\nTLDR: My life doesn’t feel any better after quitting, is it something wrong or just the addiction messing with my head?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1768004446.0, "id": "1q8p5fo", "author": "starmiss", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8p5fo/feeling_trapped_when_do_all_these_benefits_kick_in/"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "Everyone's experience is different.  For me, things started easing up after day 6, but I've read plenty of posts from people such as yourself who still have strong cravings 3 weeks in.  I'm sorry you are experiencing it.\n\nThe honest truth is that, yes, you have to give it more time.  If you think logically about it, if you were drinking heavily for over a year, does it seem reasonable to expect your brain and body to repair all the damage, and build new neural pathways, and reward circuits, in 20 days?  \n\nYou can do a Google search for \"supplements for alcohol withdrawals\" to see what may be helpful for your situation (stress, etc.).  If you are experiencing physical stress, such as clinched jaw, or have some common withdrawal symptoms such as shaky hands or wake up in the middle of the night with muscle aches in your legs, Magnesium Glycinate can help with that.  For racing thoughts and mental anxiety, rumination, etc. L-Theanine helps quiet the mind.  It isn't a sedative so it doesn't knock you out or leave you feeling groggy, it just dials down the volume in your head.  Apigenin, which is found in chamomile tea (or can be had in a powder pill form) acts on your GABA receptors and can help you relax while also promoting better sleep quality.  Finally, tart cherry juice (the juice itself is high in sugar, which could harm your sleep, but the pill form is sugar free) increases your natural melatonin production which helps with sleep.\n\nHope you feel better soon!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768021267.0, "id": "nyqi3zd", "author": "General-Buy-5543"}

I don't know if I would ever say that I ever was an alcoholic, the label isnt really important, but a short backstory before I go on;   \n  \nAbout a month ago I messed up, again. I go to university, and I used to go out with my friends and have fun drinking. I had a habit of going a bit too overboard, my upbringing wasnt easy and I never really had a social life until recently where I could learn my limits with drinking. I've never been used to going out drinking, and I believe that this is a big reason why I keep messing up maybe? This entire situation lead to my friends being put in a unfortunate situation of needing to help me get home, which is emberrasing for both parties. Its happened a couple of times, and this lead to them giving me the silent treatment after the last time. This really hit my mental hard, as I have trauma related to that (which they knew), and they used it to teach me a lesson, leaving me spiraling mentally to a really dark place for a couple of days. We made up though, I understand their perspective, but im also not happy with how they went about dealing with the situation in hindsight.\n\nThis brings me to the topic at hand too, tomorrow they're going out, they want me to come with, but sober. I already went out with them once after that ordeal sober, which was not a problem, but it was unbelievably boring to me. I feel like they already labeled me, and they are removing my autonomy and not giving me a chance to prove that ive learnt my lesson. It makes me really sad, because i feel like im missing out on a very important part of being in uni, which is socializing. I do socialize when im sober too, but I feel like going out with them with a few drinks is important, and im scared that if I just don't drink with them that they will eventually just disappear from my life and I'll go back to being alone again like I was for many years.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "I had 58 days sober and my wife came out to me. Today is day 59. AMA.", "text": "My entire life shifted under me 24 hours ago and somehow I'm still sober. I'm hoping that somewhere in this thread I'll start to have an inkling how that's happened.\n\nI've been a daily drinker for the last fifteen years, but the last six have been particularly hard. My wife and I took pay cuts to move 200 miles away to a place we thought we could afford to build a better life for ourselves - five weeks later the pandemic lockdowns started. I started drinking more. We managed to buy a home in 2021 and six months later, my wife lost her mother to cancer. She lost her aunt to the same six months after that. I started drinking more.  A miscarriage in 2022, followed by the realization that we were never going to be parents. I started drinking more.\n\nShe had been out as bisexual for a few years by then and after so much pain I was determined to try and bring more joy into her life, to do anything I could so that she could be more fully herself. We tried polyamory. We tried ethical non-monogamy. She met a woman she fell head over heels for and nine months later, she broke things off completely because of the lies she'd been told and how poorly I'd been treated. I was drinking much, much more by then. I remember how much of that summer I spent alone in our home, wondering what had happened to us. I remember how large a queen size bed felt when I was sleeping alone. I don't remember too much else.\n\nAfterwards we tried therapy, we tried couples therapy, and we tried couples therapy again. By this point I was going through a handle of 100 proof bourbon every 48 hours and I genuinely believed that since I could stop for a day or three or five and tend to whatever business I needed to it wasn't really a problem. She prefers cannabis, I prefer liquor, nobody's judging anybody and as long as everything's fine, then everything's fine.\n\n58 days ago, she asked me to stop. Not for a week, not for two, but to *stop.* Ninety days, at least, and then see where my head was at. She told me that it felt like I loved drinking more than I loved her, that she could not stand to see me making myself so small, that as confused as she was about everything that's happened she couldn't find a way to desire me when I was so dedicated to dulling my senses, that whatever we were going through could not possibly be helped by incrementally poisoning myself.\n\nShe said that it was only because she knew what kind of man I was and could be that she was having this conversation with me instead of a lawyer.\n\nThat one sentence sobered my simple ass up right quick. Everything out of the house that night, cold turkey then and there. Yes, I know, that's *very* stupid, but in my defense, so am I.\n\nI've been lucky so far in that regard. No physical withdrawal symptoms, no sleep disturbance, no mood swings, no anxiety spikes. My bloodwork shows no abnormalities at all. My therapist told me a few days ago that she's been doing substance abuse recovery work since the mid nineties and she's absolutely certain I don't have an alcohol problem (which is a whole different story that I'm not sure would be helpful here - I'll say that there came a time that I decided to become a functional alcoholic and we'll leave it at that. Like I said earlier, *very* stupid, but so am I!)\n\nI was starting to feel like I'd actually gotten away with it. That I didn't have to hit rock bottom, that my life didn't need to be rebuilt from the ground up at the age of 41. Okay, yeah, my job is absolutely ending on 4/30 and yeah, there's no relevant work where I live and yeah, the amount of debt we're carrying could crush us at any moment, but you know what? I got sober on COMMAND, my guys! I have the constitution of an ox and I can probably leap tall buildings in a single bound if I really tried hard, am I right? Willpower and discipline and the impossibly loving support of my wife, who -\n\nIs gay.\n\nYes, she's sure. No, nothing was faked. Nothing was forced. She wishes it wasn't the case. She's sure. She loves me. She's always loved me. She wishes more than anything that the person who helped her build a life where she could finally be who she is wasn't the one this will hurt to the core. Yes, she's sure.\n\nShe doesn't want to leave. She doesn't want a divorce. She loves me and she's proud of what I've done and she's proud of what we've built and she's sure. She swears that one day she's going to be the best wingman anybody ever had, she's going to make sure every woman I ever look at twice knows what she'd be passing up and she is god-damn *sure.*\n\nEverything I've done for the last decade of my life I've done so that one day she could feel safe enough to be all of who she is, whatever that might mean. I gave my word, and while I never dreamt that this might be what it takes to keep it, well, that's really too bad, because I gave my fucking word. When and if there comes a day there's a woman she wants to marry instead, I will send my fifty dollars to the universal life church and I will perform that ceremony myself and I will never do anything harder than that because even through a drunken haze a decade long I delivered what I promised and she is absolutely, positively sure.\n\nAnd that brings me, somehow, to day 59. I've read this back over twice and I don't see what could've been different any more than I see how I'm going to make it to day 60. But there's not a drop of alcohol in the house, I'm making another cup of tea, and if I can stand to sit in the ash and dust of my life for another handful of hours, I'll get to do the very same thing tomorrow. And the day after that, and the day after *that...*\n\nMaybe it's a stupid way to look at things but, well, y'know.\n\nAMA.\n\n===============================================\n\nEDIT 1.10.2026, 12:43PM EST:\n\nI am decidedly and dramatically unprepared for the response this thing has gotten, y'all, god-DAMN. I don't know how to appropriately return the support I've gotten here today. Thank each and every one of you, truly.\n\nGiven the visibility this has right now, there's one thing in particular I feel compelled to make very clear: in *absolutely no way* does this constitute a lie or a betrayal of any kind on the part of my wife as far as I'm concerned. I have said yes to *every single step* that led us to today. In fact, I've been the one to push us onward on occasion when she was afraid of what all of this could mean for us.\n\nWhen she first came out to me, I gave her my word that if there ever came a time she felt she needed to explore herself in this fashion, she would do so with my knowledge and consent, whatever that might mean. I told her that I couldn't bring myself to ask her to keep herself small or stunted or in any way less than the fullness of who she is just because she happened to be marrying a man. And when we were married, we wrote our own vows and I swore that I would always lift her towards the light, whatever that might cost.\n\nI very deliberately did not say a single word about fidelity.\n\nThe first sentence she ever said to me was \"Fuck you, you're wrong.\" I love that this is how she introduced herself into my life just as much as I love her. That energy has propelled us forward at times I couldn't have seen a way through on my own. That energy inspired this post just like it has 60 days of sobriety. And if one day still to come we should crash and burn despite our lofty dreams and best intentions, well, hey.\n\nFuck me, I was wrong!", "score": 1444, "num_comments": 134, "created_utc": 1768002067.0, "id": "1q8o81s", "author": "an_irrelevant_life", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8o81s/i_had_58_days_sober_and_my_wife_came_out_to_me/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "I appreciate the comment. Seeing the response my post has generated this morning (which I am extremely unprepared for!) does make it important for me to clarify something regarding your second point - these are decisions we're making together, implausible as that might sound. Implausible as I'm sure it's going to feel some days, if I'm gonna keep being honest.\n\nThese are issues she and I have talked...around, I think, over the past couple of years. Neither one of us was really ready to face it before, but she has admittedly had more time and space in which to process all our possibilities than I have. Part of that it because the question of her sexuality is hers and hers alone to answer, and another part of that is that I chose to hide from the realities of our lives thus far in the bottom of a bottle for as long as I could. But at 60 days sober I'm just as sure I want her to stay as she is that she's going to.\n\nAs far as grieving what was lost and what will never come to pass? The original post is a critical part of that process for me, as are my responses today. I can't and won't pretend that this isn't one of the most painful and shattering experiences of my life, but I also can't pretend that I am in any way a victim here.\n\nI *insisted* on opening this door for her. I cannot in good conscience conceive of slamming it behind her because she trusted me enough to walk through it.\n\nI can't say with any surety that we will in fact remain married until question marks, or that I'll never hurt so much or grow in so different a direction that physical and legal space won't become necessary for us both. I can say that she is to this day the best and truest friend I've ever had in my life, that our lifestyles and outlooks and senses of humor are compatible and complementary in ways I did not believe possible before I met her.\n\nSo far we both think that's enough to build on until it isn't.", "score": 18, "created_utc": 1768063013.0, "id": "nyt63ae", "author": "an_irrelevant_life"}

I'm *really* not. \n\n(Although on the flip side of that argument, whatever mythical woman *would* like to meet the gay wife guy is probably somebody I'd be very interested in talking to.

I'm 41 now and by the time our living situation isn't so completely dictated by our debt burden, I'll be at least 45. How many more years, exactly, do I believe my sexual appetite is going to be such a driving force in my life? How many more years do I *want* it to be such a primary concern?

It's hard to see the forest for the trees these days, but you've given me an invaluable moment to zoom out and see the question I'm actually trying to answer.\n\nIt's not who will make me feel desired and wanted tomorrow or the day after that.\n\nIt's who do I want to grow old with?\n\nAnd the answer to *that* isn't going to change.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me see that clearly.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768089896.0, "id": "nyvp2ld", "author": "an_irrelevant_life"}

Philosophy has long been an interest of mine, as a matter of fact, and while it's been some years since I pursued it even semi-seriously I find myself returning to Foucault these last few days. From an interview he gave in '81 on \"Friendship as a Way of Life\" (emphasis in italics is mine):\n\n\"One of the concessions one makes to others is not to present homosexuality as anything but a kind of immediate pleasure...There you have a kind of neat image of homosexuality without any possibility of generating unease, and for two reasons: it responds to a reassuring canon of beauty, and *it cancels everything that can be troubling in affection, tenderness, friendship, fidelity, camaraderie, and companionship, things that our rather sanitized society can't allow a place for without fearing the formation of new alliances and the tying together of unforeseen lines of force.*\n\nI think that's what makes homosexuality 'disturbing': the homosexual mode of life, much more than the sexual act itself. To imagine a sexual act that doesn't conform to law or nature is not what disturbs people. *But that individuals are beginning to love one another - there's the problem.* The institution \\[of marriage\\] is caught in a contradiction; affective intensities traverse it which at one and the same time keep it going and shake it up. Look at the army, where love between men is ceaselessly provoked and shamed. *Institutional codes can't validate these relations with multiple intensities, variable colors, imperceptible movements and changing forms. These relations short-circuit it and introduce love where there's supposed to be only law, rule or habit.\"*\n\nTomorrow may well bring me something completely different, but this certainly rings true for me today.", "score": 0, "created_utc": 1768058598.0, "id": "nysr010", "author": "an_irrelevant_life"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "4 weeks", "text": "It's been 28 days since I had my last drink, it was a full blown alcohol induced blackout, here are the changes I noticed\n\nSleep in the first 3 days were absolute torture, I could probably sleep 4 hours daily and go the rest of the day like a zombie and at night roll around in bed until barely fall asleep at almost daylight for another 4 hours and repeat. Now almost a month later I could fall asleep somewhat normally again, although my body clock is still messed up, and I still have trouble sleep pass 7 hours a day.\n\nBrain fog in the first 3 weeks were so bad I basically lost my capacity to think or initiate any social interaction. Sure I could engage in a conversation but there was always a wall in my head that blocked me, and is still blocking me albeit lesser so to come up with new topics for conversations and new ideas, for me to be the one who initiates rather than passively responding. Now it improved slightly but I still have trouble puting my idea into words even if I could form them in my head.\n\nNo energy: I feel more energized and clearheaded in the morning when I first got up, but that little energy is quickly drained around 2pm, I would be so tired with a foggy mind for the rest of the day and lose all capability to think and just want to get the day over with and go to bed. 4 weeks in I can stay sharp for a little longer, maybe to around 3-4pm, then fatigue and brain fog again.\n\nHeadache has gotten slightly better, I drank plenty of water but it doesn't seem to help, for the first 2 weeks the headache felt like something was pinching my brain from within, paired with the constant brain fog even reading became a luxury. Now I still have headaches daily but it became slightly more tolerable. Since water doesn't seem to help I think I can only ride this out with time.\n\nFor more than half of the nights since I gone sober I was plagued by some kind of bad dreams, sometimes it's straight up nightmare being chased by demons that looked as if it came straight out of a Lovecraftian book, sometimes by humanoid figures that looked human but there are something terrifyingly creepy about them, I could fly in those dreams but those entities always flied faster than me even at full speed like they were toying with me, it was sheer horror and desperation; other dreams were eerie but not quite terrifying, most of them were fragmented, with little pieces here and there so I couldn't quite piece together what I just dreamed, but one thing I do remember they were all in realms without sunlight, some were grey and some looked like dark forests, some in abandoned schools that were suddenly filled with people... like I wouldn't be surprised if you tell me I've been briefly pulled into the afterlife in those dreams. But regardless dreams of demons or some grey purgatory, the common theme all these dreams had was hopelessness, I'm stuck there for eternity with no way out.\n\nBut even I'm going through these problems, headaches, brain fogs, insomnia ,dreams of demonic worlds, I have faith that it will all pass. I've been drinking heavily for over 4 years, the damage has been done and the healing will take much longer than a month I'm sure. So I made the bed and now I have to sleep in it.\n\nI'll probably make an update in another post that's more coherent once I'm in a better mental state, right now the brain fog hasn't completely lifted yet which you could surely see from my writings of my poor mental performance.", "score": 9, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767998708.0, "id": "1q8mux6", "author": "efthegreat", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8mux6/4_weeks/"}

I’m honestly ashamed of it.\n\nI feel like I’ll never get out of it and that it’s a vicious circle.\n\nIf you have any tips to help me, I’ll take them—I’m clearly desperate…\n\nPlease don’t judge me. I know what I’m doing is bad. But I was still a minor when I fell into it, and it’s been following me ever since.\n\nThat’s why I’m asking for advice.

I would read some of the stories on here and think \"wow i'm glad I never let it get that bad\".\n\n  \nI decided I actually don't care if I have a problem yet or not, because regardless of the current answer, I know that I was on a path to a problem eventually.

I dumped out almost $200 of whiskey knowing I would fold eventually if I kept it.\n\nLast night my daughter asked me at 8:00pm if we could run to the store for something she needed for school.  If this had been the week before, I would have been at least 4 drinks deep by that time. I would have gotten frustrated and told her it was too late, that she should have thought of it earlier, or perhaps doordashed it to our house paying an insane fee for the privilege.  Instead, sober me smiled and grabbed my keys and said \"Let's get ice cream on the way\".\n\nLater that night, she came into my room at 2am to tell me she was having trouble sleeping because she was sad about being teased at school.

Instead, sober me got up and sat with her for 30 minutes, talking about what happened, reassuring and loving her, and putting together a plan for how we'll handle the situation.\n\nWhen we finally finished, she hugged me for much longer than our normal hug, and said \"Thank you Dad\" and turned over.  When I checked on her 10 minutes later she was dead asleep.\n\nI'm so thankful for that opportunity I would have never had if I were still drinking.

God knows what I did or said in the hours I was at the event blacked out. I don’t even want to know.\n\nI’ve been aware I have a problem since I started drinking at 18. But this was genuinely rock bottom. Especially because it was so hard to find this job after being laid off earlier this year. Before, I’d been able to keep my work and drinking separate (excluding being constantly hungover at work or calling out sick due to hangovers) and this felt like a new line I crossed that I don’t know how to come back from.\n\nI wasn’t fired or anything, but everyone certainly has a different opinion of me now vs before and it’s palpable. I made an excuse about being on a new medication but not sure if anyone actually bought it. Seem to be generally on thin ice with everyone.\n\nI am 100% committed to sobriety. Waking up that next morning, I knew that there were only 2 options - get sober or end my life. because I knew if I kept drinking this wouldn’t be the last time I’d have to feel such unbearable shame (have had endless embarrassing incidents in the past in a variety of situations). So I knew I had to get sober if I didnt want to break my family’s hearts by ending my life altogether.\n\nI do feel much better and the main thing that’s making me hopeful is knowing I never have to put myself in any kind of compromising situation or be out of control of my behavior ever again. Also not to brag (but also to brag) I look amazing (clear skin finally, -5 lbs, in case anyone needs any extra motivation, LOL!)\n\nI feel generally positive about my life moving forward and believe in myself to stick with this and do what’s actually best for my mental health and wellbeing. This wasn’t my first hospitalization due to alcohol… and I’m only 24. It was just the first one at work 😭\n\nThe issue is having to be at this job everyday in a confined office space, around coworkers who’ve seen me at my absolute worst. My boss seems to have moved past it and we have a positive relationship. But I hate that I can’t scream to everyone “I know I had a problem, but I’m sober now, I’m better now, I’m not that embarrassing version of myself” but that’s obviously not appropriate or necessary. I just wish they didn’t think I was still walking around as that sad broken out of control  version of myself.\n\nI know as time passes people forget and move on, but it’s a terrible reminder coming in every day that all of these people were there for my rock bottom without any context as to my struggles or level of self-awareness. I’m scared they just see me as a young blonde party girl who doesn’t know her limits or take her work seriously or care about the repercussions of her actions. I know that’s not me- I do care, and I care a lot. I care about others, being kind, showing up in a positive way in the world. I just wasn’t always able to do those things because I’ve been captured by this disease my entire adult life.\n\nIt never felt like I was actively making bad choices, but rather like I was simply reacting to impulses that I had to drink excessively in order to cope with life. It felt like there was no other way.\n\nI know now that I do have a choice, but I just wish everyone knew my entire struggle and how deeply I regret and feel shame about this incident. I know that’s not how life works and as they say perception is reality. I guess that just makes me feel uneasy and upset. I hate the feeling of being misunderstood. Not to mention, beyond this incident, there are hundreds of other people walking around the world who have some other terrible image/memory of who I am that isn’t the real me. And it’s just frustrating. I’m sure many of us feel this way.\n\nI guess I don’t have a question. Just needed to share this with someone. Have really appreciated this community over my past 35 days of sobriety. Thank you!!!\n\n\\*\\* edit, realized I’m actually now technically in my mid-20s, LOL. how time flies.", "score": 95, "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1767993389.0, "id": "1q8kl8v", "author": "Bulky-Confusion-5917", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8kl8v/constantly_reminded_of_my_rock_bottom/"}

The first 30 came off in the first year and the rest this year. I also have a history of bulimia and BED and getting sober also meant working on the same root issues that fueled those behaviors, plus I started Effexor and I think it just helped a lot with the constant drinking/food noise I’ve struggled with. At my highest I was 200-210lbs, and it’s just kind of always been in my head that i was meant to be overweight and my bad body image and drinking were just a self-destructive cycle. I was easily doing 1.5-2 bottles of wine a night and the calories and sugar alone make me pause now, to say nothing of the food I was drunk eating and not understanding why I was so overweight. \n\nI did also start walking a lot more and hiking and lifting weights, but that’s all fairly casual. I really think it’s just been a slow rewiring of my brain to not impulsively sooth myself with my two weapons of choice. the amount of chronic pain that has lessened or gone away has been incredible, as someone who has always been heavy, and while it’s not my main reason to chose sobriety every day, it definitely has been a huge one.

To them, all they know is what we say, and it’s easy to doubt, if we have said it before. \n\nTime will tell and if you keep your head up and stay sober, it will show. If you give in to drinking, she will just think she was right all along. \n\nThere are lots of reasons not to drink, but if you need a reason now, spite will work.

In my mid 20’s I overcame a serious addiction to prescription painkillers. Until COVID I was a fairly moderate drinker, maybe somewhat of a binge drinker. The last 6 years I’ve seen myself devolve into undeniable alcoholism. Hanging at my local dive bar 5-6 days a week. Drinking every night. Feeling like shit at work every day. I couldn’t make it more than 2 days without drinking. Constantly anxious, high BP, stomach issues, body getting soft (I’ve always been lean and athletic), my body was just telling me it was time. I went on a big bender in early December and just decided enough was enough. 3 days before my birthday I decided I was done. Today I’m 31 days sober. Been feeling all of the highs and lows that come with early sobriety as expected. The holidays, my birthday, new years, and two deaths in my family in that timespan were all huge challenges that made me consider drinking, but I made it through without.. I work in the trades, and have been laid off for the last 2 months, which gave me plenty of fuel to feed into my alcoholism. Unemployment has barely been covering basic expenses, and finances have been a huge stessor. I didn’t know how I was going to continue paying for school that started this week. I’m 3/4 years in to an apprenticeship, and without school - I’m out of my line of work completely.

Touch- get under a blanket warmer, walk in the heat of the sun, put your feet in cold water, pet your dog or cat or partner, hot or cold shower. 3.Sight- go to book store or library (for extra sensory wear your earbuds, bring your hot or cold coffee/drink). Look at beautiful pictures, read, take a drive, hike somewhere beautiful or interesting\n4. Smell- go to a candle store, trip to beach to smell sea air, spray perfume/cologne on you 5.

I dreamt I got wasted and destroyed a house, leaving her in harms way. I dreamt that my brother and sister-in-law called my family, and confronted me. I heard there voices speaking clearly. They told me I would not be allowed around her anymore. That I wasn’t good for her and had to go. It was horrible. \n\nI woke up crying; my roommate woke up too and checked on me because she heard it. It took me 15 minutes but I realized:\n\nI spent Christmas with my family and I was the only person my niece wanted besides her own mom. She followed me everywhere, screamed my name when I came in the room and wouldn’t go to bed until I came back to the house after a detour. I pushed her around in her new baby stroller, which came with a baby doll that she promptly threw away in declaration that SHE was the baby, for hours. We watched Bluely. We played with her new little kitchen all Christmas Day. My brother and sister-in-law left her with me multiple times and thanked me profusely for being the only one that was engaging her like that so they could take a break. When my sister-in-law left to go get the dog from boarding and the baby was upset, I put on a show in her room for her, where I met every stuffed animal in the room. My brother said, “I’ve heard of Ms. Rachel, but have you heard of Ms. Snootbooper? She’s as engrossed in what you’re doing as she would be to that”.  Everyone wants to touch her because she’s the only baby, but I keep playing it cool, and eventually, my sister-in-law said, “go take a picture with SnootBooper!”, and she ran into my lap. After that, she sat on my lap on the couch multiple times, running to her mom then back to me. I carried her around the restaurant at dinner. \n\nAfter Christmas, everyone was talking about it. How good I was with her. How much she’s taken to me.\n\nThat little girl has never seen me drunk. She’s starting to speak and has been trying to say my name. I was so, so proud. Everyone was happy. I bought a huge box of presents because money was tight for my mom. I spent months finding the perfect things. I said they were all from Santa but they all knew it was me. I cooked. I got up early. I had to; the baby wanted me. I found my mom’s lost wedding ring, avoiding complete disaster. I helped her walk as she’s been ill.\n\nShe went to the hospital last night; one where I used to frequent. I walked in and said “hey mom, isn’t this great?! We’re here and it’s not because of ME!” And she belly laughed. I stayed for four hours, and I’m going back after work today.\n\nI had 14 months yesterday. I will not drink with you today.

How ghostly? Let me paint you a picture:\n\n- **Athletic Run Wild IPA vs Guinness 0**: 1-0. ONE VOTE. A single solitary soul showed up to cast a ballot for Run Wild, and Guinness 0 - the Irish stout that DEMOLISHED Athletic Free Wave 18-9 last round - received exactly ZERO votes. The marquee matchup we were all hyped for was decided by a coin flip disguised as democracy.\n\n- **Athletic Upside Dawn vs Sierra Nevada Trail Pass**: 0-0. Nobody. Not a single person. The bracket system presumably flipped a coin (Upside Dawn advances).\n\n- **Lagunitas IPNA vs BrewDog Punk AF**: 0-0. Tumbleweeds. Absolute silence. (Lagunitas advances by... existing first alphabetically? Bracket magic? Who knows.)\n\n- **Brooklyn Special Effects vs Deschutes Black Butte Porter**: 0-0. The dark beer showdown that could have been legendary... decided by the void. (Brooklyn advances.)\n\nSo after all that Round 1 and Round 2 drama, the Elite Eight was essentially auto-assigned. The bracket marches on, but the people have spoken by not speaking at all.\n\n## Semi-Finals Preview: AN ALL-ATHLETIC SHOWDOWN?!\n\nDespite the voter drought, the bracket has delivered something remarkable: **ATHLETIC BREWING VS ATHLETIC BREWING** in the first semi-final! **Run Wild IPA faces Upside Dawn Golden** - the flagship hop bomb against the crushable golden ale. It's sibling rivalry at its finest, and one Athletic beer WILL fall.\n\nThe other semi-final is **Lagunitas IPNA vs Brooklyn Special Effects IPA** - two American craft IPAs battling for a spot in the finals. West Coast hop philosophy meets East Coast brewing pride.\n\n**Can we get some actual votes this round?** I'm not asking for much. Just... more than one. Please. The beers deserve better.\n\n**[Vote in the Semi-Finals!](https://www.polltab.com/bracket-poll/xTlOSNtMHcutB)**\n\nIWNDWYT, and may the best brew win (with actual human votes this time)!", "score": 7, "num_comments": 22, "created_utc": 1767974897.0, "id": "1q8capk", "author": "soberingthought", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8capk/straw_poll_saturday_for_january_10_2026/"}

It was that way when I started at age 15 up until I finally managed to stop. I'm powerless over the effects alcohol has on my body and mind. It kicks my ass every time I drink that first drink. Eventually a mental obsession develops and my life becomes increasingly unmanageable. Everything begins to suffer: relationships, health, finances, work, sanity etc.  Just the way it is. My lot in life when it comes to alcohol. Not everyone is like this. In fact, the majority of people out there aren't alcoholic. I am.\n\nThese acceptances are key. Knowing I'm alcoholic, I'm left with two questions: which me? Which world? If I drink that first drink I get drunken ol' me in drunken ol' world with all of its drunken probable futures every time. If I avoid that first drink at all costs, my life is something entirely different. Actions are very powerful in this way. They determine the course of our lives.\n\nI wish you well.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767975303.0, "id": "nyma6ii", "author": "Yell-Oh-Fleur"}
