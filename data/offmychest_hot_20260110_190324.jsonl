We do not allow solicitation or material offers.\n\nThis means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.\n\nThis community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.\n\nThere are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.\n\nThank you for your cooperation.", "score": 1234, "num_comments": 73, "created_utc": 1649991613.0, "id": "u3ydaq", "author": "AutoModerator", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/u3ydaq/we_have_persistent_scammers_preying_on_this/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "Its wild to see each of these getting checked \n\n10 tactics of fascism by Jason Stanley \n\nThe mythic past. Fascists promote a glorified mythical past to make people dissatisfied with the present. The past is painted as a time of greatness. That greatness was based on a strong military and the fact that the dominant racial group ruled over the others. Fascists claim that the “leftists and communists” have “taken your greatness from you.”\n\nPropaganda. Fascists lie and manipulate language in order to rewrite the shared reality of the population. Fascist propaganda is based around naming “friends” and “enemies.” The political opponent is declared to be a merciless threat to the nation.\nAnti-intellectualism. Fascists attack universities and educational systems because they could potentially teach people to challenge fascist ideas. The fascist leader sets the rules about what is true or false. Expertise, even reality, is a threat to the authority of the leader.\n\nUnreality. Freedom and political equality require truth. Fascist voices work deliberately to create a state of unreality. Its adherents lose the ability to recognize truth. Reasoned discussion and debate is replaced with conspiracy theories and lies.\n\nHierarchy. Fascists create a hierarchy of human worth. They promote social divisions and harden social rankings over such things as race, religion, and gender. Once the hierarchies are in place, people are controlled by being kept nervous and frightened about the possibility of losing their place in the hierarchy.\n\nVictim-hood. Once people come to believe that they are higher than another group in the hierarchy, any move toward equality by lower groups is used to stoke feelings of resentment and victim-hood among the dominant population. Equality becomes, not a goal, but a threat.\n\nLaw and Order. “Law and Order” politics is used to cast “them” as dangerous, lawless, criminals and to justify brutal crackdowns on minorities or people who are out of favor. Minority groups are considered “law-abiding” only as long as they accept their subservient role. At the same time, however, the fascist leader is not bound by any law.\n\nSexual Anxiety. A fascist hierarchy is rigidly patriarchal and is threatened by gender equity. Hence, they impose strict control and dominance over women. They also promote paranoia about homosexuality.\n\nSodom and Gomorrah. Fascist movements typically emphasize an urban/rural divide. The cities are portrayed as decadent criminal centers full of enemy “elites” and immigrants. City dwellers don’t even do “real” work (with their hands) like rural folks do.\n\nArbeit macht frei. (Work shall make you free). This slogan was written on the gates of Auschwitz. Fascists claim that the minority group and the leftists are lazy by nature and must be made to work (hence, concentration camps and forced labor camps). Labor unions are said to be run by communists – so unions must be crushed. Since hard work (by the underclasses) is the primary virtue, fascists ultimately decide that the disabled have no value and devise ways to get rid of them.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768044058.0, "id": "nyrq1mb", "author": "larryjeuness"}

Moisturize the area after showering with a light simple moisturizer (I use cetaphil). The safest thing would be using a loofah or washcloth since the exfoliant does have actives in it, but this is the routine that works for me. Even if you’re not shaving, I think exfoliating regularly would make a difference! Give your hair time to grow out a little between shaves.\n\nI also ended up doing a few rounds of laser hair removal in my early twenties to thin my hair out. I didn’t keep going until bald and haven’t gone back for the recommended maintenance. This also made a huge difference since the bikini line was the problem area for me. This is obviously a more expensive route, but it was completely worth it in my opinion if you are able to budget for it.\n\nAs others mentioned, going to a derm would be the best way to approach this!

So if you worry about blood you can just put a disc/cup/small tampon in there so youll be sure there will be no blood, and you'll still get wet.

A glass a day keeps the stank away. \n- ginger and turmeric orange shots - again, once a day. I started getting irregular periods and this stuff is what I credit to sorting that out. When I’m not having it regularly I’m irregular \n- probiotic yoghurt once a day. I have actimel. Keeps your bacteria healthy. \n- vaginal pessaries clean out your punani while balancing your pH. I’m so dysfunctional down there that I have to use two over two days after my period to reset the balance. \n- I have noticed that keeping clean shaven stops the abscesses - I used to get them on my labia. Very gross but it’s to do with glands getting gunked up. Sounds like you’re having to use liners every day which will cause irritation and pubes sadly trap more gunk that way (rather than their intended purpose to protect you from it). I still occasionally get them but it’s way less than before now. \n- shave ur ass girl. Dirt, sweat etc can make its way up if the hair is long enough to spread it around. Sadly we no longer live the same lives our caveman family did and we are constricted to pants. \n- cotton underwear also reduces sweat/moisture/bacteria from getting trapped. Go commando at night!! Let her BREATHE!\n- moon cups may allow you to be rid of the liners too. You can get small ones for spotting. \n- coming off birth control actually helped me, but I know everyone is different. If coming off is not an option perhaps you could try another one? I’m much better without any. \n- for your ingrown hair, after shaving, scrub yourself with a loofa or African sponge. Stops all that. (ETA: exfoliation prevents ingrown hair all over the body regardless of shaving so I suggest this regardless of the choice you make!)\n- apple cider vinegar baths. Just a little bit in your bath gently cleans you and keeps your pH balance. \n\nReading the Woman Code (can’t remember the author, it’s a pink/purple book) really helped me understand what my body needs and gave me much of this advice/helped me figure out my unique code. Also… please do not feel crap about how your labia look. They are as unique as hands are. Saying they look ‘gross’ is not fair to yourself and you shouldn’t feel bad.

Some cysts need to be handled by a dermatologist cutting them out completely, or they just keep growing back. It’s worth getting real medical care for. \n\nI get the whole spotting issue (same everyday pantyliner deal here). If I were aiming for receiving oral I’d just shower immediately beforehand. Cuts back on spontaneity, but sex is better when you feel clean starting out anyway. Somehow I ended up with a partner who just doesn’t do eating out, I don’t really miss it much, and it keeps the microbiome down there safe to refrain (excessive saliva can raise your risk of yeast infections and BV). \n\nI promise your healthy vulva will be every bit as beautiful as anyone else’s!

It also helps women with PCOs which it seems you might have. It also made me less greasy in general too. \n\nI also recommend getting laser instead of shaving. It helps with irritation and bumps. It’s not that expensive. I didn’t do it for looks but for literally my sanity. I found a Groupon and paid $200 for 6 sessions. I did two sets of sessions and they were so so so worth it. They do the full vulva and the butt crack. You’ll need to do a full shave the day before but that’s it. Just the day before the laser. Eventually you won’t see much if any growing back\n\nIn terms of staying clean you need to take a minimum of one shower a day. Use dove bar soap. I use hypochlorous acid spray on my body when I get out of the shower\n\nIf you have a bit of an off smell you can also use boric acid suppositories for a few days to help freshen the area. Stop 24 hours before sex as it can irritate the penis. You could do this for a few days after a period to keep things fresh. \n\nAll of these are pretty basic and not overwhelming to keep up with but could really give you a sense of relief. \n\nThe biggest thing I recommend is reaching out to a doctor about Spironolactone.

BHA is antiinflammatory and helps minimize oil in pores without drying it out completely.\n\nFor abscesses: A product called My Magic Healer. It's a balm that is advertised specifically for this purpose -- abscesses in the groin, pits, under boob area. I spread a thin layer on the affected area every day.

Video, *especially* in this day and age, absolutely can be and is edited. A guy who believes that women should look like and behave like women in porn doesn’t have a solid grasp on reality. Porn is acting. It’s a job. Men and women alike don’t actually love everything portrayed in porn irl \n\nComparison is the thief of joy. I had hated my body forever bc I didn’t look like the supermodels that were popular in my teen years, only to look back and realize that I was beautiful and spent so much time hating things that were out of my control (different body types) for literally no reason. \n\nIt’s so much easier said than done, but *please* don’t think you need to conform to one dude’s concept of what’s hot. I swear to you that there are dudes who loooove all different body types. The one bf who watched porn with women who looked different than me, when I told him I felt bad about myself bc of it he told me that if that were the type of girl he wanted then he would go for that type of girl.

Makeup applied over areas to keep them looking smooth, butt implants, etc. I know it’s hard but I also see no reason to compare yourself to them. We see our insecurities and assume others do too and that not matching is an attack on us and that the insecurity must be real. That’s not the case and we allow ourselves to over think. Most guys aren’t going “oh I’m gonna watch this video cause the girls have no stretch marks” or “this girl has nice skin I’m gonna watch it” ya know. He saw the butt and clicked. \n\nI also watch it on occasion if my husband is traveling and I don’t think I’ve ever chosen someone because they’ve looked like my man. It genuinely has nothing to with that. I love my husband, he definitely turns me on. I wouldn’t change anything about him or his body. None of my history would match him per se. I’m not spending the time looking for his qualities, I’m just finding some random video I vibe with and go. There’s of course preferences but it’s not always a super in depth thing. Look at a few videos, pick the best, move on. \n\nI would talk to him though about your feelings and if you aren’t comfortable with porn this is a great time to bring it up. That conversation will be what’s important. Is he supportive and encouraging? That’s what’s matters. If it turns out for some reason he’s dating you but doesn’t like your body then screw that guy. You deserve better. Someone out there will love you for you as you are. Stretch marks aren’t ugly and they can’t always be helped. Don’t let that bring you down. It’s a very human and common thing.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "If my spiritual path of Vedanta has taught me anything, it's that there is a quiet and undisturbed peace inside you always. Suffering is merely a forgetting of your own nature, which is peace and happiness itself. Your happiness is not contingent on anything happening out there. The world could be crumbling around you, and you could still be happy. That sounds crazy until you come to fully realize that this is absolutely true. \n\nYes, it is easy to fall into the trap of suffering. It is part of our experience, but it is a necessary part nonetheless. \n\nI like to use the mental image of a painting. A painting is beautiful precisely because of its colors and shades. A purely white painting is simply a canvas. A purely black painting is a canvas. You cannot know pleasure *or* suffering without reference to its duality, to its opposite. \n\nBut enlightenment is the understanding that all dualities must collapse into unity in the presence of Brahman (God, or simply Awareness. It's you, but the real you, beneath the superficial layers of ego and identity. That is God.) Suffering is not something to be avoided, it's something to be embraced and integrated. Pleasure, suffering, it's all just *Experience*. The illumined eye sees no difference, and he is peaceful. \n\nUnderstanding all of this doesn't make things not hurt. It means you stop giving suffering unnecessary attention. Our thoughts are like amplifiers, and greatly affect the degree to which we suffer. Exercise control over your thoughts and emotions, and you will find that the grip of suffering on the mind loosens dramatically.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768018710.0, "id": "nyqbpe5", "author": "naeramarth2"}

But I just found out from my mum that her son (my cousin?) has been taken by social services. Which we all expected to be honest, it was very obvious he needed additional support (he’s 3). My daughter is a year older than him so my aunt was able to see what milestones her son is meant to be hitting but wasn’t, but still refused to get him that help, she didn’t take him to nursery because she got it in her head that the female teachers are just after her husband. Everyone’s saying her son is in a better place now, he’s getting all the support he needs, his parents are constantly fighting so he’s out of that toxic environment. I just feel so sad for him, he had the biggest injustice done by his mum not getting him help, he was neglected in a place he should’ve felt safe, and his now we have to hope he is placed with a good foster family.\n\nBtw, I had to cut her off. She had social services on her case and she reached out to me because she wanted me to lie to them and tell them that she’s been coming to play sessions with me, and that I take her son out (which I never did). I was happy to take him out, I offered many times but she wouldn’t agree, she just wanted me to lie. I even offered to have him at my house for a few days. I did tell her I’m happy to speak to them and tell them the truth. \n\nI don’t think I’ll see him again, but I hope he’s happy now.

She doesn't think she did anything wrong because she was unhappy and so was I. Regret? No, not the act itself but the unintended consequences that it caused. We sold the house and both moved to separate places. Now,, she needs to pay her own bills, cook her own meals, take care of our daughter, maintain her own house and everything that comes with it whereas I did a lot of that stuff while we were together. She doesn't regret cheating. She regrets all the extra stuff she has to do now. \n\n  \n\\&gt; Maybe one mistake is not worth losing someone and perhaps you just needed time to get to this conclusion?\n\nInfidelity is what got us here.

Then she sat on one end of my couch and completely crossed the line in the sand for me again and again over the course of a weekend. One mistake got us here.

Going on dinner dates, working or partying. \n\nI hate myself for the life I brought on to myself and I don’t know how to get out of it. Idk if it’s envy or just misery. \n\nI didn’t get accepted into nursing school back to back. I don’t have any real close friends. My boyfriend is my best friend but it’s not even the relationship I imagine for myself. I get body dysmorphia because my boyfriend used to oggle at instagram models with fake bodies. The friends that I have now are coworkers i met years ago and we just hang out occasionally. They’re out living their life and here I am home like a loser. \n\nMy boyfriend is out drinking with friends. I wish I would get taken out to try new things. He wont even spare $30 for a date on us unless its an occasion like a birthday or valentines. He asked me who is your best friend. I DO NOT HAVE ONE. I live with my parents still. The minimum I make is $100-$200 weekly or $250-$350 if hours are good. I have under 1k in my account right now. What am I doing wrong. After telling my boyfriend I do not have a real best friend he said “so like if we broke up you’d be super bored and lonely?”\n\nSadly its TRUE. That’s kind of why I stay with him not only because I love him, and have planned a future with him (been together for 8 years) and have this whole idea he’s going to change but I sometimes stay because he is all I have.\n\nI’m tired of this sometimes. I just want friends. I’m very easy to get along with. I’m generous I am supportive. I love anime and cinema and makeup and sports and pop culture and furthering education and fitness and religion and music I don’t get it. I’m not an ugly person either I’m conventionally attractive why can’t I find a best friend or friends. I want a friend group that grabs drinks on weekends or plans trips. I also want a boyfriend who will buy me flowers and not because I asked but because he wanted to! I’m 23 and I feel like a loser. When will it ever get better. I hate myself.

None of it was worth it ultimately, and I could’ve found happiness much sooner in life if I dint let fear dictate my choices.\n\nI am 26, so not too much older, and I don’t really have friends. I get the same feelings you do, and some days it sucks. But…why not go *do* something?

We were both outsiders not wanting to talk about boys and makeup. Often times we’d just chase each other around the hotels at our away tournaments and not see any of our teammates—they were cliquey. As we got older and aged into 19u league, they started changing and finding their identity as a male in a femme body. They took Testosterone and although hadn’t gotten any surgeries done, he decided not to return to play girls travel, which i understand to this day, especially since you literally undress almost completely in front of your whole team every practice and game. I understood, but I was sad. Sad because this was the only time I got to see him, since we didn’t grow up in the same town. \n\nA couple years later we bumped into each other and spontaneously we caught up — it was like no time had passed. We laughed just like we always did and we left it like we would see each other very soon because we’d both been missing each other’s company. A few weeks after, I get a text via Snapchat asking “for a friend” how and where to acquire pills to ween someone off of an addiction. \n\nI genuinely thought it was for a friend and I had no connection to anything besides pot and alcohol, so I just apologized saying I hadn’t a clue and offered to help in any other way but they just said thank you for trying and that was the last I ever heard from him.

But the truth is, people sadly make their own decisions to end their lives based on a mindset you’ll never understand. \n\nI’ve struggled to wrap my head around it, and even felt guilty seeing the rest of our hockey team at the funeral because… nobody else had heard from him after he left the team, and therefore ‘they couldn’t have known what he was going through’. \n\nBut, nobody else besides that individual really does.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I fell in love with my online jerk bud", "text": "I just need to write this shit out as some sort of therapy. \n\nI'm 30m, married to a woman for 7 years, I have it all, the job, the house, the family, the everything, I should be happy, imagine eagleton residents from parks and rec, that's probably what I look like from the outside... I also had an unexpected gay experience when I was young that fucked me up and cursed me, a curse that has grown through cycles of shame and guilt and disgust and curiosity and excitement and confusion for the last 17 years.\n\nEventually the curiosity part of the cycle led me to find people online to talk to and fantasize about.\n\n5 years ago I met someone I'll call M, M was my age, married, similar life, similar curiosities. We'd chat back and forth doing the whole \"not gay\" thing of swapping porn and having this roleplay like experience of talking to each other as we were both women which sort of clears the weird shame about discussing things like sex with men.\n\nMost \"jerk bud\" relationships last an hour at most, you chat, do horny internet stuff and never speak again, but sometime was different this time, for lack of a better word, the vibe was different and it was good, more human.\n\nWhat was at first quick horny chats and the occasional dick pic swap, turned into a friendship, we didn't know each other's names until 2 years in. We started talking about or life, we bonded over our shared interest, shared guilt, shared confusion. We opened up to each other about the path that led us here and how it can feel like a curse. We even transitioned at one point to trying to support each other in giving up porn, suppressing our gay curiosities and holding each other accountable to focusing on the real love and life we had in our wives.\n\nBut the cycle always repeats, and we found ourselves back in the guilt and curiosity except now things changed, we no longer tried to hide the gayness of it all, we openly discussed wanting men, going beyond sexual interest and fantasizing about loving a man. The obvious path opened up, us fantasizing about each other. We were talking everyday and not just about this stuff, but as friends, about everything and our shared \"problem\" gave ample room for extreme vulnerability and openness, what we found was the deepest emotional support and connection either of us had in our life.\n\nThings didn't really move from there for a while, we settled in to our real lives and used each other as outlets for the suppressed parts of us. It was more a bromance than romance. We were talking one night, occasionally we'd do voice calls when one of us was really down or needed to talk, we were both feeling the pressure of it all, we opened up about self hate, suicide, and all the fucked up things we have both struggled with again and again. We both ended up sobbing and eventually had to hang up as our \"errands\" could only go on so long. At this point we weren't even really doing the whole horny internet things any more, we probably hadn't even sent horny pics for months, it was all emotional.\n\nThe next morning I got a long message from him, more like a novel, probably 5x what I've written here so far. As open as we were with each other we were still typically guarded and this was the first time one of us cast all that off, he told me how I saved his life, how he feels thankful each day that we found each other and ended the message with \"I love you, I'm in love with you, in ways I don't understand\". Reading his message was like reading my mind, it was everything I wanted to say to him and I just started crying in the bathroom at my job. My boss actually heard me and asked what was wrong and I made up a story about my aunt dying, he said to take the day off and I did. I didn't go home though, I just drove, I drove almost two hundred miles away and back, just driving and thinking and crying and occasionally screaming at life.\n\nAll I know is that the only thing I wanted was to see him and hug him and kiss him and just be together, I've never felt that way before, it felt like celebration and mourning combined. I messaged him that I wanted to talk, and he was able to call me at e end of his work day.\n\nA lot of crying happened, a lot of feelings were shared, we talked about love, friendship, hardship. We joked about running away together... We also discussed reality, about the people we were hurting even if they didn't know, about the poison that this whole situation really was to our lives, we talked about how we didn't know sometimes if our relationship was helpful or if it was the only thing preventing both of us from putting all this shit in the past and living our real lives fully.\n\nHe told me he loved me, I told him I loved him to, how I wish I could be there to hold him and kiss him and how I wish we could shield ourselves from the world the the day and just cuddle on a mountain. (We had always talked about booking \"solo\" hiking trips to the same place, cuddling in a tent at the top of a mountain was always our shared fantasy).\n\nThe next day he left me a voice note, crying, he told me he can't speak to me anymore, how he has to find out if our relationship is medicine or poison.\n\nHe blocked me everywhere.\n\nThis was 3 months ago, I did a lot of crying, I had a lot of conflicting emotions. I want him to be happy, I want him to be able to do what I've never been able to do which is make this all disappear, I hope he's happy. I just wish I too got to choose if and when to try this option.\n\nAfter a month of mourning I decided I needed to take inspiration from him, I feel a little better. I always maintained a good and loving relationship with my wife, but today is better than ever before. I sometimes forget about it all, but really it comes back to me every single day. Waves of grief and hope take turns fucking me up at unexpected times. Just being in a particular aisle of a grocery store that I remember being on the phone with him in can just fucking destroy me. Sometimes I'll realize I haven't thought about it all for a few days.\n\nI don't know what I feel anymore or what I want. I don't know who I am, but I'm trying to figure out it.\n\nIf you're out there, M, I love you, probably always will. I truly hope you're finding what you want in life, if not, don't do anything stupid please. Maybe one day we can have a beer in the smokies and just laugh about all this.\n\nI'm happy I met you.\n\n", "score": 204, "num_comments": 130, "created_utc": 1767985216.0, "id": "1q8h0rs", "author": "trollpancakes", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8h0rs/i_fell_in_love_with_my_online_jerk_bud/"}

I don't know her so I can't know how she'll react, but for me, I would want to know this. \n\nLastly, you have to go to therapy. This is crucial because you absolutely need someone you can be 100% honest with. A good therapist won't excuse your behavior but they will help you navigate your own feelings and learn to love and accept yourself. Because you hate yourself. You did this because you hate yourself. You probably don't even fully understand how deeply that hate is, but this is not a way to live. \n\nYou did a really fucked up thing and you're going to really hurt your wife.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "There you go. He’s bi. He’s owning it. But honestly why get married to women? I think the answer is that it logically and statistically is a good thing to get married to a woman as a man. It provides you with an accountable partner, a purpose, a supporter, and a sex partner, stability…in so many ways a man’s -straight or otherwise- life improves. But it just doesn’t help your case. It was selfish to use this woman and her affections to assuage your own shame and insecurity within yourself. You may love her as a person, treat her well if I dare say that after this, be respectful, even have good sex. But honestly if this thread was about another woman you were falling in lust with, you’d be equally guilty. And let’s make this clear for you my friend, you are in lust with Mr. M not in love. He was an escape for you from the heavy truth of your insecurity for one. Secondly Mr. M has rejected and blocked you, abandoned you and you’re emotionally attached to him due to the nature of your conversations. You need immense healing to get over just that situational attachment. Coming clean to your wife would be a start to really confronting your deepest fears because likely your fears are penetrating other aspects of your life. Similar to how a food addiction is simply a symptom for deeper pain. The inability to live a healthy life is just a complication. If M was a female, I don’t think that would change your situation much. You lied. Emotionally cheated. Unsealed from childhood confusion or trauma. Not living in truth with who you are and what you want. You’re idle and lack purpose. Truly why did you even get married? Why not struggle as a single? Well because you wanted to actively present to ppl that nothing was amiss. That’s insecurity. So that’s the deepest part of it all and it has led to the symptoms you have shared.  I’m not going to assume your intimacy with wife is where it needs to be. It’s probably in the little things: sex from behind, less cuddles, less conversation after sex, wanting another person, being filled with lust you haven’t tamed with purpose and self control. So uhhh yh not gonna lie I’m confused about my sexuality even as I type this but I know the source. And let me tell you porn will amplify lust badly for anyone. The only thing u lacked in here was self control and security in your decision making. And knowing yourself. So your solution is to accept yourself for who you are and let those that love you for you not the fantasy of you get the full side of who you are. You’re not in love with that man, he was an escape. You don’t even know him. And what have you guys done for each other. It’s entirely emotional. All you have exposed is your emotions to us. Time to do the same for your wife, who’s woken up and chosen you for 7 years. Your high calling is to receive her when she’s knows the truth. Honor her moving forward or let her go if she wants to.

From day one, I trained five days a week. I never skipped. Every week my weights increased, my body changed fast, and people started noticing. I kept hearing the same thing over and over: “You have insane genetics.”\n\nAfter six months, I wasn’t the same person anymore. I used to hate my body. I was skinny, insecure, invisible. Suddenly I was confident, taking photos, getting compliments, likes, encouragement. People around me were shocked by how much I changed. For the first time in my life, I felt proud of myself. I felt like I finally found something I was good at.\n\nMy gym coach noticed too. He told me I was special. That my genetics were rare. That I could compete in a physique competition in just three months and maybe win 15,000 pounds. He spoke with so much confidence that I believed every word.\n\nHe said I just needed a strict diet, supplements, gym fees, and private coaching. I trusted him.\nThe next day, I took 1,600 pounds from my mom. I had never taken that kind of money in my life. Not for clothes. Not for food. Not for anything.\n\nMy diet became extremely expensive. Half a kilo of chicken breast every day. Eggs. Milk. Bland food I cooked myself. I forced myself to eat even when my body refused. I reached a point where after meals I would cut my arm with a razor out of depression and frustration. I wasn’t trying to die. I just didn’t know how to handle the pressure anymore.\n\nThen the coach told me I needed supplements for 3,000 pounds. That number was huge for me. I sold my phone to get them.\nThat phone was the first phone I ever owned in my life. My mom had just bought it for me. It was my only entertainment, my escape. I sold it without hesitation because I didn’t want to lose the dream he kept feeding me.\n\nThe supplements didn’t even last a month and a half.\nTwo months passed, and then he told me the competition was postponed for another three months.\n\nI had already spent more money than I ever imagined having. I was mentally destroyed but I kept going. I paid again. More coaching fees. More food. I was embarrassed in front of my family. They had to buy expensive food for the whole house so I wouldn’t feel alone eating differently.\n\nI quit smoking just to save money. Every pound in my life went to the gym or food. I couldn’t even afford a 5-pound box of cornflakes that was part of my diet. I had to beg my parents and siblings for money. Daily fights. No one believed in me anymore. Everyone thought I was wasting my life.\n\nFinally, the competition got close. All those months of bulking were over. Then came cutting.\nThe diet became even more expensive and the hunger was unbearable. My stomach hurt constantly. I couldn’t sleep. I woke up starving. Every morning I went to the gym fasted and walked on the treadmill for 30 minutes with no food. At night, I trained again.\n\nAll of this while I had just started my senior year of high school.\nI was exhausted, starving, mentally broken, but I kept telling myself it would be worth it when I stepped on that stage.\n\nTwo days before the competition, after the hardest weeks of my life, the coach told me something I will never forget.\nHe said I needed to pay 3,000 pounds as an entry fee to actually compete.\n\nNo one ever told me that before.\nI had zero money. Literally nothing.\n\nAt the same time, my sister was in intensive care with lupus. There wasn’t a single pound in our house.\nThere was no other competition. This was my only chance.\n\nI didn’t enter.\n\nI stood there realizing that after months of pain, hunger, selling my phone, hurting myself, disappointing my family, and destroying my mental health… everything ended because of 3,000 pounds I didn’t have.\n\nI didn’t feel angry.\nI felt empty.\nShocked.\nLike I had been chasing something that kept moving further away every time I got close.\n\nI didn’t lose a competition.\nI lost trust.\nI lost a part of myself that believed hard work is always enough.\n\nI just needed to get this off my chest.", "score": 20, "num_comments": 13, "created_utc": 1768023422.0, "id": "1q8vwdr", "author": "Unlikely-Rough8075", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8vwdr/sacrificed_my_mental_health_for_a_dream_that/"}

He is 25 years old.\n\nHe doesn't regularly brush his teeth or floss. Sometimes digs his nose and puts it in his teeth or, if he's driving, on the car seat. Doesn't clean his ears and the crust is easily visible. He showers using his hand even though I bought him a shower puff. He also can't reach his back because sometimes I can still smell the sweat on him when we cuddle. He's coughed up phlegm in the middle of the night  and spat it into a cup at our bedside (this was a regular occurrence when he stopped smoking but hasn't happened for a while now). I didn't know his shower schedule before we moved in together but when we did, it was clear he didn't prioritize it. I think he's a daily showerer now but recently, we had a moment... \n\nHe was laying on the couch after work and I told him I could smell his feet, to which he had no reaction. A few hours later, he was ready to hop into bed and I asked him to go shower first. He got upset that I didn't ask him to do it sooner and that led to a fight where I told him I feel like his parent sometimes. We've had conversations about his hygiene twice before but that talk was intense and it felt like we were going to break up. Since then, he has been brushing his teeth daily but the other things are still etched in my memory. It takes one trigger and suddenly I'm thinking about them all. \n\nI sometimes think about how bad his living situation was when we met. A few bad circumstances meant he had to move back to his mother's house and live in the garage for 2 years. There were flies, rubbish, food scraps, bottles and other things everywhere. His mother's dog even pooped in there a few times. He would always clean up and burn some incense when I got there though. I never wanted to judge him because it was clear this stems from the toxic and neglectful environment he was raised in. He moved to his own place after that and the conditions were better but still not great. I had family who lived close by but, since I grew up in extreme cleanliness at all times, we kind of agreed on never inviting them over to his place.\n\nOf course our place together is in great condition, I've designated the spare room as his space to be dirty in.

He was bigger than me, and he could have killed me easily. I also called the cops. He was arrested and confessed, and served 2 years in prison. He got short time only because law enforcement couldn't determine if he had extended his perversion to molesting children himself; he swore he only downloaded and watched videos. \n\nHe only got the mercy of getting his ass kicked, arrested and serving prison time because my elderly dog--who was locked in the bedroom--sighed loudly and that made me think of how it would break her heart if I went to prison for taking out a pedophile. I enjoyed kicking his ass though. The detectives were holding back laughter when they assured me he would not press charges because, \"He's not gonna want to admit to his new cell mate why he's walking so funny.\"\n\nI got blamed by my mother for ruining his life...until the detectives called her to set up a forensic assessment of my little sister, who was 4 at the time.

My dad's one of those cheesy guys who thinks their wives are their whole world. Like they've been together since college and how they're soul mates. My dad used to talk about how much he loves her and how they were meant together. He genuinely thought their story was cinematic and fascinating (it wasn't).\n\nI just vaguely remember waking up in the middle of the night as a teenager hearing yelling and noise downstairs. I came down to find my dad throwing and thrashing stuff around I've never seen him like that he was just so pissed normally he was such a calm guy no one had seen him angry and here he was. They calmed down after they saw me and told me to go back to bed. I used to use my dads computer for playing games and I ended up going through all his emails to a lawyer about divorce under causes of infidelity. I didn't know the full details but I was definitely snooping around more and the more i found the more I started to hate my mother. A few days after that mid night confrontation i didn't speak to either of them well no one spoke with anyone. My mum one day tried to corner me into talking with her and tried to forcefully hug me. I felt bad because she was crying but the moment she touched me i pushed her away and I ran back to my room.\n\nI was expecting them to get a divorce but surprisingly they just didn't. I do think my dad started cheating on her after that I've seen him many times with few strange women but I never said anything. The guy who used to brag about how lucky he was to find true love was now openly shitting on marriage and stuff. I just felt like my mom flipped a switch in him that no one could turn it back. I moved away for college and didn't really maintain contact with mum and even told dad not to bring her to graduation. My mum had a health scare recently and i guess this was the only time I actually saw my dad give a shit we went to the hospital and she was on the bed and she seemed happy to see me and she kept asking me if I would sit and talk with her since according to her that's \"all the medicine she needed\". I just nodded but I just couldn't bring myself to hold her hand or tell her that it would be okay or even just talk with her. I made so many excuses to not be in the room with her which made me realise that I haven't actually been in a room with her in years we used to be close but those days seem really far away. I just can't after all these years the hate just doesn't go away. The time I spent away from her she became a distant memory but now that I'm back I hate her even more idk why. I can't help it.\n\nEdit: i don't really know why I even went back to see her. I thought maybe it's really just serious and maybe this might be the last time I could get to see her but even if it was I don't think I can still stand her. All these years later a lot of the stuff I thought I made peace with just comes right back by just looking at her face. The world really isn't a fair place she's destroyed us and she gets to play victim and so many will stand by her. I don't want anything to do with her anymore. I can't stand her.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "As someone who experienced something similar (my mom cheated on my dad, then left us (dad + 4 kids) entirely for a few years).\n\nI (29F) had hard feelings for a long time. My mom and myself started to reconcile when I had a child and she spent so much time doing everything she could to show up for him (comes over every Wednesday and brings dinner when my husband has class). \n\nI will admit her leaving played a bigger role in my issues with her than her cheating on my dad, but my younger siblings (particularly my brother) DO resent her for what she did to my dad. My brother (27M) has just never really gotten over it. And has some kind of intense opinions about how women carry themselves because of it. \n\nI talked about my brother to say that you don’t have to feel bad - it’s not just you. There are others that have experienced at least similar things that have made having a relationship with the unfaithful parent hard and caused long term challenges with their view of the world.\n\nThe next piece I wanted to talk about was HOW significantly you felt it. I feel like a strong piece of how drastically you might feel this is because of how much it impacted how your dad shows up. My husband is a “walk around and tell me I’m pretty” kind of guy, and I think about how seriously that switch would impact our kiddo, going from seeing his dad have that much positive energy to so much negative energy at the drop of a hat. Of course it impacted you.\n\nYou aren’t required to do ANYTHING you don’t want to, YOUR BOUNDARIES ARE VALID. A few things to consider as you assess your next steps:\n1. Consider talking to your dad about the impact it’s had on you and see if he would be willing to talk about it in the interest of giving you closure — maybe (like other comments mention) there are things you don’t know, or he can talk through what he’s done to work through it that will give you a sense of him moving on (subsequently allowing you to move on).\n\n2. Remember your parents (and time) are finite. I don’t say that to say “you should just forgive your mom” - based off your post you might be 100% comfortable with this, but know that it’s real and (both) of their deaths are inevitable and probably closer than you realize. Once they’re gone, there is no revisiting this stuff with them. Those chances leave with them and it turns into strictly therapy sessions about the dead.\n3. Therapy is a great thing. As someone who has been in and out of it for years, it’s allowed me to move through blocks of unprocessed BS that I had held onto for too many years.\n\nI really do hope you are able to find the closure you need. I’m a strong advocate of parents being aware of how seriously their decisions can impact their children.. and how many children hold onto things whether they realize it or not.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767998587.0, "id": "nyon7jq", "author": "rissxveu"}

my side. i have had to gather a lot of my nerve just to write this out for a second time. i hate thinking about this, i hate talking about it, i hate how many people would just dismiss it as i consented to it\n\nfirst, my mental/emotional state. i have felt a lot of shame and pain for my whole life starting when i was around 6 years old. i was also m\\*lested by another family member when i was around 6. there were some other incidences before the age of 10 but they were minor compared to the first one. when i was around 11 i had hit a breaking point and started to engage in self harm. i would self harm regularly. when i was 14 i began substance abuse, but i was sober (technically, but here i think that a state of sobriety cannot be applied to the mentally ill state i was in) when i made this decision. i seriously planned on taking my life again, and did not because of someone else's intervention. \n\ni want to say that i know it was ultimately my choice. but i don't think it's fair to act like it was truly consensual given the circumstances. as my cousin and others would disagree, saying it was fully consensual. you all can make up your mind for yourselves. imo he took advantage of my willingness to harm myself.  \n  \nanyways. i was a very lonely child like genuinely this was why the first time i considered suicide was in my first grade classroom. i just didn't understand why everyone hated me so much, i was bullied A LOT and also bullied by my close family members. when i was around 10 i learned i could lie about things other people were interested in and make friends. this started a pattern of me lying just to be interesting. i honestly thought no one would care about me unless i lied and presented a different version of me.  \n  \nwhen i went to go visit him and his family i lied about so much stuff. i lied about my sexual history, my drug history, and how many followers i had on instagram because it impressed him. and i liked that. but then he started making advances. and i would reject his advances. then he would act like it was just a joke. he made repeated advances as well, and each time i rejected them and told him it was gross. its important to note before this point he just treated me like a family member he thought was annoying and didn't want to talk to.  \n  \nwhen i was like 15 something happened that made my self esteem drop. i felt a lot of shame and pain every day again but told no one. he moved to my country around this time. the advances began again.\n\nthe last time i told this story on here, there were people who said i had put a spin to victimize myself. i disagree. maybe its because they don't realize that i have felt dominated by others/unable to stand up for myself from an early age. and that i had been bullied for all of these years.\n\none way this manifested. when someone is mistreating me and they won't admit it, like in this situation, or gaslighting me saying their advances were a 'joke' after repeatedly making them, and then proceeding to mock me or make fun of me or body shame me in the same situation, idk what happens i get this itchy powerless feeling and my throat closes. and then i want to cry and this has happened before where i try to stand up for myself when someone is mistreating me and they won't admit it and i just end up crying. and they end up winning that situation further. whether you believe me or not, each time he did this i got the same painful itchy feeling.  \n  \na month after i turned 16, he came to stay with us. he would do things like come into my room and not leave when i asked him to. he continued to make advances/implications/jokes i would reject and then gaslight me saying it was a joke. i would get the same feeling of helplessness and shame each time. but obviously i never showed this  \n  \nthis time, we were in my room. he made another advance. a plan formed in my head and i pretended to enthusiastically agree. part of the reason i did this was just because i hated myself. the other part was that i would have evidence that all the times he made advances weren't just jokes. and that i could use this to hurt him in the future because now i had something more substantial than him making advances and then denying that he made them and then doing it again. which just made me feel anxious/helpless/crazy every time. in my mind, this would be painful but i could handle it and then i could just use it to hurt him further. in his mind, i enthusiastically consented and that is that.  \n  \ndefinately i was hoping he would realize this was wrong before i did it and stop the whole situation. but he never did. i gave him head and i was good at it too, because i wanted him to feel safe in what he was doing and then really get hurt/paranoid. i hated him and myself and wanted to mess him up. he was moaning and swearing. maybe my mom got the feeling something was up because like two minutes in she called us from downstairs. he immediately came in my mouth and i felt it hit the back of my throat like acid. remembering this feeling puts me in a state of distress/humilation to this day. i cried about it this morning and i have several times since it happened, knowing i will never be able to erase that feeling from the memory of my body. after he came i got up and puked it all out in into the toilet. up until this point i felt like i was winning/had power in the situation but as soon as this happened i understood i had been used, and i had let someone use me, i had harmed myself and allow myself to be harmed. and that even though i had willingly done this, i was still in going to be in pain/carry this memory with me for a long time  \n  \nafter, i immediately went to my room. he came with me. he told me that i shouldn't tell anyone what happened. he made another advance and i just stared at him. some days later, he left. i decided not to do anything about the situation and put it to bed. 6 months later i confronted him and he denied anything ever happening.  \n  \n3 years later i told my mom and his brother that something had happened. i told them that i had technically consented. my mom said that it was his mistake and my mistake and i agree. but i was the only one who was harmed- i did threaten that i would tell others when i confronted him and this messed him up for some time but genuinely hes okay now i can tell from his vibe. now hes successful and doing movies. i still remember the pain i felt when i understood that if i could have seen into the future and known what the actual feeling was like i never would have done it. again, i still have the memory of his cum hitting the back of my throat and just feeling so ashamed and disgusted with myself. this emotional memory, and the fact that i will never get any honest apology, or even just admitting that this happened, how i would be rude to him after this incident and he would ask why i was being rude like nothing happened, just makes me feel helpless the way i did before  \n  \nanyway that is my story think whatever you want to. i have told the truth from my side", "score": 5, "num_comments": 2,

I don’t pretend that I, an American, can go save other people when we cannot even save ourselves. I also remember 9/11, the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war, and how incredibly stupid it was, but it’s not surprising that given Netanyahu has more control of our government than most citizens and he’s the same man who intentionally destabilized Syria AND has his terrorist group (the merger of three separate terrorist groups within Palestine, the Lehi, the Irgun and the Haganah, now called the IDF- Israeli death fighters) is still occupying Southern Lebanon. I can only offer platitudes, but that’s better than ignoring the suffering of another. Maybe stop assuming what Americans think and feel by the inaccurate news you’ve probably been told to hate the American people for what the government does. The American people have not had control of their own government for decades. I don’t remember a single time, the government gave a fuck about what Americans think and feel. They are servants to oligarchs like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, who can rig elections and bribe politicians legally, because they are rich and corporations are people too, but somehow don’t have the same limits as humans have.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "[M22] Mental battle with self-worth and connection with others", "text": "TLDR: Text vomit about lacking, wanting affection, and coping with living alone; ig\n\nContext\n\nMy work entails me working night watch (6 pm - 6 am) two months at a time (currently on night schedule), and going back to days for another two months. Been living on my own for almost 2 years. Before which, I had a falling-out with my father, had a major disagreement with my study-group leader regarding my relationship, said relationship falling apart from the tension with her family and me putting an excessive amount of pressure on myself to finish my training (enlisted) and work out everything about moving to my first unit.\n\nLast winter was much harder than now. I wanted to give up everything. I was and am very alone, being 1000+ miles away from where I grew up, from everyone I knew, and my family. \n\nI enjoy standing watch with my co-workers and even call some friends, however outside of work there isn't many get-togethers, especially now. \n\nThe rest\n\nHaving been single the last 2 years HAS been an overall positive for me. I've reduced the pressure on myself to be what I think others believe I should be (leaning into a don't give a fuck mentality bit by bit). I (mostly) stopped berating myself for my needs, wants, vices, mistakes.\n\nI'm still in a state of feeling lonely. After moving, I haven't found new friends outside of work. One of my best friends  from work moved back home (after the military equivelant of getting fired, unjustly btw). \n\nTonight especially, I wish to have a friend or partner to, not really talk, but enjoy their prescence. Hold, kiss, eat with, watch a movie with, etc. \n\nMy childhood kept me very sheltered. Being raised Christian (which is still my personal belief, not actively practicing or attending church; this is for a few reasons) left me stunted, taught my sexual urges were \"of the flesh/not righteous,\" and influenced to overthink about not making anyone uncomfortable/come off as creepy.\n\nThe result was an awkward mess, who wasn't comfortable in himself, wasn't comfortable expressing what he wanted (especially to a woman), what his needs are, naive, chronic overthinker, walker of eggshells. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if people thought I was asexual or something. Especially because of the Christian (practically) shaming of the natural desires (to be clear: the church's teachings, not necessarily theology).\n\nBasically, sex was bad unless it was after marriage, it's a horrible sin to want intimacy before marriage, etc.\n\nAs the saying goes that Christians are the freakiest; I believe that intimacy is normal, healthy, and necessary. Especially before marriage. The boundaries for what goes before and after a marriage is up to each individual, and their interpretation of scripture.\n\nI also grew up with a mother who needed to present a certain appearance, and a father who needed control and supervision (the latter of which was appropriate until my late teens, when it became a point of contention between us). My escape growing up was books, where I could fall into a different world as a reprieve from my own.\n\nFor me, I just didn't get everything I needed from my parents, emotionally. Yes, they clothed me, fed me, put me through school, made sure I was healthy, etc. But (and call it gay if you want) but I didn't have the most supportive or respectful parents. Especially during the last years living with them. \n\nI guess all this to say is I find myself in a mental battle with myself about wanting to hope for what I didn't have up to now, or realizing and accepting my reality that American society has gone tits-up and it's next to impossible for our generation to win (financial stability, relationships, injustice). \n\nDespite my body, job, taking care of my business, growth as a person, etc; I still end up feeling the same, from 15 to 19 to 22 years old. Isolated, unwanted, longing, and alone in how I feel.\n\nIt's no joke that men have their own deep thoughts and emotions. This isn't a \"it'll get better\" or \"you're still young\" situation (imo), since I've heard it for many years. \n\nIdk, thoughts?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "What To Do When You Realize You Might Be Losing Your Closest Friend?", "text": "I think I’m beginning to understand that I may be losing my closest friend of 9+ years and I don’t know whether there is anything I can do to stop it.\n\nFrom the very beginning, we were different people. She was always disciplined, deeply perseverant and intensely committed to her studies. Responsibility came naturally to her and grades mattered a great deal, sometimes everything. I, on the other hand, was a bit slower in my rhythm. I studied closer to deadlines, disliked rushing, procrastinated more than I should have, yet still chased perfection in my own way. Grades mattered to me too, but they were never the whole story. Even our tastes, like movies, music, fashion, food habit, etc rarely aligned. And yet, somehow, we bonded.\n\nFrom the outside, we were seen as the “top duo” of our class.. the inseparable best friends. But beneath that image, an invisible competition quietly existed between us. I began to notice that whenever I scored higher than her or received more attention from teachers, her behavior toward me subtly shifted. And when she did better, I won’t deny that I sometimes felt a sting too. But I tried, earnestly, to celebrate her wins. I told myself she deserved them, that God had granted her success, and that I had no right to feel anything but happiness for her.\nThe comparisons never stopped. Friends, teachers, even parents constantly measured us against each other.\n\nAfter graduation, our lives diverged by physical presence, but we kept in contact virtually almost all the time. She secured a pretty relaxing job in a quieter, more peaceful city, one that allowed her to balance work and studies. I, however, entered a demanding job in a bustling city, spending hours in traffic every day, returning home exhausted (not immediately, but later). Health issues complicated things further for me. For 2-3 years, she prepared for her postgraduate exam and finally succeeded on her 3rd attempt. I couldn’t even prepare properly, so I didn’t try at all.\n\nWhen she passed, I congratulated her sincerely, multiple times. I truly was happy for her; I knew how much pain she had endured after each failure, and I had been the one to console her, to lift her spirits, to remind her of her worth. She had earned this moment. \n\nA few days later, my father learned of her success, and with it came another round of comparisons. I felt crushed, but again, I told myself: She deserves this. Around that time, I was already emotionally overwhelmed and had another exam the very next day. I didn’t reply to her messages.\n\nTwo days later, she texted me something along the lines of:\n“I know you’re transparent. I understand what you’re going through. I hope you overcome it.”\nI asked her to be direct.\nShe replied:\n“You know exactly what we’re talking about. It’s normal to feel this way. And if something good comes from a bad feeling, that’s better.”\nBefore I could respond, she deleted that message and replaced it with:\n“It’s nothing, leave it. By Almighty, you can do it if you try.”\nI still haven’t replied nor seenzoned it yet.\n\nAnd I don’t know how to.\nMy mind feels overcrowded with thoughts I don’t know how to organize. She has been my closest friend, the center of my small circle of six or seven people. I’ve always been deeply introverted, someone who struggles to express thoughts, to show vulnerability. In high school, I was even bullied for being too quiet. In medical school, the only friends I truly made were her and a few others I became close to through her.\nI’ve often been perceived as moody, perhaps because silence is my default when I’m overwhelmed. When I’m sad or confused, I retreat inward and try to carry everything alone. She did take care of me in her own way, I acknowledge that. She often called me her closest person. Yet, somehow, I almost always felt overshadowed.\nWhen I tried to share my family traumas or emotional struggles, she would redirect me back to studying, as if feelings were distractions to be overcome rather than realities to be held. Over time, I stopped opening up. Still, I accepted her as she was. I respected her. I wanted her to be happy.\n\nShe used to tell me we would pass our postgraduate exams together.\nNow she is achieving her dreams. I am genuinely happy for her. But deep inside, I know things will never be the same. I tried to keep our conversations light, normal, like before. Yet she brought up the one topic I desperately wanted to avoid. I know this is her moment to shine, her moment of triumph. No matter what I feel inside, I don’t want to dim that light. She deserves every bit of attention she worked so hard for.\nBut when she directly pointed to the very insecurity I was trying to quietly manage, it felt unbearable.\nMaybe this is where our parallel paths finally diverge. Maybe change is inevitable. I don’t know if I will ever feel equal beside her again. I feel inferior.. and then ashamed for feeling that way. I don’t know how to save this friendship, but I also don’t want to carry the guilt of being the one who ruined it.\nSometimes, disappearing feels easier.\n\nI don’t know what to do.\nI only know that something precious is quietly slipping through my hands, and I am trying, with whatever strength I have left, not to let it break me. \n\nHow do I respond to her with dignity?\nHow do I protect myself without appearing bitter or pitiful?\nDo I deserve to keep my self-respect intact while facing her? \nIs this friendship truly ending, or simply transforming into something so unknown or too unfamiliar to deal with?\nHow do I learn to exist without feeling overshadowed, without blaming myself for everything that falls apart?\n\n\n\nSorry for the long post, but I'd really love a bit of an advice &lt;3", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768033728.0, "id": "1q8yvwt", "author": "Sadiabae5", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8yvwt/what_to_do_when_you_realize_you_might_be_losing/"}

Anyways I have this \"friend\" of mine from highschool who came out to me last year, what shocked me wasn't just how brazen he was but also how much sex he had in his life. Every time we would meet (we started meeting up way more often after we both came out to each other) he'd go on and on about all the men, specifically older married men he has slept with, he'd tell me about his plans to hunt men from all over the country heck even foreign men. I never envied him, honestly I judged him in a prudish way.  \n  A few months later, we both had to get some work done in another city so we stayed in a hotel. I should say it at this point that I found my friend to be very much addicted to sex or rather men. He'd chase one after another. Say he's in relationship with someone while he'd constantly talk to other men and would lie to everyone that he's single. Anyways that night our conversation turned sexual and we ended up doing it. All I could say is that he was all over me and was passionate about it. After it was done, I held my head in my hands and processed the guilt. I didn't lend my body to him, I lent all of me to all his other friends that he talks to just like he shows me all the men he fucked. \n  I noticed something different in him after we came back home. He no longer saw any value in me. The box with my name was checked and he moved on to other men, even our mutual friends. I felt so used by him, that after experiencing me he no longer sees any thrill in me. \n  We had sex one more time after, but he wasn't passionate about it like before, almost like he took pity on me. I hate feeling like that. I hate that I want to do it with him again, not because I have feelings for him but because he's the only safe option I have.

It’s not hatred, and it’s definitely not something I’m proud of. Being around kids makes my body go into fight-or-flight mode. My chest tightens, my thoughts race, and all I want is to leave. Loud noises, unpredictability, sudden movements, and crying overwhelm me in a way I can’t just get over, no matter how much people tell me it’s normal or that I’ll change my mind one day.\n\nWhat makes it harder is the constant social pressure to like kids or to see them as inherently joyful. I even have nephews, and while I care about them and want them to be safe and happy, being around them for extended periods is incredibly stressful for me. That contradiction eats at me. When I say I don’t want children or that being around them stresses me out, people immediately assume I’m cruel, immature, or broken. I feel a lot of guilt about something I never chose, especially because I know kids are just being kids.\n\nI avoid family gatherings, public places, and even certain friendships because I’m afraid of being put in situations where I’ll panic and then be judged for it. I’m working on understanding where this fear comes from and managing it better, but I needed to get this off my chest because it’s isolating to carry around something that feels so socially unacceptable.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I think childhood trauma made me asexual and I hate it.", "text": "When I was little, my mother had been very addicted to a certain mmorpg. I'd always watch her play it (I was like 4-5 years old), and when I was 6, I finally got to make my own account and also became very addicted.\n\nShe pretended to be a lot younger than she actually was and would date men on there. Instead of me being her daughter, I was now suddenly her little sister. My mom would even \"marry\" some of the guys on there, despite actually being married for a full decade in real life. We would quest and play with these random boys, and there were always several of them, but they were always kept a secret from each other. Sometimes she would purposefully (and accidentally) expose/introduce them to each other so that they would fight over her. I think at some point she had at least 4 different boyfriends at once.\n\nThis might come off of a rant, but I really just want to talk about it.\n\nAll of the boys were, of course, extremely sexual towards my mom, some more than others. While she and I and some guy were questing, I'd be able to hear her typing and laughing in the living room on her laptop, flirting with them and such. I hated it so much. She always kept it a secret from my dad, too.\n\nThere were a ton of different guys she dated, but there was one that REALLY stuck around for a long time. I'll call him \"T.\" T was a total loser and had nothing going on for him and whatnot, and was OBSESSED with my mom. She'd stay up super late just to talk to him and play with him since he lived in a different timezone, but he'd also wake up and play early for her... so they really just wanted to spend all day together. T was my least favorite out of all the boyfriends because before meeting him, she had finally gotten rid of all of the other guys. I just remember being in her in-game house with him and they talked about being in a relationship and I kept crying and begging her to forget about him. I remember crying \"not again!\" and her telling me to stop crying before my dad got home so he wouldn't ask me what was wrong.\n\nShe stopped cooking as much, she'd rush to get me to school, all that jazz. I felt like I had to fight for her attention. If I asked for help with something, she'd say \"hold on\" and make me wait half an hour before I had to re-ask her or she'd finally help me. She'd even take her laptop with her into the bathroom and sit there for an hour before finally getting off.\n\nI never felt like I was her priority, and at some point, I tried doing something about it. On one of my birthdays, things were going as usual. I forgot why, but T had wanted to log onto my account, and my mother let him despite my protests. I can't remember if this was THE first time he ever logged on because he had been logging on randomly at some point in time, but whatever. \n\nBefore he logged on, I had made sure to delete one of two of my super rare weapons because I wanted to pin the blame on him. Of course he claimed he didn't do it, because he didn't, but the thing that really bothered me was that she believed him over me. Yes, he didn't do it, but she still trusted some random lustful asshole online instead of her own daughter. I think I was probably 8 or 9 at the time, I can't remember. She always said it was \"Just for fun,\" but sometimes I think she genuinely loved this guy even though he just talked about his genitals 24/7. I also know she probably just liked all the attention she got from him and the others.\n\nThis T guy in particular was very troublesome because they ALWAYS got into fights. She'd pick me up from school, and the moment I got in the car, she'd tell me about how I'd have to go home and get online ASAP so that I could \"talk to T\" for her.  And by \"talk to T\" she meant that she talks through me, basically. I had to type whatever she wanted to T to settle their argument. This sometimes took hours. This was damn near everyday and I hated it. I hated HIM. I hated ALL OF THEM.  He was overbearingly sexual towards her and he'd do it right in front of me because he thought my reactions were hilarious. Remember, I was her little sister, not her daughter, so I was just mad that my older sister wasn't paying attention to me. It sounds a lot dumber when you replace it with \"sister\" instead of \"mom.\" I'd get super pissed and start crying and yelling at him through the screen, and I guess he just loved every second of it. And she \"married\" this guy in the game... twice, I think, since they always got into fights.\n\nI'm 19 years old now. Ever since I was around 16, I was like \"huh... y'know, I'm pretty mature now. Some of my friends are starting to have sex.\" and yada yada. I realized that I just never ever got horny. I still never have. I've never felt a desire to be physically close to someone, I've never \"lusted\" after someone. I brought this up to my dad (to which he then redirected me to my mom lol) and she was like \"ehh don't worry, you just haven't met the right guy yet,\" but I don't think that's the case. I don't even like kissing! And kissing is hyped up in every disney teen movie-- it's GOTTA be something miraculous, right?\n\nKind of a side note, but in high school, I had a crush on this one guy for 3 years. He asked me to be his girlfriend and I instantly accepted, but the day after I accepted, I instantly lost all interest in him. I guess this is considered me \"liking the chase\" instead of the end result, but I just thought it was worth a mention. I broke up with him after a day and we had tried being together again, but I ended it AGAIN because I lost feelings instantly, and broke up with him just a few weeks later. Do you think this is correlated?\n\nSomething that makes me believe this may be part of my childhood is because I HATE seeing my parents express love towards each other. Sometimes my mom will sit on my dad's lap (not in the sexual position) and it just pisses me off for some reason. I hate seeing them kiss, sometimes I hate seeing them hold hands. I hate when they do a long, intimate hug. I can't even explain why.\n\nI hate being asexual. I feel like if someone ever got into a relationship with me, they'd just be settling. Why would you wanna be with someone, even if they're great, if they don't wanna have sex? I've heard people online say that a partner without sex is just a friend... do the masses really feel that way? I hope not. I'd also go batshit insane if I ever found out my partner watched porn or anything like that because I'd be... jealous, I guess? I dunno, but the thought of it pisses me off. \n\nI think naked bodies are so disgusting, even if they're muscular and lean and good looking. I cannot bear to look at genitals, they're just so gross. I can only get turned on through reading, but even that arousal lasts like... 10 seconds (also, probably TMI but I feel it's worth mentioning that I have 0 sensitivity down there. Is that normal amongst asexuals?) I don't think I could participate in sex with a trusted partner even if I wanted to, because I just don't feel that my body would respond appropriately. \n\n I have a strong hatred for men that objectify women, and because of that, I want a very specific type of partner because I feel like I would just despise being with him otherwise. A part of me wants to be desired and sexualized, but it has to be with the right person. I guess that part is normal, though. I'd imagine that this extreme hatred comes from my mom. \n\nAnyway... What are the odds this is all because of my childhood? I WANT to connect physically with someone, but I just can't because it's so gross to me. I've never been in a situation where I am actually given the opportunity to be intimate with someone I do trust, so I don't know how I'd react. However, I do know that I cringe and have to look away when I accidentally see naked people online. I hate porn, it's so gross.\n\nI feel half human. I often try to compare it to hunger because a lot of people do not understand asexuality; Imagine you never feel hunger and therefore do not want to eat. You see advertisements for food EVERYWHERE, it's ALWAYS on TV. You see and hear about people eating every single day. People that you like being around invite you to go out to eat, but you have to decline. You're simply not hungry. You suppose that you technically... COULD eat, but do you really want to? Not really. But now everyone thinks you're weird. They've never seen you eating with anyone! Who the hell does that? You're in college, you should be enjoying all the amazing food out there! Looots of people would wanna eat with you, you know! But if you eat, you think you'll throw up. Does that make sense?\n\nI don't know how to end this post but thanks for reading if you did ;-;", "score": 10, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": 1768012377.0, "id": "1q8s4zv", "author": "Background_Froyo3653", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8s4zv/i_think_childhood_trauma_made_me_asexual_and_i/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "Hey so some alternate perspective here.\n\n\nI know a guy who did this. He cheated dozens of times on his wife. The guilt ate him alive after a few years and he ended up confessing to her. She forgave him and said she'd stay if they went to couples therapy. This opened up a psychological investigation into his behavior. It was very clear that he was some kind of sex addict with some history of sexual abuse in his childhood that he had never faced.\n\n\nMy friend went to therapy for a few years and he and his wife did pretty well. He ended up killing himself last year, which nobody saw coming. He explained in the letter he left that he truly felt horrible for what he did, and he swore that since his confession he had not cheated or broken her trust in any way. But he could not bear the shame, and could not deny that he still had the urges.\n\n\nI spoke with him several times before he died. We spoke at length about what it was that made him cheat. Through therapy he learned about himself that his primary sexual motivator was novelty. Novelty means a lot of things, but for him it meant new people. New people were appealing to him because they could not hurt him emotionally, and he would not get attached to them. This came from his abuse, in which his first \"sexual\" (nonconsensual) experiences were foisted on him by a person he loved and trusted.\n\n\nHe told me a lot of things about the addiction and how he never ever meant to harm his partner and he was not doing it out of malice. He just was not able to be satisfied by one person. In fact, he was never satisfied ever. Hence addiction.\n\n\nIt's very easy for us to look at people like him and call him a monster and say he deserves what he gets, and why didn't he just dump his wife so he could go fuck around. But addicts of all types long for acceptance and they seek love when they aren't seeking their drug. It is a complicated matter.\n\n\nI'm not saying any of this to defend your boyfriend. I'm saying it to tell you honestly, his cheating was NOT about you. It was about him. He has a lot of maturing and a lot of therapy to do. You MIGHT be able to reduce the likelihood he will do this to someone else in the future by reading this comment to him and encouraging him to seek therapy immediately because he IS an addict and HE NEEDS HELP. He's young, so right now it doesn't feel like addiction. But it is, and he needs to attack it right away before he grows up and gets into a really horrific situation where he's cheating on his wife and she's financially dependent upon her.\n\n\nCheating is very bad. But nobody should be killing themselves over it on either side.

It was heartbreaking to see her get hurt. she went to the hospital and ended up going under anesthesia to have her damaged front teeth pulled out. Unfortunately, her baby teeth affected her adult teeth, so when they grew in, they were crooked and didn’t come down properly. \n\nIt really hurt me to see her struggle with her smile. It was a huge insecurity for her and it was my fault. She always did closed mouth smiles. To me she was always perfect. I knew that she knew she was beautiful too but I can see how much her smile weighed on her self esteem. I genuinely felt it was holding her back from pursuing her dream of modeling as well. \n\nI felt so guilty for years and always wondered if her life wouldve been better/different if i wasn't such a stupid kid that day and just let her have the damn bear. Of course after that i let her keep the bear and never argued over toys or belongings again. I helped her get invisalign in hopes it would fix this problem and after 20 years of worrying she would never have her smile back here we are today and she has perfect beautiful straighter teeth than mine.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I was conditioned through media and porn to “want” light BDSM, and it took years to unlearn.", "text": "TW-Sex/abuse? In bed. This is something I’ve come to realize last year. \n\nI’m a woman in my mid/late twenties, old GenZ. I was raised by strict religious parents with no talk of sex or relationships. Since I was 18, my boyfriends and partners were always sliiiggtly violent in bed. No discussion first. I don’t really like porn, but having perused it before I had seen this behavior and so when I became sexually active I had to assume it was normal. Choking, even lightly, slapping, grabbing, ramming, hair pulling, excitement and increased energy over my pain. Like my pain turned them on. \n\nI wholly thought I enjoyed it back then. I considered myself kinky. My most recent ex was into rope play and other shit I don’t even know the name of, and praised my openness and willingness to partake. I’m not helpless, I’m a confident adult woman-I want to be clear I am not incapable of stopping scenarios I am not comfortable with (I have before), but frankly I never had the chance to experience normal sex or know how incredible passion can be. I had been steady (1-2 years) with three men in my life, and hooked up with a couple more whom I briefly dated, but only now with my current boyfriend do I actually enjoy sex. \n\nSex had really become a chore in my previous relationships. Not finishing was normal for me, performing and making it wonderful for my partner was the entire act. There was also pouting or clear disappointment when I didn’t want to have sex, which always made the act feel more taxing and made me feel like I had to in order to appease my partner. With all my exes I grew resentment and stopped having sex with them, I began to hate them and find their bodies repulsive. I didn’t know why, or how tied to sex it was. \n\nWith my current boyfriend, everything has changed. I am incredibly in love. He never has EVER pressured for sex. He has never pouted or shown disappointment, he loves me so much that cuddling sates him. Sex does not feel like a chore any longer, and my libido has come back after years of it being non-existent. I finish every time, there is no choking or slapping or hurting. He cradles me and loves me and treats my body with so much care and love. Could it have been like this the entire time? It feels so much more wonderful to feel desired rather than used for desire. \n\nThere was one time early on in our relationship where we were going to have sex after a fun date, but I was in a bad mood and still a little intoxicated (we both were). Per usual, I was still going to do it, but it was 100% in chore mode. I just wanted to get it over with. Before we even started, he could tell I wasn’t feeling good and said “let’s just cuddle”. I was afraid of the disappointment, the pouting that follows, so I insisted we still did it. He refused, wrapped me up in a blanket and held me while we fell asleep. I think that was the turning point for me. Sex was not a chore anymore, it is something you do when you want to do it. That small gesture of his was massively healing, he has no idea. I had gotten to the point where I thought I was asexual, but now I realize I was just having shitty selfish sex. \n\nHe is my best friend. He cries on my shoulder, I on his, we play video games for hours (we recently did 20 straight 🤭), we go to the gym together, we watch shows and travel. I had to date the men I dated and have the experiences I’ve had to get to where I am at now, so I don’t regret it. He, too, has a storied past with women, and told me he wasn’t always the man he is now.\n\nAll this to say, I know my experience isn’t uncommon. Sex can be wonderful, your partner doesn’t need to pout or guilt you into it, and if they are, know that there are people out there who won’t push you past your comfort level and will respect you fully, not just in words but in their actions. Sex doesn’t have to be a chore, it can be enjoyed.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I married my wife and sometimes I wish I hadn’t.", "text": "I know how awful that sounds. I’m not saying I don’t love my wife. I do. She’s kind, loyal, and she’s been with me through seasons where I honestly don’t know why she stayed.\n\nBut I’m 37M*, she’s 41F, and we’ve been married 15 years. She lived in Mexico before we got married, and after we got together she moved to the US to build a life with me.\n\nHer family isn’t “private jet” rich, but they’re very well off. Stable. Connected. The kind of stable where problems are inconvenient, not life-altering. I grew up poor. Like, counting change and hoping the card doesn’t decline poor. I’ve always had this anxious relationship with money where it feels like it can disappear if I look away for too long.\n\nAnd right now we’re struggling financially. Not in a cute “we eat ramen sometimes” way. In a way that makes you do mental math every time the car makes a noise. In a way that turns small surprises into mini disasters. In a way that can make you feel like you’re failing as a husband, even if you’re working your tail off.\n\nHere’s the part I can’t shake.\n\nI keep thinking that if she never met me, her life trajectory would have been better.\n\nI picture an alternate version of her life where she stayed close to her family, stayed in her culture, stayed in a place where she had a safety net and support and familiarity. Maybe she would have married someone else. Maybe she wouldn’t have. But I can’t stop thinking she would be happier and more secure than she is now.\n\nAnd the worst part is the guilt feels… righteous, like I deserve it.\n\nShe never throws it in my face. She doesn’t talk down to me. She doesn’t compare our life to what she “could have had.” She actually tries to encourage me when I’m spiraling. That makes me feel even worse, because she’s not even punishing me. I’m doing it to myself.\n\nSometimes when she’s on the phone with her family, I hear how easy things sound for them, and I feel like I dragged her into hard mode for no reason. Like she traded stability for love, and love wasn’t supposed to come with this many overdraft fees and stress headaches.\n\nI know marriage is supposed to be “for better or worse,” and we’ve had good years too. We’ve had real joy, real laughs, real moments where I look at her and think, I cannot believe I get to be loved by you.\n\nBut the financial pressure makes everything feel heavier. It makes me question myself constantly. It makes me look at her and feel this ugly mix of gratitude and shame.\n\nI don’t know how to stop feeling like the villain in my own story.\n\nI don’t want to leave her. That’s not what this is. I just wish I could go back in time and give her the life she deserved without the struggle that came with me.\n\nI haven’t said all of this to her because I don’t want to dump my guilt onto her shoulders too. She already carries enough. I just needed to say it somewhere, because it’s been sitting in my chest like a stone.\n\nIf you’ve read this far, thanks. I’m not looking for judgment or pity. I just needed to get it out.\n\n\n*Edit: for my age I had a typo I am 37 not 34. For added context she just turned 41 last month age gap is 3 years 8 months.

This wasn’t out of the ordinary, for the past couple of years he had been doing this. I had a suspicion that he was using drugs. I tried searching when he was at work, but I could never find the evidence and so I never confronted him.\n\nI had a normal day at work, had a doctor’s appointment and got to leave work early. A huge pang of dread filled me as I was driving home, and my conscious kept telling me, “ you’re going to have the worst night of your life, you better go to the liquor store”.\n\nWhen I got home from work, my dad’s bedroom door was still shut and the light was still on. Our two cats were waiting outside the bedroom and they hadn’t been fed. I knocked on the door and called for him but there was no answer, I tried the handle and it was locked.\n\nI was frozen and I didn’t know what to do, I went to my bedroom and started crying and hyperventilating. I physically hid under my bedroom covers as if I was a child and tried to plan what I was going to do next. What would I tell the police? Do I even call them, or do I kick down the door myself? I stayed like that for an hour until what felt like a gust of wind hit me, the room got so fucking cold that the blankets didn’t even help me.\n\nWhen the fire department showed up at my house, they didn’t take me seriously about my request for a welfare check. But when they kicked down my dad’s bedroom door he was laying in the middle of the room, dead. He had been dead for approximately 12 hours, he had overdosed on drugs while I slept in the next room.\n\nI don’t know why I had that instinct, but I am grateful for it. It made me calm and reasonable while my house was a crime scene. It also is the reason I didn’t kick the door down myself. What I saw was enough to give me ptsd, I can imagine it would have been worse if I tried to give life saving measures myself. \n\nThe past two years without my dad have been hell, they’ve been incredibly lonely. I had another dream about him last night, and when they happen the grief intensifies. I don’t have many people to talk to this about, especially some of the more traumatic memories of that time.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "I'm so very sorry sorry for your loss of your dear dad. \n\nI don't know him obviously, but I'm hoping that even if he had started using drugs, I hope he was still a good father to you, and that he had been a good father to you growing up. \n\nSometimes adults go through a difficult time for a whole host of reasons which can cause them to start using, but I think the important thing is to focus on how he treated you, what kind of father he was to you, especially before the drugs. Focus on those good memories as that's who he really was deep down. \n\nYou may find it helps to write down some of the food memories you have of him, maybe make a scrap book of photos of him and you both together over the years, so you not only have a book of good memories you've written about, but a whole range of photos printed out of him when he was alive and healthy and happy. It may help to get the bad image out of your head from the night he died and how he was found. Maybe print some to put on your walls in your house etc. surround yourself with the good happy memories and focus on who he was when healthy. \n\nYou may also find it helpful to talk to him. I talk to my dad practically every day, even if just to say goodnight and I love and miss him. Other times I talk to him more about other things, like good memories with him, how I loves taking care of him (he has dementia and became bed bound and non verbal in later years, but he always knew who me and my mum were, and responded positively). I'd tell him I liked taking care of him and it was an honour, and how I miss him etc. \nI don't really believe in god, but I do believe our loved ones are around us, watching over us, and can hear us etc. And talking to him brings me comfort that he's listening. \n\nSo find whatever brings you comfort, however you want to honour and remember him. I like having a lot of keep sake memorial type gift items for my dad, like candle holders with a dad verse on, a charm with his ashes in, and a ring with his ashes in I wear every day to feel like he's with me. I have a photo blanket I made for him in the home which has big photos of us on together so he could see us easily, and it's now hanging on my lounge door to see every day. I've got hanging plaques with loving verses on too. I just find comfort in having items to remember him, honour him, show him I still love and miss him, and things that make me feel he's with me. \n\nSo find what works for you to help you with your grief and trauma. Some grief therapy may help due to the nature of his death, but you can also choose ways you want to remember him by, and help your memories be the happy positive ones, not the final one. You won't ever forget it, but you can work on remembering him in a better way, happy photos etc, so you focus on those thoughts instead. \n\nAgain I'm so sorry for your loss, and the trauma you experienced at the time.", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1767942327.0, "id": "nyk0h9f", "author": "Poppypie77"}

For a long time, it felt like a curse to feel so deeply especially on my darkest days, and man, those days felt unbearable. My sensitivity trapped me in my feelings and made me dwell on pain longer than I should. I used to pray to God to make me different, but instead, He showed me the beauty that comes with having an emotionally rich inner world.\n\nI realized that my life is a lot more colourful than most people’s, which makes life a lot more beautiful. Some people have never experienced listening to music and being touched in the deep crevices of their soul to the point of crying. If you are sensitive, you are also most likely an empath, meaning you can connect to emotions through movie characters. You can feel every emotion as if their feelings were your own, and if you’re like me, you can even connect with villains. That’s why this year I vowed to watch more movies to experience the colourfulness of my inner world through my sensitivity.\n\nThis doesn’t only relate to movies but to real life too. Sensitivity also allows you to see people who are unseen. You can feel people’s emotions even when they try their best to hide them. That is ultimately why the world needs people like us. We notice the small things through our feelings. It feels like a curse a lot of the time, but it is also such a gift. I’m not going to lie I’m still learning to love this part of me because no matter how hard I try it will not go away.

I know I will get a lot of hate for what I'm about to say but I can't handle keeping it inside anymore.\n\nI (F26) dated my first love when I was 16 for a year. It was a crazy \"puppy love\" kinda thing. Very intense, we argued but we were also making out for 3 hours. The classic first love dynamic. Too young to have a stable relationship but the feelings were real. We ended things because I've caught him texting a girl and we tried to make it work after that but we were both so immature I told him after a few months I don't want to do it anymore. So after a bit more than a year it was over.\n\nRight after it we both got in new relationships, they lasted a few years. He would text me every once in a while (like once a year) and we would text for a few weeks (hiding it from our partners). No nudes or anything but there was some flirting and stuff. Our attraction is undeniable. But in our fashion we would always then get into an argument and stop talking for a year until he texted again.\n\nFast forward to now. We both have \"new\" partners. He's been with his girlfriend for 2 years and I've been with my boyfriend for almost 5. I love my boyfriend and I want to build a future with him. We are on the same level on almost everything. Today I went shopping for some clothes and I saw my ex with his girl and I've never seen her before. I haven't seen him in more than a year. We all just said hi. My heart started racing and I was sweating. Now I came home and my heart feels so heavy...\n\nI've never cheated on my bf with my ex. But he has texted me since I've been with him but it was just a bit before he got into this relationship. He was all flirty, we had coffee without my bf knowing (i know it's bad) and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted me but I went home. The thing is that it can't work between us.  I know this sounds bad but there is a huge intellectual gap (think I'm doing PhD and he barely finished high school). He has a really good job with good salary so it's not about the money. It's just we don't have much to talk about. It didn't bother me when I was 16 but it would now. \n\nSo I know that it wouldn't work. I'm happy with my bf. Why can't I stop thinking about him? Why do I feel so bad now that I saw him with his gf? I feel like i will never be as attracted to anyone as I was to him when I was 16, full of hormones and not a single care in the world. I admit I'm still attracted to him but fully aware it wouldn't work. In a weird way just knowing he wants me makes me feel so good. Like whenever he would text me before and I would see he still wants me... I would feel so confident and empowered. Now I think he's really serious about this new girl. And I want him to be happy. But I'm dreading the day I find out he proposed. I don't want to marry him. But I don't want him to forget me. \n\nI don't know what I'm asking. I don't know why I'm writting this. I just know I can't say it out loud. Does anyone ever really get over their first love? Is it normal that the attraction is still there? I don't know if it is normal for me to feel this way.

My ex started dating a new girl two weeks after we broke up, which honestly isn’t humanly possible unless something was already going on. I stayed loyal, I invested years and now I’m the one in therapy trying to put myself back together.\n\nMeanwhile, he’s out there happy, traveling, enjoying life with his new girlfriend like nothing happened.\n\nPeople keep telling me “karma will get him” or “life balances things out,” but I don’t see it. If karma was real, why does the person who cheated get love and peace while the one who was honest gets trauma?\n\nI recently saw interviews of Jennifer Aniston. Brad Pitt cheated on her with Angelina Jolie, they went on to be this iconic couple, and Jennifer was left alone for years. People use stories like that to cope, but honestly, it just reinforces how unfair life can be. Being a good person doesn’t protect you. Being loyal doesn’t guarantee a happy ending.\n\nMaybe karma isn’t real. Maybe it’s just a comforting story we tell ourselves so the pain feels justified.

She wasn't really making sense. She was brought to the hospital. They think she had a bleeding in the brain, and it apparently wasn't the first one. The first few weeks, she was sort of doing good. You could talk to her etc, she was just having trouble talking and was tired. They put her on a lot of medication. We saw her slipping away from us and regressing to an almost childlike state, started talking about going on vacation with a man she loved, etc. (We've never heard of him). A family member who studied medicine wasn't too happy with the kind of medication they put her on. At one moment, they had to tie her to the bed at night to keep her from falling and keep her calm. Even gave her some sort of mittens so she couldn't open the restraints. That broke my heart. She kept regressing and, in the end, was kept under for most of the days.

What I've also understood is that these are suppressed feelings, that sometimes I might be frustrated by or angry at something or be uneased, and then I just let it be and a lot of things add up slowly and slowly.\nWhat I've realized since is also that I have a lot of 'steam', you know when people say 'let off steam' ? I think that's what I need. If i have so much of it deep down, I have to channel it out firstly by journaling at a fixed time as discipline everyday and secondly by doing something about everything, and also to make myself healthy. An active body really helps towards a healthy mind and a more stable flow of emotions, and I think gym does that for me. If you let everything out slowly, and then maintain your emotional balance as well and still keep your body and mind going as a healthy form, you can avoid letting anger and frustration seep out on those little inconveniences that don't warrant that big a reaction.\n\nAnd that imo is the first step of dealing with your own emotions, particularly negative ones. And hey, you probably already know this, but you are still a human for having them. Infact since you want to actively improve it, that makes you a kind person too.

My life was really good from beginning, good school life with good friends. And I got a good college with computer science branch which I always wanted to pursue. Everything was good but then I got sick. \nI was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis which is a skin disorder. It all started with small bruises in my hand but it spreaded quickly. The doctors gave me steroid medication and it resolved the disease. But everytime, it keep coming back with more intensity. \nMy skin got so thin that just pressing it would instantly make it bleed or it water started to come out. I couldn't sleep due to itchiness and pain. My skin used to shed every day and my bedsheet was covered in water and blood. The first two semesters passed somehow but my grades were very low. I couldn't attend the 3rd sem and barely passed it.\nMy condition was so bad that I wasn't able to stand straight. I wasn't able to fold my arms because of the cuts. My neck was not moving and bathing used to feel like someone is pouring acid on my skin. I used to feel cold even on sunny days because my skin was completely damaged.\nAdditionally, my body got tanned, it was pigmented and swelled. My face would look not human, like a monster. This has severely impacted my self confidence. I started to stay inside, and avoid any possible social contact.\nIn 4th sem, they gave me year back due to attendance shortage. I could have passed the exams but they didn't even allowed me to write them. I was really sad because I was once a topper in my school. \nI went to my hometown for 3 months and recovered a little. I came back to join the college with juniors and cleared 4th sem and then 5th sem. Right now I am on methotrexate which is also a very strong drug. Though my dosage is very small but I have to regularly get my blood checkups for any anomaly. \nI am physically recovering but my mental health is very disturbed. I don't have any friends or people with me. I lost my school friends and couldn't make any new ones in college. People know me but not personally. I joined clubs, thanks to some editing skills I learnt in lockdown. But everyone seems so invested in their own lives. \nI live with my mom but I can't share my thoughts with her because I can't see her worried. My parents already saw me in pain for 3 years. I am the eldest among all my cousins so I can't tell them also. I don't have anyone who could understand this. \nI just want someone who can talk to me. I can't rely on chat gpt for this. I need some form of human connection. I can't sleep with all this trauma and I barely get sleep. Whenever I go outside or in my college, I see people happy, talking and laughing. I just sit alone and hoping to be a part of them. \nMy parents doesn't force me to study but they keep hoping that I become successful. I know hoping is not bad, but they sometimes compare me with others. Their hope is justified because I was once a very good student. \nRight now I have started working out, I do coding and video editing sometimes. But even after doing all this, I don't feel good or proud. I think the only way to end this pain is to end myself. \n\nI don't want to live but I am so coward to even commit suicide.

I laughed along, but somewhere in my head I started believing it — not literally, of course, but in the sense that she deserved someone perfect. Someone confident. Someone like him.\n\nAnd I wasn’t.\n\nThat thought stayed with me.\n\nShe introduced me to her two best friends. They were nice to me. One day, one of them asked me directly if I liked her.\n\nI said no.\n\nNot because I didn’t. But because I thought she was out of my league. Because I didn’t think I could ever be “enough.”\n\nHer friends asked me again later. And again. Every time, I said no. Each time, it felt easier to lie than to risk losing what we already had.\n\nThen a friend of mine proposed to her. That’s when everything hit me at once. She didn’t accept him immediately, but instead of finally being honest, I pulled away. I became quiet. Sometimes rude. In my head, I acted like she was “mine,” even though I’d never had the courage to say it out loud.\n\nThat probably pushed her away.\n\nA couple of months later, she started dating him. He told her a lot of bad things about me — things that weren’t true. She stopped talking to me completely. One month before boards, I wished her luck. She replied, “Same to you. Maybe we won’t meet again.”\n\nWe didn’t.\n\nHe blocked me everywhere from her phone — number, Facebook, everything. Years passed. I never really forgot her.\n\nIn 2022, she unblocked me. I sent a simple message asking how she was. She replied politely. Normal. Like someone I once knew very well.\n\nThat was it.\n\nNo confession.\nNo closure.\nJust something unfinished that still sits with me.\n\nI guess I’m writing this to say — if you like someone, say it. Even if you’re scared. Even if you think you’re not enough. Rejection hurts, but carrying a “what if” for years hurts more.\n\nI learned that the hard way.\n\nIf only….", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768030791.0, "id": "1q8y2sj", "author": "That-Spare2071", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8y2sj/i_was_too_scared_to_say_yes_so_i_said_no/"}

Yes it might have turned out some other way, and I know it still pains but she's still here and you're still here and you guys haven't fallen off because of some reason, only a guy who made things bad between you. I'm not saying hope for something, you are likely in a better place now, you have learnt life, and if she's talking ask her how she is and what's going on with her, maybe meet and talk someday if she wants to.

(also english isnt my strongest)\n\nwhen i was around 6-7, my mom met this guy named paw (nickname) and he had 2 kids that were 1 and 2 years older than me and he conviced my mom to move out of the house we were living in to live with him. now, paw had mobility issues and well known health issues and he was sleeping on the floor of his living room because he was too big to simply go up and down the stairs, and his family would come and visit and would step over this man as he lied there basically dying and once my mom finally stepped into the picture and helped him out, so many doctors basically said if he were to still be in the position he was in, he wouldve passed away the way he was found. \n\nthey were together from around when i was in elemetary to when i was about to enter 7-8th grade (Roughly 2021-mid 2022). By that time me and my mom had experienced so many things, went through so much, but we made it out with each other. My mom offered multiple times to allow him (paw) to continue on forwars with us and to leave everything behind but he didnt listen and wanted to stay for some reason. after my mom left we got a new home, found new potentials, went through hardship (ofc), and so much more. we hadn't had anymore contact with Paw since we left but he would often message my mom talking about how he was always sorry about how he wouldnt make the right decisions and how he woukd wanna make himself better for her but she didnt fall for it at all.\n\nso now onto whats actually hurting me deep down. i know that this person has been in my life for pretty much childhood and my mom was dating him, but his family and 2 kids made me feel so unwelcomed.

Again, that’s okay, sex is sex - live your life. My problem is the fact that in the messages, she says “I’m sober, he was drunk as fuck though.” Come again? I’m sorry, what did you say? \n\nShe did not clarify whether or not she was drunk too. If she was not drinking, I am absolutely mortified. I have a bad past with that and have been taken advantage of both under the influence and sober, so for her to do that really hurts especially since she’s aware of what has been done to me. Besides my personal experiences, I think it is wrong to do in the first place because whoever is intoxicated is not in the right state of mind to be having sex with someone that is. \n\nNow, I could be jumping to conclusions with that one, but the other problem is if she was drinking, she drove them back to her place. It’s not new for her to get behind the wheel while intoxicated, she drives after smoking weed a lot (I do not support that at all), but now drinking and driving? With another person in the vehicle at that? I cannot look past it as again, I grew up around alcoholics who have gotten many DUIs in their lifetime, I’ve seen the consequences and losses that come from drinking under the influence.\n\nI am not trying to make anything about my personal experiences, it’s just what I think of when these things happen, but this time I’m honestly starting to spiral because how could my best friend do it? I’ve trusted her for so long just for her to do this? Again, I’m not expecting her to think about me at all, but she’s well aware of what this kind of stuff can do to a person and she still willingly did it. That is what bothers me, the fact that she did it to someone.\n\nI asked if she was sober or not during the act and she ignored it, only answering my other questions like his age and whatnot, so I know one of those scenarios are true and she doesn’t want me to freak out at her. I don’t know if I’m overreacting and making it about myself, but I can’t wrap my head around why she would do any of that to anyone, and to herself if she was driving drunk. \n\nTL;DR: My best friend either slept with someone super drunk while she was sober, or she was drinking and driving, and I don’t know if I can be friends with her anymore over it.

I hope this year it will get better", "text": "I had a pretty rough start to my young adulthood, but I’ll try my best to summarize it. When I was 17, I ran away from home and became homeless for a while because my parents didn’t accept that I was nonbinary, and their abuse made me want to leave.\n\nAfter I turned 18 and graduated from high school, I realized I couldn’t live on the streets any longer, so I went back to live with my parents. I went through a lot of trauma from being bullied for 12 years in school. When I turned 18, I started therapy, but it didn’t help much. At 19, I attempted suicide because I felt lost, scared of adulthood, and unsure of what I wanted to do with my life. Thankfully, the attempt failed.\n\nAfter that, I tried DBT therapy for six months, but I was eventually kicked out because I was too physically ill to attend regularly—I was battling an autoimmune disease and had a broken foot at the time.\n\nWhen I turned 20, I went to college but dropped out because my tutors weren’t helping me succeed. At 21, I tried college again, but I was homeless, which made it almost impossible to keep up, so I dropped out once more. The homeless shelter I was staying in wasn’t helping me get back on my feet, so I eventually moved back in with my parents for a while—but things got really bad again. My parents continued to be physically and emotionally abusive, so I left and became homeless again at 22.\n\nI still didn’t know what I wanted to do at that age, so I worked part-time jobs and kept going to therapy, though it didn’t seem to help, and I remained emotionally unstable as usual. Now, I’m 23 and have been living in a homeless shelter for almost a year. I’m hoping this year will be better than the last.\n\nI missed the deadline to go back to college in the spring, but I hope to enroll for the summer semester. I also plan to try DBT therapy again this year. I really want to become more productive, even while I’m homeless, because I feel like I’ve missed out on a lot during my young adulthood.\n\nIf you’ve read this, thank you.

Now, when I'm around 20, I had my second sexual experience - which I regret. \n\nFor my first time, It was a older friend of mine. He was around 15 years old. He was the oldest in our friend group, and was like a older brother figure to me. \n\nIt happened in his room. We were laying down on his bed, and our conversation was around porn. He started to show me porn. I was aroused. He then got on top of me, and he started to rub himself on me - I was aroused. I remember enjoying it. There was frotting (rubbing) and little oral. It was mostly non-penetrative sex. But he tried. I don't remember much from this first experience. But I do remember the feeling of being robbed of my first kiss at the time. \n\nAfter this encounter, it became a common occurrence whenever I was in his room. Few times, I deliberately  went into his room for this opportunity. That time I didn't know much about intimacy and sex. \n\nIt would start the same. He would come on top of me, remove my clothes, and started to rub. He would usually stop after he came. And he would leave the room to clean himself up, while I stayed in room, still rubbing by myself. I felt pathetic, and wanted more. \n\nThis happened for a couple of years - until it stopped.  \n\nMy second experience happened quite recently. All was same, except I was in a different place, and with a different person. This person was also like a older brother figure to me, and he was married. I went to stay at his home, because he was leaving the country. His wife had already left with his newborn. \n\nAfter drinking, we went to his room. We talked for a while. I began talking about collage and how hard it is talking and getting with girls. I went on and on, and he started to hug me. I didn't think much of it at that time. As it went on, I started to get uncomfortable. But eventually i got away and pretended to sleep. He was disappointed - i felt bad.\n\nI heard him moving, and when I opened my eyes I saw him on top of me. He started to rub on me - i remembered the same sensation when first experienced it when I was 11 years old with the other guy. I felt disgust, but I also remembered the pleasure. He asked if i wanted to continue - i said YES. \n\nHe proceeded to remove my clothes, and began doing it. He instructed me to get off the bed, and go on the floor. As I sat on the floor, I started to regret everything. But i didn't have the courage to stop him. I didn't want him disappointed. \n\nIt was same as before. I was being rubbed against another guy, and I had to give an oral. I hated it. But he wanted more. He started to penetrate me. I opposed it at first, and he seemed to have listened. \n\nBut when I was on my back, he came on top of me, and prevented me from getting up. He started to penetrate. It was painful. I started blackout, and dismissed my mind from the current situation i was in. I was lucky that he came early. So he wasn't able to penetrate me fully. \n\nHe went out of his room, to clean himself up. It was the same as before. I was on the floor. I tried rubbing myself, but i didn't get aroused. I felt miserable and pathetic. I went straight home the next day and closed myself in my room.\n\nHe is now out of my life, and busy starting his new life with his wife and his baby. Same as the other guy. Both of these guys were in the same friend group when we were little. And as my friend group grows smaller, I feel alone. I don't have many friends. Both of them were my only best-friends.\n\nI feel ashamed that I was even aroused from all of these sexual experiences. I think of myself as the victim, yet i was enjoying it? Now I'm very sensitive around the topic of intimacy. If I do find myself with a girlfriend or a wife in the future, I would be afraid of initiating any form of intimacy. I feel like I would be doing the same thing, I hated, to them. \n\nI hate this. I hate feeling aroused as i recall these events.

I know the right answer but why does it feel like such a security blanket letting go.\n\nI(31F) has been best friends with Anna (31F) since we met freshmen year in high school. We have always remained close despite me moving across the country 5 years ago. Before I moved I had distanced myself from Anna because she was very negative and critical of me all the time. I just stopped hanging out with her but remained in contact with her via groupchat with our other childhood friend, Beth. \n\nLast September, I flew to Texas for the first time since I moved in 2021. The plan was a girls week at Beths house-3hrs north of the town we grew up. I was flying in and Anna was driving...When it comes time for me to buy my plane tickets to Texas, Anna kept coming up with bogus excuses and doubts if she would be able to make it- as if we hadn't been planning our reunion all summer. I decide im going to visit Beth regardless if Anna comes or not. A week before my flight, Anna reluctantly confirms shes able to join us. I immediatly notice Anna has gained a lot of weight, hair is messy, dressed in a oversized hoodie and leggings(even in the texas heat). Anna has a history of depression but her apperance was alarming for the overall lack of effort put in to this special occasion of seeing each other for the first time in years. During the trip Anna was pretty typically herself except she did tell us that she would only be able to come for 2 days because she starts a new job...Day 2 of the trip Anna abruptly starts telling us goodbye and she needs to get on the road to go home. Whatever Beth and I say bye and keep the party going. The next week, Anna text us casually that shes flying to California to meet up with some gamer friends she met online.... Ever since this I havent said anything directly to Anna in our groupchat and do not respond either. Anna was stressing about money to drive 3hrs to hangout at her friends house with her girls but can easily fly to California for some randoms?? Anna not making seeing us a priority was really hurtful and I stopped giving a sht about staying in contact to be a supportive friend for her mental illness because of it. \n\nAnyway...Fast forward to now, I am in a really happy, new chapter of my life and I don't want anything draining or negative energy in my life. I just got married in October and I want to focus on creating the life we want. Me and my husband are taking a few months to do some traveling in Asia. I want to cut off everyone who doesnt understand why I want to travel and want to start a new life. I am more protective of my life and choosing people who choose me back. My childhood friends never left our small town and dont see the significance in traveling. They dont get me-to say the least they are very conservative. I am the opposite- we have legit nothing in common anymore. I want new friends and I always felt comfortable knowing Anna and Beth were always a call/text away so I admittingly didnt put in the effort to maintain new friends. I guess coming to the realization that I need to move on is hitting now that im married, in Asia, in a new career path, and freshly 31. I want to get rid of the things i feel are holding me back in order to make room for new friendships, opportunities, ideas, etc. \n\nDo you think it worth me announcing that I no longer see the value in our friendship or should I just quietly exit? \n\nThank you for reading my rant.

I'm 23 years old, I'm a woman, I live with my family, and my brother is only 11 years old. I was chilling on the couch, watching TV, it was around 11:30 PM or so. Usually, he's already asleep since around 7 PM, 8 PM at the latest, so I didn't even pay attention when I heard some strange noises coming from his room. I thought he was playing on his phone or something. But time went by, and I kept hearing sounds of videos, moaning, that kind of stuff... then I got suspicious and decided to go into the room to see what was going on. When I opened the door, girl... I froze. My little brother, 11 years old, naked from the waist down, touching himself and watching porn on his phone. I was in total shock, I couldn't even speak properly. I closed the door quickly, took a deep breath, and went back to talk to him. I sat on the bed, tried to stay calm (because yelling or freaking out would only make things worse) and told him that what he was doing wasn't right at that age, that he's still very young, that his body is changing but there's time for everything. I explained that masturbating isn't the end of the world, everyone does it one day, but that watching pornography at that age can be super addictive, mess up his head, create unrealistic expectations about sex and relationships. He ended up opening up and told me that it was his friends from school who showed him, that they exchange links on WhatsApp, talking about it at recess... holy shit, right? An 11-year-old exposed to all this crap already. I tried to teach him boundaries: I said that if one day he wants to watch some video again, to look for me, that I'll help him choose something less heavy or explain things. And I even said that if one day he wants to try something (like kissing someone or whatever), to talk to me first, that I'll guide him, protect him, not let him do stupid things with anyone. But now I'm here questioning myself like crazy: did I do the right thing? Was I too permissive? Should I have forbidden everything right away, taken away his phone, told my parents? Or did I mess up big time by offering to \"help\" if he wants to watch porn or try something?", "score": 0, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768041257.0, "id": "1q90wrw", "author": "irmoriel455", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q90wrw/i_found_my_11yearold_brother_watching_things_he/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "TW: Domestic Abuse: I Grew Up in an Abusive Home, and I’m Terrified It Will Cost Me the Life I Want", "text": "I have been holding this in for too long and I don’t know who else to tell so I am posting it here.\n\nI, 25F, have grown up in an abusive household all my life. My father was and still is emotionally, physically and mentally abusive—first towards all of us, but later on, now, just my mother. My brother and I have only a year’s gap between us so we have seen a lot of stuff together. On many other occasions, he has been caught in the act, both emotionally and physically, but as a south Asian woman, despite all this, my mother is just expected to “stay” because as per society (this includes our own family) “he provides for you and your kids, feeds you, clothes you and provides you a roof over your head.” Which I, for a fact, believe is absolute nonsense. If you are part of a brown/desi household, you will know exactly where I am coming from. A lot of things have happened in the past—a lot of fights, arguments, toxicity, drama, neglect, abuse and God knows what else. It is a rollercoaster. \n\nI have become pretty much numb over the years. In my teenage years, I used to feel everything so vehemently, and was always trying to “fix” every matter between my parents. I, as the eldest daughter, have this in my blood—the urge to treat things like a project and try to fix them; I have this inherent quality to be hotheaded and just keep giving and giving until it drains me. How stupid I was to think that my efforts and tears would matter to them—that a crying child, begging them to stop would make them throw hands and tend to her instead. Teenage was a very dark period of my life where everything was do or die, but mostly just die. It wasn’t anything serious, but my intention was pretty clear—that I wanted this life to end, for all this madness to just stop.\n\nI feel nothing but pity for my mother. She went against her entire family to marry this man, only for him to treat her like this. She still regrets it, every day, I can see it on her face. She has let herself go completely, especially after my grandfather’s (her father’s death) a couple of years back. She doesn’t dress up, doesn’t put on makeup, doesn’t dye her hair. She looks older than she is—and the fact that my father has not supported her at all during this time says volumes about him not only as a husband, but also as a person. Instead of comforting her, he has always thrown the death of her father in her face like an abuse.\n\nOver the years, I will admit, the physical abuse had stopped, until recently. There is no logic behind the supposed “arguments” they have. It’s not like I haven’t tried to talk to him (both calmly and angrily) that he can talk and argue all he wants, just not raise his hand at her—nothing was learned, never was, never will be. I have stopped trying to “fix” this whole ordeal. I am merely my mother’s unpaid therapist and a punching bag to just feel absolute shit to not be able to do something about it.\n\nIt is because of their relationship that I have seen over the course of my entire life, I had decided to never get married. It wasn’t until I met a wonderful man last year that I thought to myself, “God, I would want nothing more than to be his wife.”\n\n Things just changed in my heart, and all I knew was that I wanted a family with him. He takes care of me, loves me, cherishes me like I am the light of his life. \n\nOne day, while on the phone, I was crying and I expressed my household problems to him, waiting for judgement, yet, all I was met with was love and comfort—something I failed to find in the arms of my family. Love with them was always conditional—if I did what they asked me to, fulfilled the goals they expected of me, just become the best good daughter, love was guaranteed. \n\nWith him, it came naturally, like I wasn’t doing anything special to please him. Upon hearing all this, he told me how proud of me he was, and he was right here with me. I really do love him, so much so, I want to cry sometimes that how did I get so lucky with him.\n\nOur marriage talks are in progress, both of our families know about is, but I am worried—my childhood and all this mess will come to bite me in the ass, though this is something that is and always will be out of my control, it still makes me worried. What will his family think if they find out? I am so embarrassed and tearful just typing this. I don’t want my father’s deeds to come onto me. I don’t deserve this. What if because of all this, they don’t think I am a good fit for their son, as I come from such a background? My father’s side of the family is uneducated, as well. It makes me think what if this will cause a problem for me specifically? \n\nI have full faith in my partner that he will not let this happen, but still, my own concerns are eating me alive and I am rotting day by day. I drown myself in work and try not to come home—I have gym and other activities aligned in such a manner that I only have to come home and sleep.\n\nI don’t even know what I am trying to say anymore; this doesn’t feel like a home, it feels like a prison where I have timed breaths. I dream of starting my own family with my partner, but these concerns haunt me—what if he turns out to be the same as my father? What if I have to face my mother’s same miserable fate? What if my children have to go through all the things I did during my childhood?\n\nI don’t know. I **am so tired.**\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI grew up in an abusive household and became numb trying to survive it. My father still abuses my mother, and I feel powerless to protect her. I found real, unconditional love for the first time and want to build a family, but I’m terrified my past will follow me, define me, or repeat itself.

advantage of my willingness to harm myself.  \n  \nanyways. i was a very lonely child like genuinely this was why the first time i considered suicide was in my first grade classroom. i just didn't understand why everyone hated me so much, i was bullied A LOT and also bullied by my close family members. when i was around 10 i learned i could lie about things other people were interested in and make friends. this started a pattern of me lying just to be interesting. i honestly thought no one would care about me unless i lied and presented a different version of me.  \n  \nwhen i went to go visit him and his family i lied about so much stuff. i lied about my sexual history, my drug history, and how many followers i had on instagram because it impressed him. and i liked that. but then he started making advances. and i would reject his advances. then he would act like it was just a joke. he made repeated advances as well, and each time i rejected them and told him it was gross. its important to note before this point he just treated me like a family member he thought was annoying and didn't want to talk to.  \n  \nwhen i was like 15 something happened that made my self esteem drop. i felt a lot of shame and pain every day again but told no one. he moved to my country around this time. the advances began again.\n\nthe last time i told this story on here, there were people who said i had put a spin to victimize myself. i disagree. maybe its because they don't realize that i have felt dominated by others/unable to stand up for myself from an early age. and that i had been bullied for all of these years.\n\none way this manifested. when someone is mistreating me and they won't admit it, like in this situation, or gaslighting me saying their advances were a 'joke' after repeatedly making them, and then proceeding to mock me or make fun of me or body shame me in the same situation, idk what happens i get this itchy powerless feeling and my throat closes. and then i want to cry and this has happened before where i try to stand up for myself when someone is mistreating me and they won't admit it and i just end up crying. and they end up winning that situation further. whether you believe me or not, each time he did this i got the same painful itchy feeling.  \n  \na month after i turned 16, he came to stay with us. he would do things like come into my room and not leave when i asked him to. he continued to make advances/implications/jokes i would reject and then gaslight me saying it was a joke. i would get the same feeling of helplessness and shame each time. but obviously i never showed this  \n  \nthis time, we were in my room. he made another advance. a plan formed in my head and i pretended to enthusiastically agree. part of the reason i did this was just because i hated myself. the other part was that i would have evidence that all the times he made advances weren't just jokes. and that i could use this to hurt him in the future because now i had something more substantial than him making advances and then denying that he made them and then doing it again. which just made me feel anxious/helpless/crazy every time. in my mind, this would be painful but i could handle it and then i could just use it to hurt him further. in his mind, i enthusiastically consented and that is that.  \n  \ndefinately i was hoping he would realize this was wrong before i did it and stop the whole situation. but he never did. i gave him head and i was good at it too, because i wanted him to feel safe in what he was doing and then really get hurt/paranoid. i hated him and myself and wanted to mess him up. he was moaning and swearing. maybe my mom got the feeling something was up because like two minutes in she called us from downstairs. he immediately came in my mouth and i felt it hit the back of my throat like acid. remembering this feeling puts me in a state of distress/humilation to this day. i cried about it this morning and i have several times since it happened, knowing i will never be able to erase that feeling from the memory of my body. after he came i got up and puked it all out in into the toilet. up until this point i felt like i was winning/had power in the situation but as soon as this happened i understood i had been used, and i had let someone use me, i had harmed myself and allow myself to be harmed. and that even though i had willingly done this, i was still in going to be in pain/carry this memory with me for a long time  \n  \nafter, i immediately went to my room. he came with me. he told me that i shouldn't tell anyone what happened. he made another advance and i just stared at him. some days later, he left. i decided not to do anything about the situation and put it to bed. 6 months later i confronted him and he denied anything ever happening.  \n  \n3 years later i told my mom and his brother that something had happened. i told them that i had technically consented. my mom said that it was his mistake and my mistake and i agree. but i was the only one who was harmed- i did threaten that i would tell others when i confronted him and this messed him up for some time but genuinely hes okay now i can tell from his vibe. now hes successful and doing movies. i still remember the pain i felt when i understood that if i could have seen into the future and known what the actual feeling was like i never would have done it. again, i still have the memory of his cum hitting the back of my throat and just feeling so ashamed and disgusted with myself. this emotional memory, and the fact that i will never get any honest apology, or even just admitting that this happened, how i would be rude to him after this incident and he would ask why i was being rude like nothing happened, just makes me feel helpless the way i did before  \n  \nanyway that is my story think whatever you want to. i have told the truth from my side", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1,

They have the audacity to talk about a county of millions of people, most of which actually hate Trump and his regime (and news flash didnt vote for him) and many of which are doing things to try and stop this in a nonviolent way, and paint us all as facist cultist which couldnt be farther from the truth. They will never have any empathy for the normal people here until we are inmass dying in either a civil war or concentration camps and that has become incredibly clear over the last decade and especially this last year. If you are going to talk about American politics and you dont understand what gerrymandering is, the way our communities have been exploitated by billionaires that are both domestic and foreign, and how propaganda works then please for the love of god do more research before yapping this hateful bullshit. Its so easy to sit back and tell people to essentially go on suicide missions because we arent doing things fast enough for their liking when they have no skin in the game. We dont want people to die, we want to do this as peacefully as possible, these things take time especially when the country is as big as is it unfortunately. If you are genuinely interested and care about what is happening to the American people and why/how we got here I cannot recommend Dasia Sade on YouTube enough (especially the Privatization of Everything video).

People are figuring it out, but it's a slow process since we're new at this. Indivisible membership is surging, huge protests are happening weekly all over the country, and independent journalism is being supported at an unprecedented rate as millions of us are discovering that we can't trust our regular news sources anymore.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "I think a big part of the silence is that people who are ready for violence aren’t advertising it. \n\nThere’s realistically millions of Americans who would be willing to shoot a fed if they came onto their property.\n\nIt’s not unreasonable to think that if some people showed up to your house in an unmarked vehicle, claiming to be cops, with no badges, and no warrant and refused to identify or go away, you’d be inclined to shoot them, which is an understandable reaction regardless of where you are in your politics. \n\nBut there’s a big difference between being willing to defend yourself and your family, and go on the offensive on behalf of your community. \n\nThe biggest things in my opinion is that everyone is either not at that point of being fed up, or is morally opposed to violence as a solution. \n\nSecondly, there’s nowhere to direct that level of anger without raising a militia. \n\nIf you’re armed and ready to rebel, where do you go? You’re gonna go take it out on local police? People in your community? \nGo get shot by the national guard when you try to drive on a base? \nYou’re gonna leave your job and drive up to 3000 miles to march on DC alone? \nYou’re gonna take a rifle to a protest and escalate and endanger members of your community who share your anger? \n\nIt feels hopeless alone, and while you can legally and openly organize a peaceful protest, you cannot do that for an armed one. \n\n\nEDIT: past this point I’m just advocating for an armed left.\n\nAlso, a lot of people who are on the left side of the aisle are opposed to gun ownership. Which makes sense since the left is outright more educated, and the obvious solution to gun violence is to remove guns. That’s inarguable common sense. \n\nTwo common anti firearm talking points are, \n“What is your rifle going to do against a tank?” To which the answer is nothing. Your rifle should keep you protected from people while you attack politicians , or damage infrastructure like railroads and fuel depots. \n\nThe other one is “why do you need an automatic weapon to hunt, or how can you possibly need that for self defense?” \n\nWhich is just a gross misunderstanding of the point of the second amendment, which is specifically to be the final bulwark in a system of checks and balances on government power. \n\nA vast majority of scenarios which involve a firearm, no shots are fired because the threat of a gun is often enough to deter violence. \n\nThis can be scaled up too. If we had Switzerlands mandatory military service where you then keep your service rifle, and every household was armed, there would be way less incidents like yesterday. \n\nIn the modern day US, an armed populace that is willing to speak out against the government would go further to protect Americans than any other policy bar none, and again, likely with less bloodshed because the threat is in itself a deterrent because these people have names and addresses.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1767924689.0, "id": "nyiqcut", "author": "NoxiousVaporwave"}

Telling me and other Americans to stop Trump.  \n\nThis isn't a James Bond movie.   \n\nThe USA is millions upon millions of people across millions of miles.   The laws change based on which state lines you are in.    Our individual cities and counties get strangled via gerrymandering.  \n\nThe news here is heavily controlled.  With a large percentage only listening to their echo chamber and absolutely refusing to listen to any other points of view.   My inlaws are Fox watchers for example and my father in law will absolutely blow his stack if I challenge Fox narrative.      \n\nThe news will purposely not cover protests and other things done against Trump because Trump has and continues to attack the media that speaks out against him.   He drags them through courts and sues them for millions.   \n\nI watch independent media via YouTube but not everyone does. \n\nYes we have the second amendment.  But the guns a civilian can purchase do not stand a chance against us military fire power.  \n\nIn practice the second amendment is useless.

In many counties people speak out when their representatives go against them.  So now local reps refuse to hold town halls to speak with people.   They don't answer their phones and they don't show up to hear people out.    I've seen many of them literally run away rather than face people.  \n\nThe media in the USA is allowed to lie to us.   And they do.   The victim a few days ago was called a domestic terrorist on the news before her body was cold.   Without investigation.  \n\nTrump also wants us to act out.  If we did what people on reddit want us to do and ran out with guns, Trump would happily kill us all and declare martial law.  \n\nThey don't care if we die. \n\nI wish I was being dramatic.

From the people who harvested the resources to the people who cleaned, processed, and packaged them to the warehouse workers who organized, stored, and shipped them to the truckers who transported them. Then there's the architects, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, painters, and And AND!!! \n\nThis is probably true for almost everything you interact with. Your electronics, furniture, clothes, means of transportation. Plus in a society of this size you have justice departments, firefighters, public schools, healthcare, and other systematic safety nets in place. It's truly dizzying to try to think of how many people make one's life possible in these societies. \n\nDespite this, however, there's an ✨️ illusion ✨️ of the individual. Every man is an island and all that stuff. We live in homes that are increasingly spread out, our opportunities to gather regularly with our local communities shrinks, and our society tells us that we must carry all of our troubles completely on our own, lest we be a leech. A burden. WEAK. \n\nThis is why soooooooo many people across the globe - NOT just single men - are lonely. We only developed brains this advanced and complex because of our social systems that allowed us to make incredible advancements over time.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "I was making a connection between a modern complaint / issue of humans and a very basic, well-understood anthropological concept. \n\nThe most classic comparison you'll hear in an intro to anthropology class - and most published papers on the topic - is hunters and gatherers vs farmers. Hunters and gatherers live in small, tight-knit communities with very few members. Despite their physical proximity to every member of their community every single day, they typically have the skills to fully support themselves without help from said community. Farmers, however, are much more dependent on each other. Each property can only support so many resources, and so it takes multiple properties collaborating together to have a healthy, thriving society (fields of grain, orchards, pastures and livestock ranches, lumber plantation, cotton fields, etc). Plus if one farmer loses all their crop / product, they by themselves probably wouldn't make it. It's the entire, interconnected system that sustains everyone. But agriculture takes a lot of room, so even though it's a house of cards where everyone is reliant on one another for success and SURVIVAL, there's only one family per 5 square miles! \n\nI AM personally of the belief that the US obsession with the individual exaccerbates this to a wild degree, but I think it's a little unfair to ignore the point here about how this is, to a certain extent, simply a natural result of the size and \"complexity\" of a society and say that I'm not considering the big picture.

Those are specific structural factors, not just “complexity.”\n\nAnd we can see this clearly when we look at collectivist societies. If loneliness were simply a product of \\*Western individualism\\*, like you're emphasizing, then collectivist cultures should be relatively immune. But Japan, South Korea, China, and India are all experiencing major loneliness spikes, in some cases worse than the U.S. The causes tend to be things like urbanization, economic pressure, shrinking family structures, and technology.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I was the person in the friend group everyone secretly hated", "text": "I just learned that I was that person in the friend group that nobody liked or wanted around. I never even noticed. Until they completely blindsided me and kicked me to the curb. Only one of them bothered to say goodbye. One. Out of nine. \n\nUnless you count the one who said we could be acquaintances instead of friends. Hah. Thanks. I don't think I'll take you up on that. \n\nTurns out they never liked me because I had issues crossing their boundaries, talking about things that would make them uncomfortable. Did anyone ever tell ME this? No, of course not. Just each other. It's easier to talk shit behind a person's back than it is to talk to them, isn't it? Than it is to ask them to change?\n\nI would've tried, if I had known I needed to.\n\nThe hardest part is the lack of closure, of knowing that I'll never get to talk to them and ask how much of this fragile little friendship was real. If any of it was. It had to be, right? They talked to me, reached out to me, engaged with me, invited me to things. You don't do that with people you dislike. \n\nThat's what I thought, anyway. Maybe it's different for them. Maybe they just pitied me so much that it allowed them to put up with me for as long as they did. I wish I could ask. I wish I could know.\n\nI don't think I'm very good at picking up on social cues, because I'm sure there were signs I never noticed. Maybe shared glances amongst each other whenever I started talking, looks of disgust in my direction, pulling away when I spoke. I'm sure it was all very obvious to them, since they thought it was enough for me to notice without them ever saying a word. But I was too lost in the fun I thought we were having together to ever notice. Fun I was having by myself in a room full of people with smiles that never reached their eyes.\n\nI wish I could know how long this has been going on behind the scenes, their disgust for me festering behind laughter we shared together. Laughter that meant so much to me, but nothing to them. How long had they been wishing for my absence? Were they looking for ways to be free of me, to be rid of me, while they actively invited me out to eat? If so, why bother inviting me? Had it been happening for longer? While we partied together, played games together, while they ate the food we cooked together? Did they think I was just as filthy then as they do now? \n\nI wish they'd just told me sooner, the moment they felt it, so maybe it wouldn't have hurt quite so bad. They never wanted me to change, that was never an option, they only ever wanted me gone. And I would've left at any time. I just like to think it would've hurt less had it happened back then instead of now.\n\nThere was one in particular, “Magdalene,” who I was friends with before the rest. Her refusal to give me a word before blocking me on everything is what hurts the worst. I would've preferred hatred or disgust, because that's so much better than apathy. But no. I was given nothing. All those years of friendship meant so little to her that I couldn't even get one last little message, one last little farewell. Did she hate me as much as the rest, for as long as the rest? Longer? Did she feel that aching pit of dread every time she saw a message was from me, knowing she had to respond out of some sense of obligation? Did she pretend to enjoy every conversation, share every interest, just to amuse me? Amuse herself? Was it loneliness? Pity?\n\nI can't for the life of me understand, and I know I never will. She's never going to talk to me again. She doesn't want to. She doesn't have to, because it's her choice. She chose to do this to me. She's fine with hurting me. She is so okay with the prospect of hurting me that she did it with almost no hesitation at all.\n\nWow. Putting it like that, I realize how worthless I really am to her. I know there's no accounting for emotions, but it sure makes me feel stupid for feeling so sad that she's left me.\n\nI hope they learn how to communicate in the end. Or maybe I don't. It'll be more vindicating for them to do to each other what they did to me. To let their hatred and disgust fester under the guise of friendliness until it becomes so much that they find a new target to turn on, one after the other, until there's no more mob left to share their mentality.", "score": 84, "num_comments": 31, "created_utc": 1767949541.0, "id": "1q83i4c", "author": "SadisticRainbows", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q83i4c/i_was_the_person_in_the_friend_group_everyone/"}

This is not to say Renee Nicole wasn't a good person, just that we shouldn't focus on her being a parent as being some sort of saving grace for her character. You can totally be a parent and still be a terrible person.  \n  \n  \n  \n2. When stopped by law enforcement, you have a legal obligation to comply. You can ask the officer why you are being stopped and even declare you don't consent to being searched, but simply fleeing is a bad decision. I don't think that ICE agent can claim self-defense; at most I think they can indicate Renee was resisting arrest and possibly obstructing justice, neither of which warrants the use of a firearm though.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1767892881.0, "id": "nyfkugr", "author": "CobaltOmega679"}

The one job she has above every cause, every protest, every headline, is getting home to her kids.\n\nAnd what is she doing instead?\n\nShe’s 500 miles from home, in the street, in her car, blocking federal agents who are doing their job. Not alone! Her partner is right there filming her like this is some brave little documentary moment. Around them: whistles blaring, people yelling, pure chaos, manufactured chaos, so agents can’t do their lawful duty.\n\nHer window is down. She hears the orders. She understands the orders. She ignores the orders.\n\nThen she puts the car in reverse.\n\nStill doesn’t comply.\n\nThen she puts it in drive, NOT park! She moves forward into the agent. \n\nThat’s not “confusion.”\n\nThat’s not “panic.”\n\nThat’s decision after decision after decision.\n\nNow put yourself in the agent’s shoes for half a second. A driver is already in an unlawful act! refusing commands in a hostile, chaotic scene, and now that driver uses a vehicle to move toward you. You get a split second. You don’t get the luxury of “Maybe she’s just stressed.” You have to assume the worst, you have to think of protecting other people like the partner at ther window, because if you assume the best and you’re wrong, you don’t go home or someone else. \n\nSo the agent fires after she makes an intentional and aggressive move toward him, because he has no idea what her intentions are, and she just demonstrated she’s willing to escalate.\n\nNow… imagine her three kids. At school. Sitting there like any other day. Not knowing their mother is out playing street-hero games for criminals in the middle of a work week, with the two adults reaponsible for them!\n\nShe didn’t think about them.\n\nShe didn’t think, “If I get arrested, who picks my babies up?”\n\nShe didn’t think, “If I get hurt, who raises them?”\n\nShe didn’t think, “If I die, they have nobody.”\n\nShe thought about protecting criminals.\n\nShe thought about interfering with federal agents.\n\nShe thought about the camera.\n\nShe thought about the crowd.\n\nShe thought about the moment.\n\nThere is no amount of evidence, money, tears on TV, or news spin that can make this make sense.\n\nAs a mother: NOTHING about this makes sense.\n\nAt minimum, she knew her actions could get her arrested. At minimum. And she still chose it. She chose strangers. She chose chaos.

Something about concentrating on Tetris for a few hours after something traumatic seems to help with processing it in a healthier way. \n\nStill get therapy, though. It's okay to ask for help from a professional - especially when you've seen something involving kids. At one point in my life, I wanted to go into computer forensics to help put child abusers away. One of the requirements was that as an examiner, you had to go to therapy at least once a year due to the things you see on people's computers. The first time I saw something involving a child out in the wild, it fucked me up. I reported it to multiple agencies, cried, and was NOT okay for a very long time. That made me realize that I'm not cut out for that line of work, and I'm thankful for those who are strong enough to deal with the worst of society every day so that those kids can one day have a better life.\n\nHell, seeing posts like this brings back those memories, so I'm probably going to do some self-care when I'm done writing this. Tetris and ice cream sounds really good right about now.\n\nIt's always okay to ask for help if you need it. It doesn't make you weak.

Unfortunately I have vast experience with.living with someone dealing with traumatic loss, the murder of his brother, death of his mother, death of his sister and death of our son. The trauma of seeing me bleed out and need fluid resuscitation. And being a firefighter seeing people dead, with missing limbs, with non recoverable injuries but having to still cut them out of cars so that they can die in an ambulance.\n\nMy information about eye movement treatment comes from fact based evidence and a vast amount of experience. Playing tetris literally only works if you have no emotional involvement in what you've seen, if you do it within the first 6 hours and after that the neuropathways of setting your visual input becomes permanent. Its in your brain and playing a game cannot remove that. So, if you see something that's disturbing but doesn't affect you at all then playing tetris will help you to desensitise those images. Because they are just images and have no bearing on your life at all.\n\nTelling someone who has had to systematically remove every part of a vehicle while a driver is screaming in pain and the air ambulance is next to you waiting to take that person, who will die if you apply the wrong pressure at the wrong time, that playing a game will remove or help them process what they have gone through is ineffective, untrue and dangerous. \n\nIt works sometimes, in loose cases where someone has seen something awful. But actually, in real life where people experience actual real life or death trauma, it has limited applications and would never, ever be advised by emergency services employers to help with trauma. \n\nI literally cannot imagine any place in the police, ambulance or fire service where the aftercare from a fatality would be 'play tetris, you'll feel better'. They don't because it's not true. The treatment for viewing and helping to prevent traumatic death is counselling.\n\nEdited typos.

I do apologize if this is a bit long winded.\n\nI should be happy, everything is improving so much. I’m finally losing the weight and improving physically, which not only has me at the lowest weight in 3 years but has me beaming with confidence, all so I’ll be ready to leave for enlistment, I’ve been working at this for months and it’s all finally coming together, the paperwork is done and I’m all set to leave in 2 months. \n\nI’m finally stress free with my finances, I have everything figured out and I’m no longer drowning the same way I was the past few months. \n\nI got my dream car, a mustang which while may not have been the smartest purchase has been the biggest win I’ve had so far and genuinely make me happy. \n\nI even met a girl, someone who genuinely makes me smile everytime I hear from her, someone who lights up my day and I’ve actually been able to connect with, even with topics I was always scared to be open about, even with the closest friends I had in my past. \n\nI’ve become way more outgoing and confident, no longer the anti social, pessimistic and introverted person I was before, I can make friends now, I can hold up a conversation without judging myself and I no longer dread human interaction.\n\nMy life has improved so much in the past 3 months and yet I’m not happy, I know why, the same reason why I even started working so hard towards all of this, because I lost my second half. The girl I thought I would love for the rest of my life, my twin flame, my soulmate, the person I genuinely thought I would spend the rest of my life with. \n\nI’m not grieving the same way I did when it was fresh. It doesn’t burn my soul and leave an empty void when I think about her anymore. I don’t regret every action I’ve ever taken when I look back at our relationship, I don’t cry anymore when I try to sleep and recognize the emptiness I feel when I roll and realize she’s not there anymore. She’s not the first thing I think about when I wake up nor the last when I go to sleep like so many nights before. I’ve accepted that we’ve ended and I’m trying with all my might to move on, and I have, and so has she.\n\nWe’re still good friends, we each couldn’t just leave each other completely, we tried and it broke us, it returned me back to a state of looking for a release from all the pain something to my drown sorrow in and it did the same for her, we both started drinking, heavily. But it relaxed once we reconnected, we had always talked about staying friends if things ever went wrong, we didn’t want to hate each other, we didn’t want to hate ourselves. And so we started talking again.\n\nWe had our fun, I will admit we did things that I regret, we sunk back into our old ways and became closer physically than we had any right being after we broke up, especially after she started talking to her now boyfriend, who at the time she treated like a side piece, someone we actively talked down, who we snuck around and kept our relationship a secret from. I will admit it had a charm to it but it also made me feel extremely guilty. I think it got to her too, because we finally stopped and I don’t want to start again, part of me just wants to be rid of her completely, as harsh as it sounds, I just want to let that chapter of my life close, but I just can’t let go.\n\nIt’s so easy to dismiss her when we’re apart, I can distract myself, but when we’re in person it’s like a pull neither of us can resist, we go back to the way we were, make each other smile in ways only we would know how, we laugh, we joke, we tease, we let our guards down in a way only those who’ve truly laid out there entire souls can. And yet we both know it’s not what we want, we both want to move on, I want to move on.\n\nAnd the problem I face now is I am, I’m moving on and I feel even guiltier than when we were messing around behind her bfs back. Every text I receive from my new girl lights up my heart in a way only she had before, and yet it’s such a bittersweet moment before I realize that spark had been gone from the two of us for so long and I just didn’t want to admit it. That I had been so unhappy with the girl I “loved” that our texts became a chore for me, that her coming home was an annoyance and a distraction from what I wanted to do. That this final breakup was our third to date and just proved how much we should’ve ended things sooner. We both did things we regret to each other, we both hurt one another in ways only we could’ve, and yet we stayed because we felt such an overwhelming connection. \n\nAnd yet with every text, with every celebration, with every happy moment I have as I move on, I ask myself why couldn’t I feel this way about her, why did I have to let my ego get in the way, why did she have to hurt me the way she did, why isn’t she the one I’m sharing these moments with, why did we need to split apart. Questions I know the answers too, that I logically should be fine with, that before this point I was emotionally okay with too. \n\nYet with everything going so well, it still eats at me, that I want to start a new chapter of my life, that I finally want to live again, but for myself, a trait I had long since lost, however I cant do it without feeling like I’m betraying the love I had for her even though by now that love is long since gone. A remnant emotion not even I can spark a light again, even with how much I miss her and the desire I hold to hold her in my arms again. It’s simply gone, I don’t love her anymore not in the same way I did before, and yet I still find myself irresistibly attracted to her, like I need to be whole again and she’s the piece I’m missing.\n\nI know this will all eventually pass, that I’ll be happier once I start the goal I’ve been working so hard to get to, and yet I’m fearful for the results, because I know she’s still gonna write, that her letters will still be something I have to open and respond to, and I’m anxious at the thought of my reaction. \n\nI don’t know what I expect as a response to this, it’s long winded and contradictory and yet that’s the battle I face internally, that the things I know are true and the feelings I have are at war with each other, a long winded and twisted battle filled with contradiction and confusion, all while I try to accept my happiness as something I deserve and try to help her reach that same level of happiness so I don’t feel guilty for feeling better than she does even if I know she doesn’t feel the same way.\n\nTLDR\nI broke up with my long term girlfriend months ago, and I’m finally moving on and improving my life yet I’m still not happy, trapped in a though process that my happiness is a direct thing to feel guilty of in comparison to hers.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768034861.0, "id": "1q8z6xc", "author": "IcyHotAlt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8z6xc/i_just_dont_know_anymore/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I'm a mess. I've tried everything. What do I do now?", "text": "I try to think of myself as a very self-aware person. I used to constantly break my back to please people when I was younger. My mind was constantly filled with memories of old embarrassing conversations and if I said or did the right thing to people and at the end of the day, I knew there was barely any of \\*me\\* left. I didn't really know who exactly I was but I did know that I was a bit weird. Throughout all the schools i went to, I was constantly excluded and bullied. Then in 7th grade, my dad died. From then on, I became more into myself and I started adopting a mindset of \"f them if they don't like me\" and \"I don't need anyone to do anything; do everything for you by yourself.\" Whenever I remembered an old conversation that would've made me embarrassed, it made me feel angry instead (Almost like in a defensive way)I stopped playing my sport, defected from my churches, and stopped drawing because I recognized that I didn't really want to engage in those things, my mom wanted me to do them and people around me wanted it for me more than I ever did.\n\nSeeing me \"lose\" interest in things I \"liked to do before\", my mom thought I was unhappy and depressed. I couldn't understand why she couldn't see this is \\*me\\*. While I started this journey to find myself, I don't think the real me is whats best for me. I lie uncontrollably and I wronged people left and right. I recognized this as I matured and corrected my behaviors and took accountability for my actions. I was getting better. I found I really like piano and a genre called BL and I became more confident in myself. But something plagues me.\n\nIt's like this noise in my head that won't quiet. At first, I could eat food and it would go silent but now it doesn't quiet even when I eat. My body feels good but my mind doesn't. Then routinely cutting myself everyday + whenever I was experiencing emotions I didn't want to face made it stop for a short while but then the noise persevered even while I was bleeding on the cold tile floors. All while I struggled more and more to go to sleep and stay asleep as night. It feels like this insomnia is consuming me as this static festers, getting louder and louder. And when I do manage to fall asleep, I'm plagued by vivid and horrifically violent dreams where this noise/voice is amplified. I've described these nightmares to dream interpreters and a lot of them said I could be on the verge of experiencing an \"ego death\".\n\nThere's something brewing in me that I just don't know which confuses me because I've always thought myself to be very self aware. And without answers, I could only focus on quieting my mind. I became addicted to scrolling and pornography. I would go back and forth between tiktok, instagram, and twitter. The doom scrolling would make me feel like shit once again while it did numb me. I hated the way it made me feel and I totally ruined the tenderness of pleasure--it kills my mood--so I moved on to listening to music...all the time. And then reading...all the time.\n\nNow that I read with my blasting headphones pretty much all the time, I don't have time for other people. This year, my spotify wrapped said I listened to about 177,000 minutes (around 121 days) and I hit 300 read books a month or two again. I've just gone through so many addictions, I'm worried this behavior will repeat with something even more harmful in the future.\n\nI made this post because slowly, the music I blast hasn't been enough and I'm finding less and less books that are engaging enough for my particular taste. I've become a bit of a recluse. I just sit around reading and listening to music and organizing my computer layout while I sink deeper and deeper. I hate the light- any light whether its my computer light, room light, or the sun light. I feel the best in the dark now.\n\nI went through all this addictions and I've got nothing to show for it. I never solved or even figured out my problem. Ironically, I think by trying to find myself, I made things worse and now I'm a mess. I'm just so tired of laying in my bed every night with this emptiness and disquiet.

It devolved more and more to them attempting to evict me by calling the lease manager and the fucking police.\n\nanother friend that was supposed to replace something they had broken from me, stopped talking to me altogether because of these rumors. \n\nthe loss of control over me sent them into madness. i have never heard her best friend scream so loud through the door.\n\nconstant harassment, judgement, bullying, banging on the door,  etc. \n\nthe weirdest part is that i noticed throughout all of the insults they threw at me, they were projecting. giving me this dreadful feeling and a wave of sadness. \n\nthey would listen to me through the walls (i think they still do), go through my room when i was gone, touch my stuff, somehow got into my car and smoked, messed with my car right side mirror, threw a milkshake at my car, spit on the driver window, and much more.\n\nfor 2 more weeks it continued non stop.\n\neventually dying out when they couldnt shake me. from the start until now, i have locked my door every time i come home, i never say a word to them, and i focus on myself until i can get out of here. they seemed to HATE that. so i guess they eventually realized they were fighting themselves.\n\nevery other week they would basically ask me to leave and break my part of the lease, up until now. Now the lease is being broken altogether.\n\n  \nMy Thoughts:   \nthe entire thing was a recipe for disaster. i should have known that her best friend would be exactly like she is. her best friend has a girlfriend too, and that girl has no idea what she does behind her back.  \n  \nThis happened months ago, I tried to get the police involved with them tampering with my mail and touching my car, but they told me to focus on myself.   \n  \nthe emotions I went through were so unstable that I cant really remember much, but immediately after breaking up with her, my chest pain never came back so i knew i did something right after all. \n\nfrom there ive been moving upwards, better personality (I CAN TALK TO RANDOM GIRLS!!!), funnier jokes, etc.\n\nalso fun fact, i think because i was in survival mode for so long my reflexes and reaction time have increased like crazy, and the confirmation of my concerns proved im not a dumb person. I figured them all out, and now i understand who they are. Theyre apparently afraid of me even though i havent done a thing, if that says anything. \n\nThanks for reading, stay safe because demons are real, they're just very pretty.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768015737.0, "id": "1q8tcef", "author": "Mission-Enthusiasm73", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8tcef/living_with_my_ex_girlfriend_and_her_bestfriend/"}

We started off as friends, with both sharing many similar interests. I fell for him soon after meeting because I felt comfortable around him and I have never had anyone interested in me before (never have been in a relationship before).\n\nWe talked all the time and at the end of the year I asked him out (we'd been talking for about 5 months and I was tired of waiting for him to do it) and he straight up ignored me, but he later told me that he was too busy to currently be in a relationship and I was hurt, but I understood. Time skip to November of our sophomore year, right when my feelings for D  disappeared and I only thought of him as a friend, he asked me out. He apologized for ignoring my confession in May and that he now had free time to date, however I told him no, but he kept pushing it and so I told him I would think about it - I ended up rejecting him again the next day (I felt really bad about this).\n\nI hoped to go back to being friends with him, so I acted almost the same as before, because he was a good friend and I really don't have many of those (I have trouble talking to other people), but that was a mistake. At the end of the year, D confessed to me again and I rejected him once again. This is when I started to try and ignore him.\n\nAfter his second confession I no longer felt comfortable around him, and I actually felt incredibly uncomfortable around him. At the start I would take a long time to answer his messages and now I just put him on silent and answer in short replies. And in the new school year I was hoping to never see him again, however we keep getting put in the same classes (from our freshman year to now our senior). Whenever he comes by to talk I first act like I can't hear him (AirPods in) then answer in short replies. I just can't stand to be near him anymore, I just feel sick and I don't know why. One of things I hate most is when he looks over my shoulder and at my phone - he once asked who I was texting and about what.\n\nI just want to cut him out of my life but because I have to see him until I graduate, I feel bad for blocking him because I don't want to confront me about it.\n\nSorry for the rant", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768028100.0, "id": "1q8xble", "author": "ObjectiveCustomer747", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8xble/i_feel_bad_for_ignoring_the_guy_i_used_to_be/"}

I think the rule of thumb when we had ours (similarly close to the same age as you - I was 27, husband was 29) you waited a YEAR before you made any marital decisions. Especially “fixing” anything — nothing is necessarily broken, you just have a 10 month old.\n\nI will say, your partner has to be some level of receptive for this next piece but me and my partner made a rule that what was said at 2 AM stayed at 2 AM. We both have tempers, so this rule really helped us survive. (Our kid had colic and then constant ear infections - it was brutal)\n\nFinally, for the intimacy piece, PLEASE give her time. Don’t make her tell you she’s tired. She’s exhausted mentally and doesn’t have the bandwidth to meet your needs on top of the screaming infant (there’s a hint of projection in there, don’t take it personally).

Intimacy is a complicated subject, and at the risk of sounding sexist I understand that men have needs - but right now, esp if she is still breast feeding, you need to prioritize hers.

I don’t fully understand why, and that’s been one of the hardest parts.\n\nI never stopped wanting to socialize or go out, and I’ve tried not to let my disability define me.

That night, I noticed he, his sister, and a few other friends got together to celebrate, but I wasn’t invited.\n\nMy girlfriend of two years hasn’t asked to spend time with me once in the past year. We see each other maybe once every two months, and only if I initiate. If I don’t reach out first, she doesn’t call or visit.\n\nI thought I made a new friend last week.

By fucking up as a teenager! If you’ve never dated AT ALL as an adult you’re not gonna know how to all of a sudden just because you’re older. Older people know because they are older and have years under their belt not just their age! If you’re 26 and never had any job you’re not just gonna automatically know how to do said job! If you’ve had years of experience in retail at 26 and now you’re working at Michael’s of course you’re going to know what to do you’ve done it before!\n\nBeing a bumbling idiot at romance and sex at 16 is a whole other deal than at 26!!!!

It is not fun learning to date as an adult!!!!!\n\nAnd fucking sex I know it’s going to be bad that’s another one people say sex is bad when you’re young that’s because you’ve never fucking done it!!!

That’s not fucking fun to experience as an adult!!!!!\n\nIt’s so fucking frustrating! People who say this don’t know how crippling it is as an adult not knowing how to interact romantically trying to learn when most people at this age except you to know!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "My gf is ignoring me after a fight with my ex (extremely long story)", "text": "Okay, this account was basically dead until now and I'm just so stressed out with everything going on so basically you all get the whole story.\n\nLast month, sometime in December, I had got back into contact with one of my Exes. Let's call him O. During our relationship he was extremely abusive in every way, on substances, etc etc. Mind you we were Freshman (in HS) at the time. We had talked on and off since, but since he was into drugs he had assaulted me more. The reason I went back is because he said he was quitting, which in the end was a complete lie... but regardless.\n\nHe ends up introducing me to his friend group, we had some mutual friends which was nice and I made some new ones along the way. One stood out to me in particular, we will call her D for simplicity as well. D was gorgeous, funny, sarcastic in the exact type of way I could understand, I was secretly smitten and we started talking and flirting quick after meeting. O caught onto this and within 3 days of knowing eachother... asked me if I like D saying that she liked me back. Of course I was honest, said that I did like her kinda but was still unsure. He then took this as the chance to put us all in a gc, tell us to fuck, and then pressure us to get together.\n\nI was mortified. D was too understandably. I remember texting her and profusely apologizing, but she did like me too but wanted to take it slow. But she did tear into O for outing me like that with no basis on her end. D said something about how she wanted to take it slower and not rush relationships as that doesn't go well for her... and O took that in offense as he and his current partner dated within a day. D and O blocked eachother, made up, whatever.\n\nA week later, I'm consistently talking to D and having genuinely an amazing time... when I get a sudden text from O. O confessed he still liked me, and I didn't know how to respond. Did he ask his current partner? Did they break up? All those things crossed my mind; but I rejected him for my own sanity. I was really shocked and so I told D because we were romantically talking at the time, to O's knowledge that we liked eachother. Commence another fight. But it dropped quick.\n\nFast forward to Dec 30th. I have a dissociative disorder and was pretty blurry at the time, to O's knowledge. He was high. I was talking about my disorder when he made a joke and ended it with \"fuck you\" and so I replied in a JOKING way, \"not rn\" as most people in our friend group would have responded. But he took that personally and all of a sudden started whining about how horny he was, flashed me himself shirtless, and then tried to pressure me into sending back. I admittedly was going into my fawn-defense mechanism and just politely rejecting and making excuses... all of that, and managed to get him off of me.\n\nI woke up that next morning and told D, and she was rightfully pissed. O not only tried to get me to cheat on her, but also O tried to cheat on a partner of his own with the excuse of polyamory. D and O got into a huge fight, understandably so. I was too scared to defend myself before, hence all the other times I have been assaulted. D in defense decided we were dating now, and so that's how it happened. O threatened to turn the friend group on me, saying I didn't belong, calling my now gf a t-slur and an f-slur, and calling me pathetic and that my other friend is gonna hate me for this. I ended up pre-emptively messaging some friends and D and I showed them the screenshots, including O's partner. They all sided with me, though O's partner didn't break up with them.\n\nA few days ago, O texted from his partner's phone, blocking D in disguise. I was confused as O then texted me and saying I was a good person for his partner and to stay friends. I was so confused. When O's partner, J, got their phone back... D was understandably upset. Someone she wanted no contact with broke it so easily. D went off the rails on J, pressuring them to break up with O (which I agree with in some ways, O is controlling and an abuser) I was terrified of this as I HATE conflict due to trauma and whatnot. J messaged me something for D and I sent it to her, and more shit went down because of it... and J and D are no longer speaking and I can't help but presume it was my fault.\n\nI deleted the message I sent to D from J... as I was panicking. D asked why I deleted it and I admitted that it was because my anxiety was really bad. And since then, she hasn't spoken to me. I have sent a few texts since then, today being the only day I didn't in case she needed space. But I'm really scared of being abandoned again. She lives in Europe and I live in the U.S. so there is a big time-difference though we have made it work.\n\nShould I try and talk to her and make this work? I don't wanna be pushy, but I know things are hard for her. I just can't help but feel like I am a bad luck charm wherever I go now. I always have been and always will be.

I had a nice apartment, my dream car, hell i even saved up enough to buy my favorite pistol(i live in the south), a custom 1911(yes yes tell all the boomer fudd jokes you want). \n\nBut i was unfulfilled. I found the job boring and the hours were long. I frequently was working 10-12 hour days, my sleep, mental, and physical health were all degrading fast. So i looked into what else i could do. I remembered a friend of mine who always talked about teaching english abroad. For him his dream country was japan. For me it was israel or hong kong(please refrain from political debates on this thread. Not interested in stirring up controversy). \n\nI ended up choosing Hong Kong for safety reasons and because ive always wanted to train wing chun kung fu. I even had a friend there i met when i studied abroad, so it all seemed to work out really well. So i study hard, get my tefl certification, and apply to any company that would have me.\n\nI just wanted out. This is when i ran into a company that i will name, Monkey Tree ELC. Now this is the one thing that isnt my fault. Monkey Tree(MT), is one of the most notoriously corrupt after school learning centers in the world. They routinely refuse to pay you a full paycheck that was agreed upon by both parties in the employment cintract. They offer apartments for you to stay in, that are dirty and falling apart, and when something breaks in that apartment, you are expected to pay for it.\n\nThey over charge you for rent, in my case $1200 usd a month to stay with 2 roommates. Insane even by hong kong standards. They barely train you for the classroom and frequently give contradictory orders like \"make the class fun but also acadmeic\" \"stick to our teaching schedule to a tee, but also play games.\" \"Its important to sell the course and that the kids enjoy class, but also dont allow them to speak, laugh, or raise their voice above a low murmur.\" And to top it all off the company culture if rife with racism, conformity, and gaslighting. Those who stand up for themselves, like myself, are frequently smacked back down. \"Dont like your pay? Well it isnt our deductions that are the problem. You're just bad with money.\" \"Dont like our racist comments? Well why are you offended, your not really asian. Your american.\" \"Want clarity from management? You americans are so entitled.\" \n\nOverall, i apologize for the long post. But essentially leaving my stable corporate job just left me poor, frustrated, and now jobless as i had to return to america, being unable and unwilling to enable this poor treatment. Now with that approximately year long gap in my resume, doing a job that is known to be abused by travelers as a paid vacation, what company will hire me? Who would want a worker who has been out of the loop for a year now and is a potential risk? I left one company before to go live out my instagram fantasies, in the eyes of an employer, what stops me from doing so to them? \n\nIt all goes to show that im being punished for my arrogance. I arrogantly thought i was the main character and didnt have to work a 9-5 like everyone else. But the traditional path exists for a reason, because its the path that works best of the majority of people. I shouldve been thankful for the success that God gave me instead of thinking i deserve more. Now i dont know if ill ever dig myself out of this hole im in. \n\nThere were some good things that came out of hong kong, i did get to learn wing chun, at ip man's school. I did get to, barely, see my old friend and make new ones. And dating as an asian man was much better in asia than it is here and i met some amazing women over there, who i am either still involved with or friends with now. \n\nBut overall, it still wasnt worth it. Im a man now not a teenage boy. I shouldnt uproot my life just because i like martial arts and beautiful women who are more likely to be attracted to me because i match their beauty standards more closely. Being a man is about survival, doing what you must to get ahead. And ive done a hell of a job at that.\n\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768002822.0, "id": "1q8oihn", "author": "hwarangma27", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8oihn/ruined_my_life_and_career_with_tefl/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I hate my boyfriend and I’m cheating on him.", "text": "I know how bad this is, and I know I’m a bad person okay. I’m not excusing my actions or saying what I’m doing is okay at all but you need to know some things.\n\nFirst thing is that this relationship is more like a disaster ship, once again I got rushed into a relationship too soon and now I’m trapped. If you look at my post history you’ll probably find another post of mine regarding a boyfriend of mine, this may offer perspective into the way my relationships go and the kind of men I date. Secondly some insite into my current boyfriend (M18) is loud, aggressive, sassy, and lacks common sense, this really overstimulates me  (F16) who has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and adhd along with a few medical issues that cause me physical pain daily is obviously bothered by this and his other actions.\n\nThird I’m going to tell you out of everything he has done In the last few months, the worst thing he did has to be the time he got drunk at my friends party, hit me, embaressed me, and ruined the entire party. I’m going to attempt to sum up what happened that night because I’ve been trying to forget about it. I pulled up to my friends birthday party (had her whole family at it btw) and my boyfriend is already there and visibly intoxicated, I asked him to bring me some vodka because I knew he had some. I don’t drink publicly because I hate being drunk around others, drunk people also overstimulate me a lot. Anyways, I asked him for the vodka, I grab the bottle and set it aside for when it’s just me and my friend. He chugs a Gatorade with vodka in it. I tell him to stop, I say I’m serious please don’t drink anymore. 5 mins later he grabs the bottle, and he takes a large sip. This made me visibly upset and I grab the bottle and put it back where it was supposed to be left alone till way later. What I did not know at the time and the thing that may have made me most upset, is the fact that when I left that room he chugged more vodka. Not too much later the whole party moved from her room (friends) to the living room with her family, my boyfriend still being visibly intoxicated. Her family is not okay with underage drinking mind you. He’s acting so poorly I tell the birthday girl what’s going on and that he needs to go sleep it off in her room (the most logical solution to me) and we take him to the room stumbling the whole way and effectively pissing me off. For the majority of the party I had to try and convince him to go to sleep  which didn’t work at all. He was loud and annoying and kept trying to get back up from the bed saying he was “sobered up now” he was not. He got up, his friend told him to lay down, “no”, his friend pushed him back onto the bed. The bed I was sitting on. Boyfriend ragdolls, arm flops out and closed fist strikes my nose and slightly breaks it. Ow. What the fuck?? I was pretending like I was fine and eventually I went outside to go cry on the curb next to my car alone. A few of my friends come comfort me, it’s cold out so we get in my car to chat and vent. The rest of that party was stressful and makes me upset so we’re going to move on now that you can understand how this relationship has been so far. You may be wondering, why stay? I don’t know. Up until a few days ago I still enjoyed his company and being his partner. But, a week ago my boyfriend was hanging out at his exs house, and he was taking selfies in the bathroom with 4 girls one of which being his ex girlfriend. He has done this before and I told him it made me uncomfortable. I wasn’t happy to see him doing it again , so naturally I communicated it as such. And… he left me on read? Weird.. suspicious even. I don’t put up with bad behavior so I posted on my instagram note “the concept of my bf being friends with his ex” this ofc got his attention and he reply’s with “not my ex”. He thinks that just bc they dated for a few months and thought they were better off as friends means that they “never dated”. But they dated for at least 6 months so they definitely dated, this was also sus to me and I was just really upset. I had texted him n I message and he ignored me until I posted something (he was actively on his phone ignoring me) I said I thought it was funny he couldn’t answer my text message but was able to reply to my instagram note. He took offense and reply’s with “geez what is with you” that obviously made me upset so I replied with “oh!” I was then left on read on everything and I was upset and crying. You may be wondering what I meant when I said I was cheating on my boyfriend in the title, enter lets call him J (m16) he replied to the instagram note and I explained the situation to him, and for the first time in a while i felt seen and heard by some one. After that conversation we kept texting throughout the week and eventually we hung out and i had a really good time, i as after this that i realized i had developed feelings for J and grew to despise my boyfriend even more. I have to wait until February to break up with my boyfriend but i would never physically cheat on my boyfriend. I am however having an emotional affair with J.

Then slowing down or feeling your feelings might become too big, so you just continue distracting and running away from it. It can also be a way to self-soothe if you have a lot of anxiety or other mental health distress. I think we just need to feel what we feel, sadness, anger, a mix of it or anything else, communicate, and then knowing we have done what we could, we start building relationships to meet our relational needs from healthy relationships outside of the house.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "My best friend was assaulted, I reported it and I'm riddled with so much guilt it's so hard to handle.", "text": "I apologize for the length  \n  \nUsing a throwaway because I don't want to be identified, I'm also gonna kind of simplify things so it can't come back to me. This is my first time posting on reddit so I'll try to make it easy to read and not a big block of text. I also don't know what tags to use, but odvious trigger warning because of the topic. I hope this is the right subreddit to post in.\n\nFor some background, I (16f) have been friends with \"Tia\" (15f) since middle school. We used to be extremely close since I was a new student, weird and thought she was the coolest person ever. Our whole friendship I've known her grandpa was a creep, because of offhand and nasty comments he would make compairing our bodies. He used to call my phone all the time and he found my facebook and added me. He never sent messages because I guess he doesn't know how to? Thats what Tia would say anyways.\n\nWhen we got to hs we kinda drifted, since I only had lunch and 4th block with her and she also started acting really really weird and it was kind of hard having a normal conversation with her. I didn't go to her house anymore since her grandma hated me and her grandpa is a nasty perv. This year I'm a sophmore and she flunked I think, so we don't have like any classes together anymore. She'd been acting even weirder, she kept texting me talking about how she knew I liked the dude she liked and how I should just admit it since they never dated anyways. I really don't he isn't my type. But since she'd been acting so weird and also I had a new friend group and kind of changed myself since ms we didn't really talk except for the occasional times she'd text asking to hang out.\n\nWednesday at midnight she sent me a video of her grandpa at her doorway saying disgusting things about how she couldn't handle him and how he banged her good (i changed the words a lot because he was really vulger and also i dont want ppl to realize im the poster). I freaked out, it was terrifying and I don't know why it really hit my heart bad. I told her she needed to go to the police and she was being confusing in her messages but said she wanted to run away and come over.\n\nI don't know why but i didn't do anything until yesterday. I went to the store after school and saw her and we hugged and talked briefly. She told me that she wasn't going to school because people were treating her like she was crazy, and I told her I would report it and she told me to please do. So the second I got home I reported it to this app we have on our school ipads, and they acted so fast. I sent the report and texted her, and like 5 minutes later she said cops were there and stopped answering. I downloaded the video in case something happened and she lost access probably because of her grandpa. I went downstairs and cried to my mom and dad, and they told me I did good and that I needed to talk to a counseler at school the next day.\n\n  \nThe people on the reporting app had reached out and sent a bunch of messages which I accidently ignored, and they didn't get back to me when I answered until like 4 hours later. I was shaking bad and I still havent stopped, so much has happened. I called a close friend and she stayed otp with me while I sobbed and messaged the reporter back and forth for a while. They asked for the video, and I airdropped it onto my school ipad but it wouldn't attatch so they asked what it said and I watched it again because I didn't really remember. I cried really hard watching again, and just thinking about it right now its making me want to cry again. I apparently wasn't supposed to watch it again but I did and they said that was all they needed and I cried the rest of the night.\n\nTia didn't answer her phone and still hasn't, so I was really upset while getting ready for school and kept crying my lashes off and having to glue them back on. I made it to like 2nd block today before they called me down and the counselor told me my mom had called and she said she wanted to speak to me. I told her what happened and cried again, I used like all her tissues and I told her how panicked I felt and so he went to our school officer and he told me that they had taken a statement and said they had the video and I ended up calling my mom to come home.\n\nLike half an hour ago the officer called my mom and dad and told them they needed the video from me, which I was confused about because they had said they had it but it was whatever and I emailed it. He said a CPS worker had taken her from the home and thats all he knew. But I'm still freaking out, and I feel like it's my fault. I've known her for almost three years and I knew he was a creep, and I feel like I could have reported it and prevented it from escelating. Everyone is telling me I'm brave and that I did the right thing, I know it was right but I don't feel brave at all. I have to talk to two specialists now and a social worker, and I feel like theres too much attention on me and not enough on her. I'm not the victim in this. I know theres probably a lot of attention on her too, but I wish they would just stop acting like I'm as traumatized as she is. I keep crying and crying. 2025 was already a shit year and my resolution this year was for it to be normal. We're only 9 days in and I've cried so much more than I did in the whole month of december. \n\n  \nI just needed to write it all out, again I'm sorry for the length.

I was trying to say that ICE agents aren't properly trained, and when a human is in a high stress situation, higher level cognition goes off-line and we revert to our baser instincts (ie. \"Gut reactions). You've probably at some point seen a child hit another child in reaction to a perceived threat (eg. child steals their toy). The child knows they shouldn't hit, but the stress of the situation overrides the child's prefrontal cortex and they lash out on instinct. It takes a lot of learning and practice to get to a point where the first reaction to stress or fear isn't a complete impulse. This happens to adults too in high stress situations. Police officers are supposed to be specifically trained to rationalize during high stress situations so this exact situation doesn't happen, but ICE agents are not properly trained. I completely agree with the sentiment that ICE agents are generally not good people and I especially don't think they should carry guns. However, we don't know what was going on in this person's mind when he did this and we will probably never know. He could've premeditated and thought this through, but it's equally as probable that he could've reacted impulsively in the moment due to lack of training. You're justified in your anger, but that anger should be directed towards the system as a whole.

I thought he had been at work, he was texting me as if he was, and i found out later that he’d been home for days.\n\nFor some reason this didn’t spark the drug red flag. ( i suspect this was when his relapse happened but i could be wrong )\n\nFast forward a few months, we live together, and i catch him doing cocaine alone in the living room at 4am.\n\nI forgave him. Said i understood but don’t approve. Let’s come up with a plan to quit. All the bs. All it did was enable him.\n\nIdk how much he uses now as i asked him to keep it private and i don’t want to see it or be around it, but i know it’s enough to put him in debt and he’s always broke.\n\nThere are constantly bloody soaked tissues in the trash and his nose is beginning to get scabs.\n\nHis mood swings have increased exponentially. Any tiny thing sets him off and i am constantly walking on eggshells around him. During an explosion, he degrades me and mocks my scared reaction to his behavior. Calls me stupid, idiot, dumba\\*\\*, bi\\*\\*\\*, etc. Tells me to shut the f\\*\\*\\* up.\n\nHe then disappears for hours or days, and when he comes back it’s a 50/50 on whether or not he’s in a better mood. If he is, there is no apology or discussion from him unless i ask for a conversation, which he gets mad about every time.\n\nThey’ve become pointless.\n\nWhen he is high, he gets into these very VERY specific moods. It’s like a totally new person takes over his body.\n\nHe is soft spoken, gentle, caring, going over the top for my needs. Communication is amazing, he acts like ‘ normal ‘\n\nBut once it’s worn off he is evil until he uses again, or he sleeps all day every day.\n\nHe doesn’t have a reaction when i tell him how heartbreaking this is for me. How i only feel safe around him when he’s high.\n\nOver the last 4 months my mental health has tanked. It’s like I’ve reverted ten years of growth and like im 15 again. Every drive home from work i get that same pit in my stomach that i would get when i knew id get in trouble after school. So i don’t know if im just really mentally in the shitter and making my problems seem worse than what they actually are.\n\nI’ve never done cocaine, only smoke weed. Maybe im totally wrong in everything im saying like he says i am but I try to talk about his using because i want to understand if this seemingly scheduled abuse is him, or the drugs.\n\n\\*\\*\\* while typing this i saw that he was looking at naked women on Reddit. He’s super secretive about his phone and i suspect he’s also a reddit goner given what i have seen. Jesus Christ what is my life at this point. \\*\\*\\*\n\nIdk i needed to word vomit while i had some time.

When I looked back up at her she was getting really close and then she just started kissing me. I didn't know what to do so I just froze and let her continue. She kept kissing me and kissing my neck and started fondling me. She used her fingers to (very quickly) bring me to climax and then I stood up-mentally told myself that I had finished so quickly simply because I wanted it to be over... my grandmother had just SA'd me.

The last year has been extremely heavy for me, he has been avoidant, kept lying to me about important stuff and was always giving me breadcrumbs. I have been in therapy for the past two years bc of BPD (even though I'm starting to suspect it may be cPTSD) and the last year I haven't feel seen by my therapist, she minimized a lot of our relationship issues, even when my friends started resenting him for how insensitive and dishonest he was being. On top of that I felt judged by her and had anxiety before and after every session, as if I wasn't going anymore to understand and manage myself better but only to check every week if I was being enough good enough, calm enough, rational enough, quiet enough to keep the peace. So I left her as well.\nI also left the cult my bf let me join with him when we were younger. I'm kinda worried about him still being in it, but after all he seems happy there. I can't decide what's best for him, I hope he takes care of himself. Now all I have is my friends, and even though it's all for the best, I've been crying and throwing up. I'll miss him for the rest of my life I think. I really loved him and despite his mistakes, I know he cared. I'll never live the same love again. He wanted to stay friends but I refused and he cried.

It was extremely cold.\nMy mother and I were standing outside with other people, praying out loud so that someone would hear us and open the door. After some time, the door finally opened. A fat male security guard stood there and let people in. We went down as well.\nI was about 10 years old.\nWe went down into a basement. At the entrance, they gave us one thin blanket. It was rough and itchy. You could either put it under yourself or cover yourself with it. The floor was freezing cold, but not covering yourself was also cold. We put our jackets under us and covered ourselves with the blanket.\nIt was a church basement.\nMy mother had refused apartments and houses because she liked living this way. I didn’t understand. At 10 years old, I kept thinking: What sins could I have committed to deserve this?\nWe slept there. There were people they called “possessed.” It sounds unreal, but they screamed all night and hit their heads against the floor. It was terrifying. After about six months, I got used to it. Every time I fell asleep, I was afraid of only one thing — that one day I would wake up and one of those people would be standing over me and do something to me.\nAt 4 a.m., we heard the sound of a small bell. That was how everyone was woken up. My eyes were so heavy it was scary. I could barely gather the blanket. We went toward the exit, returned the blanket, and went back outside.\nAgain, we waited for the church to open. It was cold. I was desperately sleepy.\n“Mom, I want to sleep,” I said.\nShe replied, “Pray for your sins.”\nI thought: What sins could I possibly have committed?\nThe church opened, and we were let in. I already knew every corner of that place. I went to a warmer spot. At first it was cold, but I fell asleep anyway.\nAfter some time, my mother woke me up. She was given a donation box. We went outside and stood at the entrance of the monastery. My mother told me to stand next to her because people gave more money when they saw a child.\nThe cold was unbearable.\nThe money was taken by the priests “for the church,” but I could see their expensive cars and two-story houses. Even as a child, I understood the difference. My mother didn’t.\nBy lunchtime, I was extremely hungry. We went to a free meal place. It was fasting time, so we were given only two pieces of bread and tea.\nAfter lunch, we could sit on a bench. That’s when my mother usually started crying. I asked her, “Mom, what’s wrong? Why are you crying again?”\nShe said, “I should have had an abortion. I would be living well now. Look at what my life has become.”\nI asked, “Aren’t you happy that I exist?”\nShe replied, “You don’t appreciate me. I’ll take pills right in front of you. What will you do then?”\nI said, “It’s not my fault.”\nShe started laughing.\nAt that moment, something broke inside me. I felt completely destroyed emotionally. One thought kept repeating in my head: She hates me.\nA few years earlier.\nMy mother and I went to an orphanage. She wanted to give me up. But she was told that if she left me there, the government would stop paying her benefits, because my father had died and this money was support from the state.\nShe changed her mind and didn’t leave me there.\nLooking back, all that money went to the church. She didn’t keep any money for us. I wore torn, dirty clothes of terrible quality. Many things were forbidden — jeans, chewing gum, phones.\nThere was only one thing allowed: praying.\nPraying and begging for forgiveness for sins.\nNote: This text was translated and edited with the help of ChatGPT because the author is not a native English speaker.

Waking up each day knowing I was slowly moving closer to what lay ahead broke something inside me quietly. I wasn’t ready for this. Not yet.\n\nFourteen months ago, in the middle of this crisis, I met my girlfriend, and we began a relationship. I found emotional refuge in her. She became my anchor during my worst moments; every scan, every progression, every update. I would break down for hours, and she would stay by my side without wavering. I shared my deepest fears about losing my mother, and she would patiently and calmly talk me through them.\n\nOur relationship was never ordinary. Despite demanding professional lives, we cared for each other in ways neither of us had experienced before. We often spoke about how love had never felt this warm or reassuring. Even while dealing with my own anticipatory grief, I made sure she had space to express her feelings and fears. She is differently abled, and we spoke at length about her anxieties, her paranoia, and how to make life more accessible and easier for her. For the last six months, we were in a long-distance relationship due to work, but we made sure to meet whenever possible.\n\nThings were holding together, until one day, everything fell apart.\n\nMy mother’s condition worsened, and she was put on daily radiation therapy. Driving her to the hospital each day was emotionally devastating. Watching the treatment drain her, while forcing myself to stay composed for her sake, pushed me past limits I didn’t know I had. Crying didn’t change reality, but neither did pretending I was okay.\n\nDuring this time, my mother and I were living in a rented apartment. In the middle of her radiation therapy, our landlord wrongfully evicted us. I could either fight him legally or find us a new place immediately. I didn’t have the strength left in me for another battle. While managing her treatment, I vacated our home and moved us overnight.\n\nAs if this wasn’t enough, I was assigned an extremely gruelling role at work with intense pressure and hours.\n\nFor three weeks, I survived on less than two hours of sleep a day. I lost consciousness twice from sheer exhaustion. I was constantly drained, struggling to stay present, or even track what time of the day it was. I pushed through each day carrying immense physical and emotional pain, just to keep things afloat.\n\nAnd then the final blow landed.\n\nMy girlfriend called me and ended the relationship over the phone. In that moment, everything stopped making sense. I felt completely hollowed out.\n\nDuring those same three weeks while my life was unraveling, she was on her first international trip. We had spoken about it extensively before she left. She was extremely excited and I was genuinely happy for her. Despite everything that I was dealing with, I checked in on her every day. I sensed a growing distance in her replies but conceded to her attributing it to travel fatigue. I simply didn’t have the emotional capacity in me to question it further.\n\nShe called me two days after returning and said it wasn’t working anymore. She said my mother’s ongoing illness made it difficult for her to share her happiness with me. She felt guilty if she shared it and suffocated if she didn’t. She said she was tired, that this wasn’t how she wanted to live, and that she wanted to break up.\n\nUp to this point, I understood her perspective. I respected it and let her walk away peacefully. I was emotionally numb and too exhausted to react.\n\nUntil she texted me later that night.\n\nShe sent long paragraphs describing me in extremely degrading terms, listing what she called my behavioural flaws under the label of “constructive feedback.” I begged her to stop, explaining that it was pushing me towards a breakdown in the middle of the night, but she didn’t stop.\n\nAfter systematically tearing apart my character, she moved on to criticizing my body and weight, despite knowing in detail about my stress-induced eating disorder. She described my appearance as deeply agonising and causing irreversible emotional distance.\n\nThat was the point where I realised I needed to protect myself. And I blocked her.\n\n⸻\n\nFour days later, once I had calmed down enough to function, I unblocked her. She didn’t really apologise for what had happened, but we spoke on and off for about two weeks. During this time, I even helped her with a job switch application. I was doing all of this in the hopes of a reconciliation, because I genuinely loved her and needed her in my life. At that point, she felt like the only emotional support I had left.\n\nWhen I eventually tried to talk about boundaries, something as basic as asking for clarity around calls, she told me that engaging with me was making her so anxious that she felt physically sick, and that I needed to give her time and distance. Even though it was clear by then that she had moved further away from me than ever, I respected what she asked for and stepped back.\n\nI went completely no contact for four weeks.\n\nIt wasn’t easy. The reality of everything I was dealing with finally caught up to me. I broke down every single day. I cried myself to sleep, inconsolably and struggling to even breathe properly. My appetite disappeared, my body associated food with shame and abandonment. I would forget to eat for entire days, and when I did, it felt mechanical. My chest felt constantly stiff, and my body stayed in a near-permanent state of panic all day.\n\nWhen I felt I had given her enough time and space, I reached out again, casually. We spoke about trivial life updates until I eventually broke down and told her how difficult things had become for me, how overwhelmed I felt, and how badly I needed her. I told her I was willing to work on myself and on everything that had gone wrong. In that moment, I let go of my self-worth and self-respect, because the pain of losing the only person who had felt like an anchor was unbearable. None of it was acknowledged. My calls went unanswered. My messages and voice notes were ignored.\n\nOut of desperation and as last resort, I reached out to a few of her friends, hoping they could help mediate or at least get her to speak to me. I was polite, sincerely apologetic, and clear that I didn’t want to cause them any trouble. None of them responded. That was when she finally replied, angrily, accusing me of harassment and responding to me with extreme hostility.\n\nWhat followed is something I still struggle to process.\n\nShe mocked my mother’s illness. She told me to “man up” and stop behaving like a baby about my situation. She said that if she could end a past relationship with someone grieving his parent’s death and be unapologetic about it, then my ongoing situation with my mother would never make a dent in her mind. I tried to explain myself. I asked for empathy. The conversation kept escalating until I was completely depleted and emotionally shut down.\n\nEventually, I stopped responding, not because I found closure, but because I had nothing left to offer.\n\nSince then, I’ve been deeply unsettled. There is a constant physical discomfort in my body that doesn’t seem to ease. My anxiety shows up in my breathing, in my sleep crashes, in my inability to focus at work, and in how hard it feels to get through basic daily tasks. I later realised that even while we were together, she had already begun emotionally gravitating elsewhere. I also found out that my breakup and emotional collapse became a subject of mockery among her close friends.\n\nI’m struggling to reconcile how someone who once held me together during the worst period of my life could eventually treat my pain with such cruelty and nonchalance. I’m not writing this to vilify her or to seek validation; I’m writing because I’m trying to make sense of how love can transform into something so unrecognisable. And how I’m supposed to carry all of this while continuing to show up for my mother and for life.\n\n⸻\n\nI’m not looking for judgements, diagnoses, or advice. Writing this is simply a part of me trying to process everything I’ve been carrying alone for months. If you’ve read this far, thank you for holding space for me. I might not be able to engage further, but I might sleep slightly well tonight knowing I could put this somewhere outside my own head.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767993151.0, "id": "1q8khj2", "author": "Key-Effective-3088", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8khj2/processing_grief_heartbreak_and_exhaustion_all_at/"}

Its oft talked about. I wont elaborate. And it doesnt take me by surprise but it does gnaw at me, ever so slowly, every day\n\nThe way this struggle takes shape in my personal relationship is something that is scouring out my soul and spirit. I hold friendships as closely as romantic relationships. I am a devout friend. I recently saved a friend from an abusive home and let her make her home in mine while i single handedly paid the bills. I used to do household chores but the fatigue is strong right now since I am doing interviews while completing my notice period. I am in debt but i expect that to be entirely my responsibility to pay up. I used to call my friend my wife sincerely since i trust her with everything and she would say the same.\n\nShe recently got a boyfriend and everything changed within days. She started telling him my sensitive secrets and now doesnt talk to me about anything real and has started wanting me to do more household chores right and is not as impressed if i do anything for her. She gushes about her boyfriend's gifts when i have given her so many and it never elicited that reaction. I just thought she never gives big reactions.\n\nHeck, i gave her a new life while i was unemployed because i didnt want her to be with people who didnt value her and were hurting her.\n\nJust like at work, my value is being eroded and a man gets the credit. I just didnt make the cut.\n\nI saved her life. I gave her a safe home while working extremely hard everyday. It doesnt seem enough. I gave up all of my personal space to have her be safe. I feel incredibly dehumanised. \n\nIts the way society works. Romantic relationships are above everything else. Especially, female friendships. I feel so stupid.

There were two older employees on the team, probably 10–15 years older than me, in their early to mid-40s. During my year in that group, one of them left the bank, and the other was restructured.\n\nOver the years, I kept an eye on their LinkedIn profiles, and neither of them landed on their feet. The one who left went to another bank but hasn’t had a legitimate job since 2017. The other went back to school, got a master’s degree, and didn’t find work until seven years later. Seven.\n\nAt the time, I was young and thought, *that’ll never be me*. Still, I kept doing the bare minimum.\n\nIn 2016, I got a role I actually enjoyed and worked hard at. I genuinely thought it would set me up for life. I had a career. But my core problem never really changed: **I have a shitty attitude.** I also only do the elements of a job that I really want. Financial analysis? Hell yea! Voluntary presentations? Hell no. Talking to clients? Hell no!\n\nIronically, that role had great exit opportunities—*if* you worked toward them. \n\nI didn’t.\n\nThen COVID hit. A new boss came in. My routine collapsed, I got depressed, and my effort level fell off a cliff. \n\nDid I do anything to fix it? \n\nOf course not.\n\nDespite that, my old boss liked me and brought me along to a department he was now running. I was making even more money. He didn't know that I was depressed.\n\nOld boss moved on in 2022 and I got restructured in October 2023. The severance was solid, and I spent the next three months doing absolutely nothing. After that, the first person I reached out to gave me a job in a new industry. And, predictably, I still had an attitude—and the job wasn’t perfect.\n\nLong story, but, I’ve been unemployed since June 2025. \n\nI can’t believe this happened to me, but looking back, it actually makes complete sense. I was oblivious to the only logical outcome.\n\nI’m still applying for jobs. I have enough cash to last another 6–12 months. After that, I’d have to start dipping into long-term savings, which I really want to avoid.\n\nRight now, it feels like I’m done for. My experience is scattered, there’s no obvious path back, and I never got any industry certifications (CPA, CFA, etc.) because I thought I didn’t need them.\n\nI’m incredibly disappointed in myself. I really could have had it all. Instead, I might end up moving back in with my parents, who are nearing 80, in a city three provinces away.\n\nI’ve got five years to figure my shit out.

but he proved me so wrong. we were making out and getting close to the point, and he got over top of me and pulled my legs apart but then he just? looked at me? and stopped, and just held me. and that's when i knew he was different and i never wanted to lose him. i still don't know the exact reason he stopped. but i really do think it's because he saw me, and understood why i was doing what i was doing and refused to take advantage of me. i thought i was going to marry this man. i always believed i didn't want kids but when i met him, slowly, that changed and i found myself thinking a lot about a future being married to him with his kids. i loved this man so much, i literally got broken heart syndrome when we broke things off lmao. good times :/ i wrote in my diary journal thingy that i was never going to date again. he'd be my last love. everything he showed me was perfect, he was perfect, and supposedly it ended because he wasn't ready which is completely fair. i was fine with leaving my life's romance story at that. plus i was too scared to try and find someone new. i didn't think i'd ever find a man like him again and so far i still haven't. then this is where i did the digging, and found out he already had someone new. when i eventually asked if there had been someone else while we were together, he left me on read. silence in these situations tells you everything you need to know, so i got all heartbroken again but this time, i completely ignored my little vow to not date. i felt so worthless. i wanted to marry this man, he told me i made him so happy, that he would do anything for me. he would talk to me so gently and lovingly and caringly, he was so perfect. and the whole time, there was another person? \n\nthis next part is completely my fault. i should've stayed alone. but i eventually found another guy and we started dating. i don't like this, but we had sex a lot. i've identified as asexual since high school but started just. keeping it a secret because idk if a man could really love me if i don't have sex with him. anyways. this is going to be hard to say to strangers on the internet but you guys can judge me as you will. i ended up accusing this man of rape because of a few instances that did not feel right to me at all. my friends at the time told me that it was sa, but i don't know. i really don't know and i feel so guilty because i might've spoke too soon about what the situation really was but i don't know. there were 2 or 3 nights where we'd had some drinks and gotten pretty drunk. and i got on top of him to kiss him, just for the sake of kissing him. we'd get pretty into it and i would sometimes grind on him too, and he would eventually flip me over onto my back. the thing is i tried to push him off of me when he did this. i don't know if i wasn't pushing hard enough or if he was ignoring me. then he'd be on top of me still kissing and would go at my neck, i would just freeze up because i was really scared. when he got off i'd take my clothes off and he would do what he wanted. these nights, he never asked me once if i was ok with what was happening. back then, it felt like he was just ignoring that i was pushing him off and that i didn't have a choice. now that i'm older, i've tried to see things from his perspective and realised that the grinding on him probably seemed like i was trying to initiate something, and taking my clothes off just looked like consent to him. and i didn't tell him to stop. that's because i was genuinely so scared but he might not have been able to tell. every other time aside from those nights, he would ask for consent or say something that gave me a chance to speak up so idk why not those nights. we eventually broke up because the relationship was also pretty toxic.\n\ni started dating another guy shortly after, bad decision i know, but idk i thought it would be fine since we were coworkers, we sorta knew each other. we got to know each other a bit before it was official through group outings started by another coworker. i slept over at his house a lot and we would watch shows together and drink and it was fun times. but then he molested me. one night while i was falling asleep next to him he stuck his hands down my pants and he went underneath my underwear to feel my vagina. i just stayed pretending to be asleep, and he eventually stopped. another night, again when i was falling asleep he lifted my shirt and touched my boobs for a bit then started licking and sucking them while i was literally laying there with my eyes closed not reciprocating anything he was doing to me, just hoping he would stop and not do anything worse to me. i know i should've left the first night he did that to me but i was unsure and i still am unsure if it was really wrong of him to do to me. i think it was, because i was laying there with my eyes closed for a long time before he did what he did to me and although i wasn't fully asleep, it couldn't have looked like i was awake. how could he have thought it was an appropriate time? but like, i wasn't fully asleep just dozing off and i didn't tell him to stop out of fear again, but that doesn't mean i wanted it to happen either. after i left him i stupidly went back to my ex, the one from the last paragraph. i wasn't planning on trying to date him again, i just needed some comfort after what happened. i told him what happened, and when i spent the night at his place and fell asleep in his bed, i woke up to him with his hand down my pants touching me the way my ex did. i pulled away sharply this time, i wasn't gonna let it happen again. luckily he stopped and didn't do anything else the rest of the night.\n\ni stayed single for a while after that, but i did get back in contact with my love i described in the start of this vent. he was still with the girl he cheated on me for so i did feel really bad, i wasn't trying to get in the way of their relationship or homewreck, i just needed to talk to the only one who had ever made me feel safe. he welcomed me back with open arms and we started talking again. we sent tiktoks back and forth and really bonded over sleep token music lol. i asked him what really happened with the other girl when we were together and he finally told me. she was a \"mutual friend of a friend\" and they started talking, and she \"became his best friend.\" that last part really hurt to hear considering while we were together shouldn't that have been my place? why did he let her get in the way so easily? we had a deep talk about what we used to be. turns out he only wanted to rush into a relationship with me because he was lonely. we stayed friends for a little bit after that but i blocked him randomly one day because i just couldn't stop overthinking, i had so many things i wanted to say to him but i couldn't. he's happy in his poly relationship with his girlfriend and i don't want to ruin that. but i was just holding in so much i felt i would go insane if i didn't talk to him and get things off my chest so i blocked him. and it didn't make the feelings go away. that's why i'm here now i guess. it's been a few months since i blocked him and i recently unblocked and sent him a message trying to become friends again. i still won't tell him anything that's happened or how i feel but i do miss sending tiktoks and talking and we did meet up again, (his gf gave him permission i guess that's just something polyamorous people are cool with?) and i want to see him again but i don't think he'll be letting me back anytime soon.\n\num. so that all was supposed to just be a brief history, but damn ok. what's bothering me now, what i really want to but can't talk to anyone about is the effect these assaults have taken on me. if it's even fair to call it assault. i really don't know. anyways. i haven't seen many people talk about the empty feeling being assaulted leaves you with. it's so lonely. i don't think anyone could ever love someone who's been assaulted. there's nothing left of me to love. i remember when i was a teenager in high school and the worst that ever happened to me was a bf pressured me to makeout with him. i thought i wouldn't recover from it back then, yet i still loved to spend time with my friends, i loved my anime and tv shows, i played my video games, wrote my stories and had a good time. now, what these men did to me and the horrible things they said to me after has shattered me completely. i still watch shows, but i just don't care about them anymore. i can't get into things i loved before. when i go out with my bestie i just want to go home. but when i'm at home i want to get out of the house, and when i'm out of the house i just feel so. lost. something in me is missing now, i don't feel right anywhere i am and i don't feel right in my own skin. whatever was taken from me isn't coming back. how can i love someone as a husk of myself? if all that's ever on my mind is what happened to me and how i wish i could go back to the first man who made me feel safe? it's been 2½ years, i don't know if i'll ever get over my ex. i just want so badly to be safe with him again. i got into another relationship very recently but we called it off after a month because i was so distant. i tried to focus on him but i honestly can't focus on him or anyone around me when i can't stop thinking about what's happened, and my ex. it's so unfair to everyone. am i even allowed to be this broken over what happened? was it really sexual assault if i didn't tell them to stop? other people have had it much, much worse than me. so i should get over it. idk.\n\ni feel a lot better now that i've written this all down. if anyone responds, please be nice. i know it's probably not fair to have accused that one guy of sexual assault and i do regret it deeply, i don't need to be bashed anymore than he already has. a simple \"you were wrong about it\" or something will do. if you even read this far, thanks for listening i know that was a lot.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767991197.0, "id": "1q8jmfr", "author": "stuckin23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8jmfr/these_past_2_years_have_been_so_hard/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I'm tired of this world.", "text": "I don't know where to start so I will just start rambling. English is my third language so forgive any language related transgressions.\n\nI'm tired of people, I'm tired of everything going on in this world.\n\nI live in a first world country in Europe, having been adopted from South East Asia when I was 3 months old. As far as I remember, childhood was bliss. Loving (helicopter) parents, good friends... When I was 4 I was diagnosed with giftedness (performance IQ 115, verbal IQ 140), and my parents did whatever they could to help, or so they thought. They made me skip a grade, which made me the runt of the class (being born in december) but I don't blame them for anything, they did the best they could. \n\n  \nHigh school was hell, I did not fit in due to being a hardcore introvert and the bullying did not help. Did not have many friends, much less real friends, maybe one. As the cliché goes I stopped performing well at school to be a bit more edgy or whatever it would take so not everybody would see me as an outcast. At 15 y.o I had my first girlfriend, which only happened because the girl had a crush on me because I was Asian I suppose. I won't bother with the details because that was 17 years ago so my memory doesn't serve me well, but the gist of it was I said yes to being her boyfriend because I didn't want to be alone. I do not understand the concept of love, I never did, only the need not to be alone. So I endured some verbal abuse and emotional suffering (she wanted to harm herself for various reasons etc).\n\nFast forward 2 years, I met another girl while still in a relationship with the previous and being the juvenile asshole that I was I started a relationship with her too, while letting the first one fade out, she was very sweet but once again I only felt affection, not really love. One year later I did the same when I met another girl who for some reason really liked me. Same story, we were together for 2 years even. She ended the relationship when abroad on vacation but I didn't really feel sad, I had already 'moved on' and set my sights on somebody else. \n\nShe was not pretty by conventional standards, but for some reason I was madly attracted to her so for the first time ever I actually chased someone. Perserverance payed off, or so I thought. 6 months later she broke up with me (20 y.o at the time) and for the first time I felt this enormous non-physical pain like a gaping hole. I was confused. Did i experience heartbreak or was I just raging for losing control. At that time I was also studying in college for Public Administration but I left disillusioned because no matter how I tried to make it work, government was never an anwser. I did however thourougly enjoy talking about politics and the necessity of public servants. During my studies I worked as a waiter at events to help me overcome me being socially incapable, while also enjoying the work. \n\n  \nAt 22 I met my 'biggest relationship' which spanned 8 years. We were doomed from the start. I became her favorite person (in terms of bipolarity) and me being me just went along for the ride. I wasn't happy, but at least I had something going I think...\n\nWe quickly became codependent on each other, which was further enforced by the COVID lockdowns. I was still figuring out what I wanted from life, but it was easier to let her decide the stuff that mattered. She had her flaws, linked to her bipolarity but I was considering the (dis)advantages of staying together. Since the lockdowns made everyones lives grind to a halt we were stuck in limbo at 25-26y.o and when those lockdowns ended she wanted to make up for lost time (child and marriage asap). We moved from my appartment to a row house in the suburbs she bought but the house needed many renovations. From the start when we had fights she would become this emotional supernova while I tried to disengage and retreat while at that time she wouldnt let me physically leave. It started with me - being non confrontational- just letting her scream, evolving to pushing her away (hard) and spilling coffee on the wooden floor (because it was her house), thinking if I can't leave I might as well do some damage. \n\nAfter 1 grueling year of working (still in hospitality) and renovating we had talks about having a kid, I bought some time with good arguments but I knew I couldn't keep postponing. After 2 months she was already pregnant and 9 months later we had a beautiful son. This time I was very sure I did not love her. I can feel anger, sadness, empathy and joy, etc... But I never (except maybe for the short relationship with that one girl I chased) felt love, or how people say it's supposed to feel. I just felt as time went by I had to hide more of myself. She also didn't approve of my best friend (he was a bad influence according to her, I didn't disagree but I needed an escape from time to time) so we made the deal I would see him once a month. \n\nTrying to make things better we went to a trip to Rome. -sidenote; we promised each other to always be available by phone if needed- on the second day we visited the Colosseum while I was handling the stroller (which had her phone in it too). I had to go up with the elevator and join the group but as we reached the end we had to go downstairs (no elevator, unless I went back). For some reason she followed the group while I was struggling with the stroller, I tried to race back to the elevator but I had lost everyone and I couldn't reach her. There I stood alone with my infant son and girlfriend nowhere to be seen. After one hour of searching I finally found her (we had an earpiece from the guide and I was moving towards the sound) but I was pissed beyond reason and told her I wanted to go back to the hotel. She convinced me to stay on the tour and when that was done we went to a shitty restaurant and a wine bar after. I drank heavilly. At 135lbs I drank +2 bottles of red wine because I tried to cope with the fact I was left alone in a city I didn't know. When I helped my son walk barefoot on the streets (still learning how to walk then) she berated my for doing so. \n\nI lost it. I struck her in the face and ran away. I walked back to the hotel and \"reconciled\" meeting her there but something had broken. When we got back from our travels I tried to be better, I even bought an engagement ring and proposed. We (she) planned for a small wedding, and I thought that would be the end of our troubles. I met up with my best friend later and drank a lot, again. When I came home I got berated for the state I was in, I lost it again. I worked 4 days a week from 10AM till 00AM with little or zero breaks to make ends meet for us and she knew I needed an escape now and then. My 5th 'work day' was taking care of our son and she insisted I also woke up with her at 7AM on the weekends. \n\nI took a bottle of some scotch and drank it up. She went on going crazy. I hit her again. I couldn't keep the noise out. We broke up and quickly made an arrangement for custody. \n\nI felt guilty for my actions, she knew I felt sorry and it became obvious she started using my guilt for her own personal gain. Spent a shitload of money on psychologists but it didn't help, or at least that's my experience. The few friends I had left that knew us both weren't surprised what happened. \n\nI was alone for the first time since I was 15. Happier, but alone. We made an arrangement with rules for custody and child support and whenever I didn't have my son I went working so I could buy my own house (moved back with my mom for 6 months).\n\nFrom the start I have been met by malicious compliance by her and other stuff like berating me when I was 2-5 minutes late while she herself was regulary late for +15mins or so. I let it slide out of guilt. But it kept happening. She also didn't want to say anything much about our son so I had to figure it out by myself while he couldn't really talk/ communicate. \n\nShe doesn't uphold our agreement and I expressed my dissatisfaction in a polite manner, but it doens't matter. She keeps ignoring being on time or communicating and I am, as a result, comtemplating to hurt her back. \n\nMy mind feels clouded. I want to hurt her so bad but I don't want my son to lose his mother. I don't have much family left as opposed to her, and my intrusive thoughts are getting the better hand of me the last weeks. I want to hurt her family (who never approved of me anyways so I'm not holding thought back there), even going as far as giving up my life and just go around and kill them all. \n\nI have no real justification for this, and I'm aware of that. But I feel like I'm losing grip, and just like the day we broke up and I was drunk out of my mind thinking 'fuck you I'm tired of this shit', now I'm having the same thoughts sober.\n\nI have been faking love all my life, and at this point I feel to broken to even begin healing. My mind is blurred and the only options I see is by sharing and multiplying the suffering by going on a killing spree or just ending it for myself.\n\nI'm sorry for this incoherent crazy post, throwaway for obvious reasons and I also won't come back to check on it. Just wanted to share how I feel for once in my lifetime.

Around 4 or so months ago, both of my dad’s retinas detached. Since then, I’ve been my dad’s primary care taker, taking him to doctors appointments, several extremely traumatic surgeries, grocery shopping, cleaning the house, etc.\n\nIn the past month, I had to start working part time because my dad was having doctors appointments every other day. Oftentimes, we’d be there anywhere from 3-6 hours.\n\nAs you can imagine, this has been extremely hard on me and my dad. Because my friends and my bf live an hour away, I’ve spent a lot of time either at work, the doctors, or isolation. I definitely am in a situation where I need emotional support.\n\nFor a while I’d call my boyfriend every other day or so, and we’d talk from anywhere from 5min-30min. However, around a month ago, during the stress of the holiday season and my dads health being the worst it’s ever been, he told me point blank that he does not enjoy talking on the phone with me and would rather talk in person.\n\nThis really hurt me. It also hurt me that he had never called me to ask me about my dad, or plans dates half way between us. I always have to bring up my dad and then feel like a burden when I do, because it is, of course, a major bummer.\n\nWhen I do talk about what’s going, all he does is say “that sucks.” I really wish he was open to having deeper, more exploratory conversations because this is most definitely a life changing experience for both me and my father.\n\nI brought up the phone call thing, and he did apologize for it. However, he keeps acting avoidant. He doesn’t plan dates, or to meet me somewhere in the middle, and he still never asks about my dad.\n\nRecently, I had time to meet some friends at a bar for trivia after work. Because my boyfriend is unemployed and not taking any classes rn, I thought he could meet me there 1.5-2 hours early so we can talk before our friends get there.\n\nIn my head, this was like a little date, because we haven’t seen each other in a while. Unfortunately, he negotiated to get there an hour before our friends got there, so I had to wait.\n\nWhen he got there, he seemed fairly depressed, quiet, disinterested, and stoned. I was obviously upset by this, but tried to keep the tone light and airy for when our friends came. Afterwards, I pulled him aside and asked if he was feeling ok.\n\nLong story short, I told him that I felt hurt that his body language looked so depressed because I hadn’t seen him in a while. He got very defensive, said that I talk to much, that I’m paranoid, that I never let him speak, and that it’s not that big of a deal if he comes to meet me sleepy and stoned.\n\nI do talk a lot, but part of it is because he talks so little. If I don’t ask him a question, he usually won’t say much at all, if anything. So sometimes I do feel a little ADHD around him, bc I’m trying to find something that “sticks.”\n\nIn conclusion, I really want him to open up more so we can feel closer. We have a good baseline level of attraction and warmth with each other that I really really want to advance and cultivate. But everytime I try to bring up a deep, or difficult conversation or an inconvenient emotion (like talking about my dad) he just completely shuts off. He doesn’t want to explore it, he gets defensive, and he’s sooo private.\n\nI’m frustrated bc I’m at my ropes end trying to take care of my dad, and I just wish my boyfriend would realize that by being insensitive, he’s really making me feel way worse than I’d like to rn.\n\nAt the very least, I just wish that he’d genuinely acknowledge, in a deep and meaningful way, that I am doing so fucking much rn, and all I want is for my bf to act like he enjoys talking to me.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for how I can try to explain this to him in a way where he won’t get super defensive?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768010821.0, "id": "1q8rkan", "author": "azaleaflow", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8rkan/im_f26_frustrated_with_my_boyfriends_m27_avoidant/"}

Its not ideal to say okay after this time dont speak of your worries but i think sometimes when it just feels like a relationship is heavy guys can tend to want to take a step back because even though you dont excpect him to fix your issues as a boyfriend i imsgine as a girlfriend to it feels shitty to not be able to comfort a partner.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Was I a rebound? I can’t stop thinking about his ex", "text": "Mid 2025 I met this guy at work and we hit it off. I felt this connection and pull to him I almost never feel with anyone, and interest and curiosity to find out more about him drew me in. He was quiet and reserved and I could tell he wanted to talk to me too.\n\nWe slowly started talking and speaking to him was the highlight of my day. Not to seem too eager (especially because I’m shy), I made sure to limit our interactions so I didn’t come across too excited. As the weeks flew by our connection grew stronger. We would go out after work together at least once a week for hours, sometimes until early morning. He introduced me to one of his close friends and we would go out on late night adventures, or the movies, or some sort of fun activity.\n\nEventually I confessed to liking him and he told me he felt the same. From then the hangouts were just us two without extra company and they became dates. After a few more weeks we made it official.\n\nBeing with him felt like a drug. There was never a dull moment. Even when we weren’t doing anything or just walking side by side I was so content. Although he wasn’t the type (physically or personality wise) I had imagined for myself in the past, I found that I liked him and accepted him as a whole.\n\nI loved him with my whole being and since it was my first relationship I wanted to give it my all and treat him the best I could. I remember one of the first times we kissed it was freezing and raining and we were waiting for our dinner booking, so we stood under shelter and hugged to keep warm. I pulled back and kissed him and I looked him in the eyes and said, “Promise me you’ll never hurt me. Please stay kind to me.” He looked shocked/uncomfortable but said “of course.” I meant it so genuinely. He was my first everything.\n\nBut when it became official something shifted. It felt like he approached me with lust. The emotional connection was not being built and it felt like it was only escalating physically. I told him we needed to slow down and that I was still curious about him and wanted to know him and feel connected to him more. It felt like there was a wall between us and there was only so close I could get to him.\n\nI was wary of overwhelming him so I never pressed or asked him too much when he would tell me he was going through things. I assumed if he truly wanted to tell me, he eventually would.\n\nHe slowly distanced himself and I constantly questioned and wondered what I was doing wrong. I wanted to fix any problems we had because I had so much hope and desire for our relationship to flourish. I voiced that I felt this wall between us and he took it as “I’m not enough” or “I’m not good.” He felt uncomfortable and needed space.\n\nWe took a break from the relationship to work through our 'issues' and decided to try again in a month.\n\nDuring that month it seemed like he was itching to constantly talk to me and I had to remind him that this was time to focus on ourselves. The month passed and on the day we were meant to be together again, he switched again and was even more distant. Then a week later he dumped me over text. No reason. He didn’t want to talk it out.\n\n(And later I found out through someone else that he’d apparently said he 'doesn’t want to date someone in the workplace' and that he 'doesn’t want to see me every day.' when they asked what happened between me and him (bc we used to always get lunch and take our breaks together) Which hurt so badly because it landed like I wasn’t special enough.)\n\nThe worst part is we work together, and nobody at work knows we even dated. I’ve kept my dignity and I never spoke or interacted with him when I see him at work after he dumped me. No words have been exchanged and it’s been over 100 days.\n\nThere hasn’t been a day that I have not thought about him. I think about him when I wake up and when I fall asleep. I miss him so much and it hurts me so much that he just threw everything away like I did not matter. He meant so much to me. I felt comfortable and at home when I was with him.\n\nA couple months after we 'broke up' I found out (through rumours from another colleague) that he had a girlfriend from when we first met. Apparently a few weeks into meeting me he broke up with her, then started talking to me fully. From what I see online it looks like they dated over a year.\n\nAnd apparently through the course of us dating, she was contacting him through any means possible: multiple social media accounts, email, and even bank transfers.\n\nBut because nobody at work knows we even dated, I’ve had to remain completely unphased with this information. Like I just have to act normal every day at work as if this wasn’t my entire life.\n\nNow I feel even worse because I don’t know if I could have been a contributing factor to their breakup. And she is - like 7 months after he broke up with her - still reposting about how hurt she is, how her ex cheated on her, and how she still loves him.\n\nMoreover, when he was with me, I can see and have noticed all the ways he would compare me to her. He seemed like he was using me to replace her. He would bring me to all the places they ate at. I’m not even sure what I was. Was I a rebound? Maybe I wasn’t 'better' and he regretted leaving his ex so he dumped me like I was nothing?\n\nMy self-worth is horrible right now. There are times where I’m like maybe I was super boring. I’m not as beautiful or thin or photogenic or interesting as her. Why did he even choose me?\n\nOnline there are sayings that guys always go for someone more convenient. So is that it? I was just easy? I feel like I’m living in the dark. I’m in so much mental pain from this and the worst thing is I feel like I have no right to even get answers as I was just some side chick. Was what we had even a relationship? It wasn’t even a month that we were official. It wasn’t some full blown year relationship, so what gives me the right to be upset or seek answers?\n\nI’m starting to move on from him but his ex just won’t leave my mind. I stalk her social media every day and just pick myself apart when I see her. She’s so beautiful. I just don’t understand when he even spoke to me or liked me. I don’t even know if he actually liked me. This cognitive dissonance is so painful.\n\nI can’t tell anyone about this. Nobody at work knows we even dated. Sometimes it just feels like something that lives in my mind - like a dream or hallucination -and because he hasn’t reached out and we never talked it out, I feel so stupid that it’s still affecting me so much. I feel like I’m just imagining it all and I’m being unreasonable.\n\nHe was my first everything and I feel so naive and stupid. Was I used? It felt so real.\n\nDid he break up with me because he was scared I was going to find out that he didn’t do a clean breakup with his ex? I remember at the start of when we were first talking I told him I wouldn’t have even spoken to him if he wasn’t single and he reassured me he was. Like I had this urk in me that always felt like there was something not adding up -a timeline mismatch or 'the wall' between us. And now I’m thinking the wall was the information he was keeping from me.\n\nAt this point I just wish he would message me a sorry. Just to confirm that it was all real. That I’m not crazy to be so, so hurt. So I can move on.\n\ntldr  \nI met a guy at work in mid-2025 and we slowly built a really intense connection that felt like my first real relationship. Once we made it official, he became distant and it felt like it turned mostly physical with a 'wall' between us. We took a one-month break, then on the day we were meant to try again he switched and a week later dumped me over text with no explanation and refused to talk. Months later I found out he had a long-term girlfriend when we first met and she was still chasing him during/after our time together, so now I’m spiralling wondering if I was a other woman comparing myself to her, and questioning if any of it was real. We still work together and nobody knows we dated, so I’ve had to act normal while thinking about him every day and craving even a simple apology for closure.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768008988.0, "id": "1q8qvt9", "author": "scaramoofan611", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8qvt9/was_i_a_rebound_i_cant_stop_thinking_about_his_ex/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I finally stopped feeling guilty for breaking up my relationship of seven years", "text": "I f24 broke up with my ex-boyfriend m25 shortly before our seven year anniversary because I fell in love with my a man I befriended 3 weeks before the breakup. I hated myself for that, because this exact scenario reversed was always my biggest nightmare. \n\nI had idealized our relationship for so long and didn't realize what a shitty bf he actually was until a man who was little more than a stranger at that point showed me more appreciation in three weeks than he did in almost seven years. My ex was and probably still is one of the best ppl I ever met: funny, extremely smart, clean, ambitious, etc. - but I still fell out of love and broke his heart. We are both very avoidant, non-confrontational people, which ultimately meant I rarely voiced my problems or shared my emotions. When I did, he managed to convince me I was in the wrong almost every time. \n\nNow to the part that I need to get off my chest. All of these things that led to our breakup, that I need to remind me of whenever I start to feel guilty again. I never regretted the breakup. But hurting him in that way still weighs on my conscience. \n\n1. **Driving** \\- most of the times he straight up refused to drive, even though he has a license and I have a car. At one point I drove us to our hometown, a two hour drive on one of the hottest days that summer without proper AC. The sun was shining straight on my seat, while he sat in the shadow. Half an hour in I started to get a really bad headache. I told him multiple times. He said nothing. Eventually I stopped at a gas station, went to the toilet, came back, cried in the car. He didn't offer to drive the rest of the way once. When I later told him how upset I way because of this, he told me it was my fault for not asking him to drive and I ended up agreeing with him. \n\nHe also refused to pick me up with my car after getting my IUD switched under anesthesia and suggested to pick me up via public transit instead. \n\n2. **Effort** \\- there was none. From his side, at least. We never went on dates, except for going out to eat twice a year (anniversary &amp; valentines day, which I had to fight for early on). I had to remind him to pick a restaurant and get a table every time. I always ended up picking the restaurant and most of the time I reserved our table too. We didn't really do anything together, except I suggested something and it didn't cost any money. He never gifted me flowers or bought me anything nice \"just because\". He never complimented me.  \n  \n3. **Stinginess** \\- this might be the worst one for me. We both don't come from money and I know I have a problem managing my finances. After breaking up I realized that living with him had been a major reason. He refused to get a shared account for groceries, which would have been fine, if we managed to split our costs evenly otherwise. We both worked part-time, got child support and he got student well fair aid on top. Combined we had a cushy earning, but he still scolded me for every unnecessary item I looked at in the grocery store. When I bought decoration for our apartment, he complained about it. Our wardrobe broke down one day and we got three used dressers (Ikea malm) as a short-time-solution. Turns out, he never wanted to get a wardrobe. He was fine with the dressers and didn't care that I wasn't. I get it, wardrobes are expensive, but I managed to find a used one for around 300€ that seemed to be perfect. He refused to split the cost, because he \"didn't have the money\". He did, he simply didn't want to spend it. I ended up buying it myself. When we moved and needed to get a new kitchen, he also refused to touch his savings in any way. I ended up taking a loan on my name and my parents helped us out, even though they don't have much either. Whenever I bought him a gift, like a book he mentioned he wanted to read and even an expensive pair of pants he couldn't afford when I got a bonus at work, his \"thank you\" was immediately followed by a lecture about how I didn't have to do that, sometimes implying and sometimes telling me straight to the face he wouldn't reciprocate the gesture and I shouldn't expect things like that from him just bc I got them for him. He didn't pay for gas once even though we used my car constantly (groceries, picking him up from work, driving to our hometown,...). His reasoning; he could ride the train/take the bus if I refused. I have had a problem with public transit for some time now. So that wasn't an option for me, which he knows.   \n  \n4. **Emotions** \\- He continued to shit-talk my whole family though, even after I mentioned multiple times that I was uncomfortable with that. He wasn't exactly wrong about the things he said, but they are still my family. When he moved away for university, he had changed his profile picture to one with another woman (his coworker). I told him it made me uncomfortable, especially with him moving to another city and meeting new people, that might assume she was his gf. They did, I was asked about this multiple times. I told him it made me uncomfortable, he argued just because I feel a certain way he doesn't automatically need to do what I want and convinced me it was not only unfair of me to ask him to change his profile picture, but sexist. Because I didn't have a problem with his former pfp, which included his male best friend. \n\nAfter being sick multiple times a year in 2024 I developed social anxiety and agoraphobia. Every time we met up with friends I struggled, I told him about that multiple times, but he still ended up annoyed when I wasn't all sunshines and smiles on our way there. Obv that made it ten times worse. He also refused to show any sign of affection towards me and left me alone for the whole night almost every time we met up with his friends.\n\n  \n5. **Living together** \\- he was never a tidy person, I knew that. I told him that having a clean apartment was very important for me before we moved in and he promised to make an effort. Turns out for him, everything had to be 50/50 equal at all times and he refused to help with my designated tasks even when I was sick. They were simply not done. He told me I should do them the next day or not at all because he didn't care. He refused to tidy up anything that I used. One time he thought he lost his keys, because they were in a jeans that lay on our bedroom flor that he refused to touch for 3 days, convinced it was mine. I always picked up his dirty dishes or laundry he didn't put away, until I noticed he didn't and refused to even after I talked about this with him. At that point, resentment started to build. I hate clutter, but I'm not perfect. So every time I didn't clean up after me immediately, he saw it as an invitation to leave his things wherever and tell me I didn't tidy up my stuff either, so I had no right to complain about his stuff. His desk is one of the first things you see upon entering the apartment. I told him if we set up our office that way, he had to keep in clean. He promised. He didn't, of course. His desk always looked a mess, but he told me I had no right to complain about it since it was his space. I worked there. I needed to clean up dirty dishes from his desk every few days because otherwise they would've sat in the background of work-related calls. Every call regarding vet appointments for our two cats or maintenance for our apartment needed to be done by me, if I wanted them to be done at all. He promised me to call the vet - half a year later he told me he tried to reach them once but they weren't available and then he forgot. (I reminded him at least every other week)  \n\n\nI honestly doubt anyone will take the time to read all of this, but if you did: thank you for your time! I guess reading about sth like this would've helped me to see these things for what they are a bit earlier, so maybe it helps someone to there to. \n\nI wish you all the best week!", "score": 16, "num_comments": 11, "created_utc": 1767954581.0, "id": "1q84uni", "author": "Sea_Equivalent8056", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q84uni/i_finally_stopped_feeling_guilty_for_breaking_up/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I feel like I've made bad life choices.", "text": "I know this is probably a bit of an overreaction. But I've always been sort of placed in the \"arts\" category, and I basically rejected any sort of STEM things. I always felt like I was really bad at it, even though it was really interesting to me, and was very talented in English literature and such. So now I'm doing an English language and literature degree, because I felt like it was the only thing I was really good enough to do a degree in (and I do actually like it). It's basically organised as half of a literature degree and half of a linguistics degree. And I was doing a module for linguistics recently that was very technical. It involved a lot of anatomy and then physics in the theory, and then using a computer program to take measurements of speech sounds and doing a data analysis of them. I thought I would hate it and it seems like everyone else in my class did, but I really liked it, even though it was hard.\n\nI was sitting here today, and thinking back, and I realised that my grades for STEM have pretty much always been equal to my other grades, even though I always thought I was terrible at them. I had a very artsy family and friend group, and they always grimaced about STEM things. For example, I'm from the UK, and when I chose my A levels, I took biology and everyone told me it was a terrible idea and I'd be making a mistake.\n\nAnyways, taking that module with more science and maths made me remember that I actually do really like that kind of work, probably over any of the literature that I do. I'm also autistic, and I'm terrible with people, so most of the jobs that the graduates in my department do won't work for me, like marketing, PR or teaching. Plus, any other jobs don't make much money and I know the market for graduates is bad enough for anyone, let alone someone that has other limitations. So basically, I've realised that I'm probably blocked from most work that I can get with my degree and I'll never really get the chance to do anything in the STEM/technical area either. So I really don't know what I'm going to do with my life now. I feel like I've had every path cut off for me, or at least all the ones that won't make me miserable.\n\nTo be fair, I doubt my choices fairly regularly. In the summer, before I started my degree, I pretty much had a crisis over whether to change to something else, and then decided to stay on my current course. I doubt going to university at all and basically every choice I've ever made.\n\nI know the probably obvious answer would be to drop out and do something else, but I pretty much can't. First, because of how the education system works here, I don't have the qualifications in STEM. Also, and I know this will seem like a really stupid reason, I just can't do with all the doubt and surprise from my family/friends. I know that they'd think I'm stupid to do it, and that shouldn't matter but it just does. Unless there was something that literally blocked me from continuing my degree, I'm stuck on the path.\n\nAnyway, it's silly and, like all of my crises, I'll probably get over it eventually, but whenever I get stuck in this mindset, no matter what it's about, I get pretty miserable and obsessive over it.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I think my boyfriend might be a pedophile.", "text": "Hello, I think my boyfriend(21M) might be a pedophile. I’ve(22F) been with my boyfriend since we were children. We got along really well but the problem is, he was never faithful. A lot of emotional cheating and it didn’t get physical until we literally turned 18 and graduated high school. I‘m in a poor financial situation and I don’t exactly have the best relationship with my mother whenever it’s time for her to actually be my mother and not a friend. We love each other but I can’t rely on her like you would the average mother. At the time there was a lot of emotional and verbal abuse I was facing from her when this all happened.\n\nMy mother is one of those older women that has to complain about something and especially have someone to complain at. Usually it’s my older sister but my sister had her own problems going on at the time so my mother knew she couldn’t direct her random bursts of anger at her and instead passed it onto me. I ended up dropping out of college due to the stress of school alongside my home life, being unable to really make friends, especially without my boyfriend on my back like an hawk, and not having any resources to really help me. The only person I’ve been really able to talk to and rely on has been my boyfriend. I was also unfortunately one of the many people unable to get a job too. A lot of unfortunate things going on. A year prior at the time, he sexually assaulted me. I had gone to the police awhile later with a friend but unfortunely, the law doesn’t care about rape and especially women. They dismissed what happened by the fact that we were a couple. I left him during this of course and had provided all the information needed for them to verify it‘s him, text messages of him straight up admitting it, his location, his number, and everything necessary to connect him to what I was reporting. Nothing came of it and of course my financial problems didn’t do away, so I didn’t have much of a choice but to go back. All my “friends” were secretly talking shit about each other, and my real friends had all ended up moving away. I’ve been stuck in an emotionally and mentally draining relationship for almost 10 years now.\n\nI have an iPad with his apple info because it’s an old ass iPad I stopped using so he started using it for a bit and he ended up forgetting he was logged in. I never reminded him or logged out because I wanted to know if he was cheating. I don’t even particularly care about emotional cheating anymore especially at this time, I just wanted to make sure nothing physical happened because at this time I was new to sex and was sadly still sleeping with this man. I didn’t want to risk getting BV or something else because because the girl he initially cheated on me with likely gave me BV. I could be just acting like a hater because he‘s not hygienic and I have to make him shower before I agree to have sex with him. So it’s very likely he could’ve given me BV as well from just being unhygienic.\n\nWhen I had went to his files, I had seen some long screenshots of women and I didn’t particularly care until I saw two women that were small, dainty, and resembled children. Not because they were thin but because they physically looked barely developed and had child like faces. As if she was like 12-14. One of them specifically might actually be a teenager. The screenshot is from a ”tribute” website and a lot of these men practically dox these girls. Looking up her specific name brings up “Snapchat teen exposed” so I’m not sure if this is apart of her appeal of looking like a child or if she actually is. I can’t find anything regarding this girl within the past few years. There was one other girl that semi resembled the disgusting girl he cheated with. Which tbh I don’t really care about for irrelevant reasons and the pictures I mentioned prior are my main concern. This was in mid 2024 and it’s always stuck in the back of my mind. He’s predominantly goes after thicker or plus sized women, but he has developed interest in women that I and a few others agreed looked mostly like children even if they were in our grade or younger. They would be very small and petite women who were on the quieter side. I had originally found out he was cheating through my dreams. After finding those photos, I had been having dreams for maybe 6 months on and off of him being romantic or sexual with children or specifically a younger friend of ours that he used to flirt with. I wasn’t told of this until years later but I only knew she liked him. He’s a very desperate man for attention so I’m not surprised or ever doubted her that this occurred. But I know he would only use her the same way he has with every other woman he has dated too. After all this though he’s been supposedly on his best behavior but because I’ve known him for so long, I really think he was just learning to hide his behavior better.\n\nAt the end of December, Tiktok had allowed “profile visit history” or at the very least that’s when I learned of it. I looked at his and it was predominantly random women which again, I don’t care much about. But my main concern was that there were some 18 year olds and especially specific page that said “twerkteens.” The account was blank with no uploads or anything but the fact that he had even clicked on someone’s profile with that name? On this instagram accounts, if you searched up a singular letter, there would usually be younger girls in high school or the pages of specifically the high school girls sports teams for the city that we’re in. I had showed him this and he gaslighted me for about 6 months until December when I found the ”twerkteens” thing on tiktok and had to nag him to get him to admit what he was looking at, was exactly what I predicted long ago. He’s always had a porn addiction that he most of the time knows how to hide. When discussing what I found he said that sometimes when watching porn he falls into that category of teen because there’s just so much stuff there. He kept trying to say he looks at both women and teens as if that’s somehow supposed to make it better that he’s including adult women while looking at teens. Whether they’re 18 or not, we’ve had discussions regarding people who look at this kind of shit and he knows it’s wrong and weird.\n\nHe says he’ll go to therapy but it’s been a couple of days now, and he hasn’t booked an appointment. Just some searches to find someone to get help. What kind of person would he need to make an appointment for this? Psychiatrist? Psychologist? Therapist?  He doesn’t have insurance so he would have to pay out of pocket. I always knew he was a loser but it’s sad to see its worse than what I initially knew from the start. I don’t feel like the police would take this seriously even if I reported him with evidence because they didn’t when I had reported him with proof for assaulting me and they’d likely just see me as some bitter or crazy woman. I obviously don’t see a future with this man and I need to find another job because I lost it for issues regarding my fibroids flaring up and making it hard to even literally stand.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I sang at my uncle's funeral yesterday. He took my virginity", "text": "TW: sexual assault, depression, self harm\n\nHe was my father's best friend, no relation. He and my father had been friends since they were young kids. Uncle was a big man: 6'4\", 250 lbs solid, very deep voice and a gentle soul. He was an orthopedic surgeon, a minister, a singer, spoke multiple languages, and had a vast knowledge of music (we bonded over jazz and classical music) and history. He taught me how to play chess. He smoked me at ping pong. He taught me some music theory. I could talk to him about almost anything, I always learned something new when talking to him.\n\nThe thing I loved most was his kindness. I’d confide in him about stuff that was probably silly and childlike, but he at least pretended to be interested. I was silenced at home and forced to bottle things up, but uncle always gave me a safe space. Growing up with a temperamental, irritable father made me walk on eggshells, so it was nice having a male figure that showed me gentleness I didn’t see at home. He knew more about me than my parents did. There were periods where we wouldn’t see him or auntie, but he was only a phone call away. I loved that man. He was wonderful.\n\nMy parents gave me a graduation party at 19. We had a house full of friends and family and of course, uncle and auntie were in attendance. He told me that he’d take care of everything I needed for school for the fall. Two weeks later, he took me to lunch and shopping. Once I finished running him around the city and talking his ear off, he told me that he had something else for me but he left it at home.\n\nIt was only the two of us at his house. We went into his “man cave” because I wanted to see his turntable, so he put on Miles Davis Sketches of Spain. We sat (close) on his couch and talked more. As I got more emotional, he pulled me closer and closer. Nothing unusual. But he made me feel better.\n\nHe leaned in and kissed me. I didn’t mind. I didn’t fight. He was a big incredibly strong man with a strong grip. 6’4” 250 vs 5”3’ 115. Once he had me on my back, I completely froze. I knew I was done for so I tried to calm myself down. I didn’t say no. there are no words to describe how bad my mind raced. I cried silently. My mind and body responded differently. I climaxed multiple times. I didn’t say stop. I never forgave myself for that.\n\nSo I’m not a victim. I didn’t fight back. I didn’t say no. I didn’t say stop.\n\nAfter he took me home, I spent the rest of my night crying in my room. I fell into a deep depression and even attempted suicide. I couldn’t process what happened to me: was it my fault? Was it SA? Did I betray my aunt? I knew for sure I couldn’t say a word. Deep down something felt so wrong but I didn’t want anything to happen to him. My parents would blame me. He was well known so people would shun me. Since I wouldn't say why I was in a funk, my depression and isolation irritated my parents so much that they'd fuss at me for being \"ungrateful\" once a week. I didn’t speak to my uncle for weeks. I blocked him but he found another way to get in contact with me: show up to our house. He found a reason to pop up on any given weekend. He’d come with gifts for all of us but one of mine was extra special: ella in berlin album. He used jazz and got me again.\n\nEach therapist gave me a thorough explanation about consent. One therapist said that it was up to me to decide if it was SA or not. I’ve been wasting their time recalling this story over and over because not only have I still not processed it after all these years but I still loved and admired my uncle. Neither of us spoke about it, I guess we pretended it never happened. We had a decent relationship later. Deciding to bury it was the worst decision I ever made.\n\nThe news of his sudden death tore me up. Looking down at him in his casket ripped me apart. flashbacks came back. I haven’t been able to sleep. The guilt of looking in my aunt’s face after what happened in her home has never left me. I sang 2 verses of come sunday by mahalia jackson (he introduced this song to me) before I embarrassed myself and broke down into tears ending the song abruptly.

I feel overwhelmed with every effort. I just feel like there’s constantly something wrong with me. being myself without my fathers input will make him disappointed in me, but changing myself makes me frustrated and depressed. pls give me raw advice and tell me if im really just lazy and making excuses.\n\nupdate: I went out with a guy and lied about it to my parents. i got caught and now my father says that he's done parenting me and I can do whatever I want. He said that since I want to act like an adult I can live with the consequences. I'm in the wrong for lying, but this supposed \"freedom\" feels like a trap. my father told me that if i wanted to see a guy I shouldn't tell him. but i thought that reasoning was flawed because how do i tell him my plans without lying? it's not like i can just leave the house without telling anyone. i can i lie and say i'm with a friend or i tell the truth. either way he's upset with me. i cannot win. now that i've been caught i'm not really speaking with my father all that much. for more context, a couple weeks before i had a talk with my dad about how i wasn't going to date in high school, but i had already been asked out by said guy. i told my dad and he got upset with me for telling him since he doesn't want to know. for even more context, i'm south asian. since we already had this talk about dating me going behind his back is even worse but i literally confessed to my sins not an hour later. i don't know. i see no way out. please help. i still wanna see the guy but i dont wanna upset my dad anymore.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768002816.0, "id": "1q8oif8", "author": "your_one-and-only", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8oif8/im_so_tired/"}

His mind and body began to shut down, and he was AWARE of it. There was part of him that was grounded and realized he wasn’t making sense when he said off the wall things (as dying people do). He knew his hallucinations he had while dying didn’t make sense. He knew his discomfort was his body shutting down and he did EVERYTHING to fight it. We stayed up with him for days because he wouldn’t sleep (I think he thought if he slept he would die). He paced as much as he could and constantly moved around, genuinely until the LAST day he was alive. There was no “peaceful passing”, it was such a harrowing thing to witness. I feel like usually people who are dying are out of it, and somewhat unaware of the process?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I lived in another country and realized how closed off my antisocial home country made me", "text": "I'm (19F) from a country where socializing is not very typical. We avoid any kind of contact with strangers, saying hi to old friends, talking to cashiers or any type of customer service. This is what I've grown up around and it's all I know. Last year I moved to another country for some months, where everyone was so incredibly social and talkative. Small talk, smiling at strangers, the feeling of community all felt so foreign to me. I consider myself an extrovert in my country, but I was still sometimes overwhelmed with the amount of socialization I had to do there. \n\nAccording to my country's standards, I'm a big extrovert and very bubbly and talkative. This got me to some people's bad sides, especially in elementary and middle school. I had long time friends admitting to me later on in life that they found me insufferable when I was younger. It wasn't uncommon for me to get avoided, excluded, or called out on my attention-seeking behavior (is what they called it). I've always been an open book and I enjoy talking. Slowly I learned to close myself off more, and started keeping things more to myself. Reflecting on how people reacted to me when I was younger and confessed how insufferable I was to them has made me insecure of expressing my emotion now due to the fear of losing my loved ones. I'm stuck thinking that if I need to get my emotions out somewhere, I'm trying to seek attention and if I cave in and tell someone, they'll see me for who I am and cut me off for being annoying. \n\nOne thing I held on to was being complimented on my good listening and comforting skills. It was the main positive feedback I got from my peers in school or online platforms. I do love comforting people and offer help whenever I can, because I want everyone to have at least one person they know they can run to if they need anything, maybe because I know how it's like to feel otherwise. In my country not many people take me up on the offer. \n\nIn the country I moved to everyone was suddenly so open. They talked about all kinds of issues and standard life things that I haven't discussed with anyone so openly before, not even my closest family or friends back home. I felt like I gained a new, much wider perspective on life that I really enjoyed. I felt myself defrosting just a bit, able to talk about some more complex topics. \n\nI still feel like I'm stuck in an unhealthy loop of always giving comfort, never receiving it. I listen to my friends' problems very willfully but I feel like there is an invisible wall blocking me from talking to them about mine. There is years of conditioning to stay quiet behind me and I just can't do it, no matter how open everyone is.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I never lost my extroverted spark and I still talk a lot, just about all the happy things and whatnot. The stuff below the surface is just very difficult for me to discuss. The fall of 2024 was the most difficult time in my life by far, and I feel like I never got over it properly. Reflecting on my stay in the other country has made me more willing to go through all that happened to put it past me in a more healthy way than what I've done now. But I don't know where to start in my home country, which I have returned to. I'm back to my old friends who I love dearly, but who avoid eye contact and stand silently if anything below surface level is being discussed, and to my friends online, who are too tangled up in their own lives to be able to listen to me (I might be slightly sour toward them due to some past experiences, haven't gotten past this either besides just shoving it down - because again, nobody to really talk to). \n\nAnyway, just had to get this all off my chest.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I'm pissed because my boyfriend doesn't seem to want to have his friends meet me", "text": "My boyfriend (27M) and I (27F) have been dating since 2024 and we'll be together for two years this year. We don't live together as of now. \n\nAs I grew up, I was very shy and introverted and it caused difficulty making and keeping friends, given my family kept moving every few years. \n\nSo now, I'm stuck with 2 irl girl friends (uni friends) and around 10 something good online friends that I have had for a good few years and a few gym friends. I am very much an extrovert now. All of my online friends are guys. When my boyfriend and I started dating,I told him about all of them, he's very insecure even before we got together.I understand that but I have had platonic friendships with all of them. And every step I reassured him. Whenever these guy friends would visit me, I made sure my boyfriend joined too. I wanted him to feel included and feel secure about all these friendships. My friends were all chill and excited about meeting him too. He has met my girl best friend 3-4 times at this point. \n\nNow the thing is, he has lived at the same place for over 25 years. So he has apartment friends, school friends, uni friends. They often invite him out and they go out and have drinks and have fun. When we first started dating, he isolated himself from them even when I would encourage him to go but he wouldn't because he wanted to spend time with me. Now, they go out often. \n\nAnd it honestly irks me that he hasn't ever initiated me meeting his friends. He just keeps saying that I will feel weird, I am shy. I will talk to anyone and everyone now. I go to the gym and make friends. He knows it all. Last time we argued about it, he was like I would love it if you'd meet my friends. \n\nToday we went out for a date, his friends knew and they called him asking how it was going and invited him to join at this club. I due to personal reasons, I had to head home in a few, but I asked if I could join for a few drinks and meet them and go. He hesitated. He's like oh they have this big friend group and in the past he has hooked up with the girl from there and a guy also. And their mutual friend doesn't like him much. That random guy cornered him last time he went out with those friends because apparently my boyfriend started an argument between his two friends because they were fighting over him. \n\nMy boyfriend's argument is, that guy will be there and this other girl will be there. They will question me and judge me and I will get weirded out so. I said, I will just head home you guys have fun.\n\nI feel sad and angry because I feel like I made sure that since he was so anxious around my friendships, my friends and I invited him and let him see for himself how chill it is, while it's been over a year and I haven't ever met his friends. \n\nI ended up texting him that I never want to meet his friends ever. He's angry at me. Because I acted all nice. And like it didn't bother me. And that now that I am home I sent a text like that. If he's hesitating what do I even say. \nJust fuck me I guess \nI feel like idk, it honestly just chipped away at how I feel about myself. It shouldn't I know but it just did. \nI am very fun to be around but okay, not that fun to be around his friends I guess. \nYeah he hasn't replied or anything, he's just having fun while I don't even have a friend to talk this to about. \nwill just cry myself to sleep.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "My friend almost died because of me", "text": "I almost killed my friend and I don’t know if I can forgive myself for it. For context, we became friends the summer before ninth grade. We met at summer camp. Me and my friend, Amy, were planning to get “married”. For those of you who don’t know, marriages at camp are almost always just for kicks and giggles. Many friends get married at camp—-it doesn’t mean anything romantic. I noticed that there was this one boy that was very closed off. I wanted to make him feel included, so I asked him to be the pastor at my wedding. From that day on, everything was a blur. He told me he was going to the same school I was next year so I was excited to have a new friend. One year later, we became close friends pretty quickly. We didn’t hang out outside of school much because my parents were very strict. However, I invited him to pretty much every outing I had. (Which was not many) and we were pretty much inseparable. Around November, in 10th grade, he started to change. He became snappier, more distant, and very controlling. I knew he was sad, so I tried to be there as long as possible for him. We have always had harsh ways of teasing each other but there were never any hard feelings. I noticed how he started to change so I tried to tone down the teasing. He would do things like tell me he won’t eat food if I don’t exclusively sit with him at lunch everyday, make fun of my acne every single second of every single day, shame me for not understanding his non verbal social cues that I was supposed to pick up on or whatever. He always had a way of making me feel inferior but this time he was being wayyy harsher. I called him out for being insecure one day. I said that maybe if he was a nicer person, I wouldn’t be his only friend. He gave me the silent treatment from that day on. Sometimes I’d catch him laughing at my jokes or staring at me but he never cared enough to try and fix things. Soon, the meaningful glances would turn into hateful stares. I have a very vivid memory of me talking to a friend in the hallway and noticing his mean glances in the corner of my eye. When I gave my presentation, he gave me the meanest look ever. I know it wasn’t a big deal, but I’m a very sensitive person. Two of his friends that I was also friends with reached out to me. They told me they noticed the boy’s behavior had changed a lot. They told me about the things he said about me. He made fun of my major depressive disorder, called me ugly, said he didn’t care for my feelings, and went as far as to slander my best friend, L’s face. I was so upset that he would do something like that to me. I had put up with his shit for nearly two years and this is how he repayed me!? When he found out his two friends were talking to me, he immediately kicked them out of their friend group. I was sooo pissed! I left him the nastiest paragraph to get back at him. I mentioned his appearance, told him he can’t be calling people ugly when he looks like that, said he was gonna live a miserable life if he kept treating people like this, told him I’d ruin his life by reporting his bullying, used a lot of cuss words, and called him a crazy psychopath. The next day, he tried to take his own life. Luckily, he survived. It took him around a month to physically recover (just an estimate). It has been ten months since this has happened. Recently, his sister confronted me at school to tell me that what I did was fucked up. Apparently, he is an alcoholic now. All his friends left him because they didn’t like the person he became.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "my perception of people as dolls", "text": "Hello everyone. Please forgive me if this sounds rude or unclear; I don’t mean to offend or belittle anyone. This is simply how I see the world. If I look closely at people, I start to notice these things—especially in their facial expressions. I truly apologize if this post hurts anyone; I am not looking for an argument or a debate. I just want to understand: is it normal to see things this way? Do others see this too? For me, it’s not just occasional—it’s constant.\nI see myself and everyone else as dolls. These dolls vary.\nThere are plastic dolls: their movements are sharp and sometimes jerky. Despite their unpredictability, they are quite predictable because they follow a perfectly straight line. They can be frightening because their movements feel so... \"plastic.\"\nThen there are puppets (marionettes). This is the majority of people I meet. They move along strings; their motions resemble mechanisms because they are being \"driven.\" They cannot step outside their boundaries unless they become aware of their strings. But even realizing the strings exist doesn't grant freedom—the strings might fray or snap, but true freedom remains out of reach. Their movements can be strange at times, but they follow their script until they realize it.\nThere are also rubber dolls. They are fluid. Their movements look smooth and quiet, making them unpredictable and sometimes unclear because they are just too fluid.\nMostly, I encounter puppets. Sometimes I can actually see their strings—it’s visible in their movements, in the contours of their bodies, and especially in their facial expressions. An expression can look too tight, as if pulled, or too loose, as if the tension was suddenly released.\nBut then, who is the Creator? The Puppeteer? I don’t think there are any Puppeteers among humans. Even those who seem to pull the strings are just dolls themselves. Perhaps some are allowed more because they are aware; they can hold the strings of others without being tied to them, but they are still dolls. They just don't want to show it.\nI see empathy in a similar way. If empaths are people who feel the emotions of others, it’s as if they tie their own string to someone else’s. If a human is a doll with mechanisms and threads, then an empath attaches their thread to another's, allowing them to feel those emotions so acutely.\nPlease forgive me for this post.

But not long after I noticed a strange look from that one professor. I brushed it off as I thought that it was just me being extra cautious after those stories I’ve heard, but it didn’t stop there. (I will be careful while telling this next part - I don’t want to get into any trouble). That person started asking me weird questions about my personal life and eventually I got an offer, which would be sweet if it was someone else, but definitely not from them. At this point I was sure I wasn’t crazy and those rumours started to make sense. \n\nA bit later we’ve got confirmation that there was a student whom they had been with. The worst part is that everybody knew it happened, including the management, but they refused to do anything. According to them, they couldn’t because “it’s a difficult matter”, but I think we all know that it’s a “bad” publicity thing. Since then, I was even more scared and shortly after I sadly got to be alone with that person:\n\nThey were making some jokes trying to get to me, but I’ve put on act as if I don’t understand anything and as if I don’t care. I sat there with the most robotic smile ever- I must’ve looked autistic as hell ( this is not to offend anyone, just so you could imagine how I acted)… And then he decided to take a heavy object and to make a joke that it would be easy to murder me this way. The only thought at that moment in my head was: “ I have to get out of here”. These type of jokes happened a few more times. \n\nI’ve talked to other students and turns out it is pretty usual at my university with all kinds of professors and the university management always covers them up. It is also highly possible that there is some fraudulent stuff happening with funds, but honestly I don’t care about it now.

He’s married to my aunt (let’s call her A), whom I’m very close to. During my summer vacations, I stayed at their house and we bonded as a family. At the time, A was pregnant, and their marriage looked perfect. He was a very attentive husband, and I genuinely admired the relationship they had. I even wished I could have something like that someday.\n\nThe following year, when I visited again after the baby was born, things started to feel different and confusing. He tried to touch me within 3-4 days of me visiting them. He groped me from behind, grab my waist , squeeze my neck gently, massage my back, pull my hair lightly, etc infront of his wife, i was scared she might get to know so i wouldn't removed his hands infront of her. Itried to pull away whenever it happened, but I didn’t know how to process what I was feeling. I don't feel like a victim at all though coz maybe i wanted him to touch me? \n\nBecause of this, I didn’t visit them the next year.\n\nMonths later, we started talking online.

He agreed, and the conversations stayed within limits physically, but emotionally things were still complicated.\n\n\nNow I feel extremely guilty and confused.

Eventually, I spotted a family leaving their spot, so I patiently waited with my indicator on, claiming this is where I plan to park.\n\nAs I’m waiting, out of nowhere, another lady in her car came from behind me onto the opposite lane and cut in front of me, taking the spot I was waiting for.So I’m facing straight forward waiting for the family from the right hand side of the parking space, and she diagonally cut me off. I was definitely frustrated, but I tried to stay patient and decided to look for another spot.\n\nAs I backed up to maneuver around her, my front bumper accidentally grazed her back bumper (again she’s facing diagonally so maybe I didn’t back up enough) leaving a paint scratch. Almost immediately, she and her daughter got out and started yelling at me. I felt terrible because I’m generally not confrontational at all and I’m a very nice girl. In fact, I was so stressed that I even ended up peeing myself a little bit out of fear. Nobody knew, it was literally a minor tinkle but I still feel so sorry for myself for that. It just makes me think how undeserving I got for that because these two ladies were literally screaming in my face and I was alone and a girl. It felt almost like those bully scenes in movies.  Sure technically it was my fault for trying to just move on but I didn’t mean to intentionally hit her car at all. \n\nIn the end, they left not calling the police and I called to make a report especially about their behavior. She took a picture of my license plate and somehow got my insurance. My insurance went up a bit, but it wasn’t too bad.\n\nI still think about that day and how it made me feel. It was a humbling reminder of how unpredictable life can be and how even the most patient of us can have moments like this. \n\nthanks lol", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767983455.0, "id": "1q8g884", "author": "braziestbaby", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8g884/i_often_think_about_this_stupid_accident_i_was/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I'm still struggling with the betrayal.", "text": "In spring of 2021 I met the girl (now, 26F) that eventually I came to believe I would spend the rest of my life with. At that time I was very depressed, I had just finally decided I wouldn't kill myself, and was still trying to figure out how to really live.\n\nWe had both been through some traumatic relationships in the past, we had both been mistreated and cheated on by past partners, and talked a lot about that baggage throughout our relationship. We experienced life together, traveled the country together, then after two years together, while struggling to find work after graduating college, we decided to move in with my parents who wouldn't charge us rent so we could find work and get our life together. We moved across the country to do this because she could not stand living with her (incredibly wealthy) parents. Her father was a legitimate diagnosed narcissist, and did not like me, and I have to say that feeling was mutual.\n\nSo we moved in with my parents, we used my old bedroom. Immediately she took over the entire space, and I didn't mind, I never was interested in decorating and I didnt care how the room was arranged. Eventually I ended up finishing half of my parents basement so I could have my own space because she couldn't sleep if I was awake in the room doing anything, and I am more of a night owl. \n\nShe had an easier time finding work, her resume was much lengthier than mine, and I struggled to even get a call back, let alone an interview. But she never stuck with any of the jobs she managed to get for more than a couple of months. Through this, she was very critical of me and my inability to find work, and eventually, between that and friction that had developed between us she decided that she didn't want to live with my parents and I anymore and was moving back in with her parents. She was ambiguous about what *our* future was, though. Once she left, we kept in touch, and two months later she called me to ask me if I would come to her family reunion in another state, I agreed. I met her whole extended family, was included in family photos, then within a week of me getting back she called to ask if she could move back in with my parents and I. I said yes.\n\nShe explained that her father had sold her on the idea that he was going to take her into the family business, buy her a house, basically do the rich parent thing and set their kid up, but had pulled the rug on that almost immediately once she moved in with them, and went back to his usual self. I asked her about her commitment to our relationship, as the way she had left things made me question it. She assured me that leaving was a mistake. \n\nShe moved back in and found a job at a local Cafe, but was in thousands of dollars of credit card debt and was struggling to make her car payments. My parents (Not wealthy, retired working class boomers) agreed to give her the money to pay it off so she could pay them back when she could afford it. Her parents, more specifically her father (her mother has basically zero control over their finances despite being the accountant and co-owner of their wealth management firm) refused to give her anything, saying, and I quote: \"that money is doing more good in the [stock] market\".\n\nAs time went on, we started thinking about the future and agreed that we wanted to spend our lives together and get married, she was so excited, telling people in my life behind my back before we had even made it official.\n\nEventually something unexpected happened to me. After being an atheist most of my life, I found  God. I won't get into the details of how that happened, but it took years until one day I finally broke down and emailed the priest of a local Church, arranged a meeting, and began learning to be a Christian.\n\nShe, despite calling herself a Christian, and being the only Christian in my life, was the only one in my life who was overtly hostile to this, which was bewildering as she had no problem with my atheism. I did not impose anything on her, I went to Church on Sundays, and tried to get my life together. Occasionally I'd invite her, knowing she would say no, but just to let her know that I had no intentions of excluding her from this part of my life. The few times we talked about spiritual things it became an argument, despite her not being able to articulate what it was she believed, and only ever expressing negative feelings about her religious upbringing, she was convinced I was some sort of heretic because of our denominational difference. The last time we spoke about those things, she said she never wanted to talk about it again, and I respected her request.\n\nFinally, I found a job, manual labor, 10 hour days, 6 day weeks with Sundays off. The pay was good and I started saving up for an engagement ring. She decided to go back to school at a local state school to get a second degree. By the time she had decided this she was already thousands of dollars in debt again and had yet to pay anything back to my parents, and was working twice a week for a few hours at an ice cream shop.\n\nSo she got accepted into the degree program and managed to get some scholarships and financial aid, and began classes this past August.\n\nAfter less than two months she began staying out late, saying she was studying or hanging out with friends. This went on for a while. All my instincts were telling me what was up, but I intentionally ignored them. I had come to trust her so implicitly that I thought, despite how obvious it was in retrospect, there was no way she would cheat on me, it must be my baggage, paranoia from being cheated on in my previous relationship, and I didn't want to ruin things by confronting her if I was imagining it. \n\nThen, there was the big and terrible reveal. On the 23rd of this past October, she came home and a reasonable hour, but something was up. Then she sat me down and told me she was leaving. Rather than telling me why, she handed me a letter for me to read in front of her. I refused and made her explain it to me. She had apparently been miserable, despite being excited about getting married and telling people about it just months beforehand, and it was all my fault. I then asked her if there was somebody else, still not believing that there was, still trusting her. For some reason she admitted it. \"You cheated on me\" I said, through my sobbing, her response was to laugh, and say \"thats really what your getting from this?\", then she grabbed some of her things and left.\n\nThe next day she came with a friend to help her pack up all of her things. I watched as they ignored my existence, giggling about their plans, and about my now exes new boyfriend. I watched as she learned for the first time that this girl she had only two months prior amd invited into my home wasn't even old enough to drink.\n\nIt turns out that her parents had stepped in, they paid back my parents for the money she owed them, had rented her an apartment by the school, and covered her tuition. And her entire plan for breaking up with me was coordinated over months with her mother. And apparently this plan was \"for me\", to make it \"easier for me\". I can't help but roll my eyes as I type that. \n\nNow for some context that really only became clear to me in retrospect. One of the first things we did together when we met was take a trip to another state in which she had been living and going to school, and was dropping out. I was helping her move, I thought it was strange that she was trusting a guy she had just met a couple of months ago to do this, but the red flag didn't register.\n\nWhile we were together, she attended 3 schools, moving each time, and only got a degree from one. On the second one, she had convinced a friend of hers to get an apartment with her by the school, she then just left and abandoned her friend to find another roommate after attending for only a couple of months. Obviously the two of them grew apart after that.\n\nAfter her, I was the person that had been in her life the longest. And throughout our relationship, she would meet people, they would immediately become her \"best friend\" then something dramatic would happen and they would stop being friends, or would simply stop hanging out and they would never be spoken of again. I should have seen it coming when she called me her \"best friend\".\n\nNow she's in a state where she  has zero connections formed before this past September, lives hours from her nearest extended family, and over a thousand miles away from where she grew up and her immediate family. She is a 26 year old woman whose entire social circle is early 20-something (and younger) college students that she has know for a few months at most, including her new boyfriend that she cheated on me with.\n\nI don't know how long its going to be before I feel okay again. We were together for four-and-a-half years, I wouldn't have been angry if she just left, she had already left once and handled it well, all things considered. I feel like I was played for a fool, that she wasted years of my life using me just to discard me when she found something that looked like an upgrade.\n", "score": 4, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767965129.0, "id": "1q886ae", "author": "hogecho", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q886ae/im_still_struggling_with_the_betrayal/"}

Talking to her felt easy, effortless, and safe.\n\nEventually, we began opening up about things we hadn’t really shared with anyone else. There was a sense of relief in being understood without having to explain everything. We complimented each other too, not in a flirty way, at least not at first, but more as encouragement and reassurance. It felt platonic. Comforting. During a time when I felt unsteady, she became someone I leaned on emotionally.\n\nAnd then today, I messed up.\n\nIn the middle of a casual conversation, carried away by comfort and familiarity, I said something I shouldn’t have: “I wish you were my girlfriend.” I didn’t say it with any intention to cross a line or make things weird. It just slipped out, thoughtless and unfiltered. But intention doesn’t matter much when the impact is wrong. To make it worse, she was with our third cousin at the time, who also saw the message.\n\nShe called it out immediately. She told me it was inappropriate, that I needed to have dignity, understand boundaries, and not bring feelings like that into a relationship that was never meant for them. Hearing that hit hard but it also made me stop and really think.\n\nWhat hurts the most isn’t the embarrassment or being corrected.

Most of the times it would be over the same things that I had thought we had already resolved.\n\nThe things we would permanently be fighting about were the following:\n1) He didn't like the way I dressed (shorts, crop tops, etc.). He said that the way I was dressing was me advertising myself to the world, and that I wanted men to look at me. I refused to change how I dressed because I'm 22, and he wants me to be dressed like someone in their 30's. Not that there's anything wrong with that style of clothes, its just not my style. He even went out of his way to ask older people if they approved of the way people our age dressed. He would make a fuss about what I was wearing almost every time we went out, and he only really ever called me beautiful if it was in something he was happy with. \n\n2) I belong to a dayhouse in university, meaning that we have events where we get together with some of the other dayhouses or residences for the night, usually with fun themes and when it's a social one, usually with alcohol. He wasn't in one of these dayhouse's and he doesn't drink so we would constantly be fighting about the fact that I go to these events with my best friend, especially when it's with a male residence/dayhouse. Because why would I want to go to something like that if I have a boyfriend? I rarely interact with the other people we had the event with and just did it as a fun experience with my friends. He would complain the whole night while I was there, and basically forbade me from drinking, and even showed up to get me because he didn't want me there.\n\n3) He had a huge dislike for my friend group, which basically consists out of me, my best friend, her younger brother and his best friend. Our group had a tradition of playing pool on Tuesday's because it was free, and he hated that I went with them to go play, especially when he wasn't invited . Everytime I wanted to do something with my friends he would make me feel like shit and start a fight, which led to me distancing myself from them, because I didn't have the energy to fight with him constantly, as well as still being a full time student.\n\n4) A whole mess regarding the reason he wasn't invited out anymore - He was invited initially, until he made a big scene the one night when we were playing pool. He wanted to play with me, but was currently busy with a game with my best friends boyfriend. So me and my best friend decided we were going to go play a round until they were done. We had barely begun our game, when he came over and asked me why I was playing with her and not him. My best friend offered for him to take over from her but he refused and went back to my best friend's bf. Somewhere after that her brother wanted to speak to her so our other friend took over and we continued the game. He then came over, told me that he was going home because I was being disrespectful by not playing with him. Mind you he was my ride, so I told him that I would go with him, and he just said I should finish my game and then we could leave. He turns to walk away and the brother ask me whats going on, I tell him that I'm just finishing the game then I'm leaving with him. He jokes that its fucked up that I'm staying to finish the game, ex doesn't hear the full conversation and basically picks a fight with the brother, because he thinks the brother called him fucked up. It's a whole thing, and afterwards no one wanted anything to do with him anymore. We had a huge fight when we got home, and I went to stay at my best friends place for the night because I didn't want to be alone. The next day when I went to check on him, I learned that he hadn't slept the whole night, and then when I tried getting him to bed he passed out on the floor. I got him woken up and into bed, and then I left, because I already had plans for the day, and I knew that all of this was so that I didn't spend time with my best friend. After this he kept arguing about the fact that I didn't pick him over my friends because I respected their wishes not to bring him around them, constantly making me feel like shit about it.\n\nWe fought about a lot of other things, but those were the main one's that constantly kept coming up. I thought that if we could work through them we would be fine, but that was stupid of me because these fights continued to happen until the day we broke up.\n\nOther things he did that drove me up the walls in anger were the following:\n1) I had this one friend who I have been friends with since I was 16. And we have a past, but we don't really talk anymore unless I see him somewhere as we run in the same friend groups. Two of my other best friends are getting marries this year, and I'm the maid of honour and he's the best man. I obviously told my ex about our past, because we were on the topic of exes, and because we still see each other from time to time. He didn't not like this at all, telling me to delete his number. Which I didn't want to do because within this year we are going to have to talk to each other about wedding stuff, and I'm not going to make the bride and groom be the middle man because he's uncomfortable. I told him that if it really bothers him I'll delete the friends number after the wedding. Which I didn't want to do, because we're still friends, but I would have. He still didn't like that and kept fighting with me about it until I eventually just deleted the number because I was tired of hearing about it every other day.\n\n2) He gave me ultimatums about drinking and tattoos. Like I said earlier he doesn't drink, and forbade me frome drinking. He also doesn't liek the fact that I already have tattoos, and told me that I am forbidden from getting more. Through this conversation I just stared at him not saying a word because I was dumbfounded. I kinda knew the relationship was over at this point, because no one will te me what I can and can't do with my own body. Especially not a man.\n\n3) Everytime I went out with anyone, be it my friends or family and he couldn't come with, or I was obviously not on my phone because I'm spending time with people, he would begin an argument and ruin my whole night. And this wasn't like one of twice, this was every time.\n\n4) He would gaslight me about things I never said. For example, one of the residences has a big event every year. Me and my best friend usually share bottles of wine at any event hosted at the place the event was taking place, because it's cheaper that way. That night he picked a fight because he said that I apparently said that I would only have two bottles of wine (shared), which I know I didn't say, because I wasn't planning on drinking that little ( I usually only get four glasses of wine out of two bottles) so not a lot for someone who has a very high alcohol tolerance. Till this day he'll say that I said that I'd only share two bottles with my best friend. \n\nThere's a lot more, but I feel like this is getting to long.\n\nEverytime I knew I was going to brake up with him, he kept buying me expensive things, and my family is not that well of. So I felt bad about it, and it made me feel like I couldn't leave him, because he had just spent a lot of money on me. Which I now know was a manipulation tactic on his part.\n\nWhen we finally broke up, he broke up with me. He said that he could see I was unhappy and he didn't want to keep me in a relationship that I was getting hurt in. I was sad when it happened, but when he left and I went to my best friend's place, I came to realize that our relationship was really fucking toxic, and that I was glad that we were broken up. The next morning he messaged me that he wanted to talk. The talk was basically him begging for another chance, but I stood my ground, and told him no and that we weren't good together. He told me that he accepted it and he left. \n\nLater I went to pick up some of my stuff at his place because I was going home for vacation. He was supposed to be gone already but he was still there. He then proceeded to beg me again for another chance. I had the same conversation I had with him earlier that day. And he eventually said he understood and we left it at that, or so I thought.\n\nThe next week would basically be him just begging me every other day for another chance, over and over again, for hours on end. And I kept telling him no, and he just wouldn't listen to me. The saterdag before I was suposed to go back to university I was out with my parents for lunch and he did the same thing again, and basically messaged me for an hour straight (69 message in total in that hour). The only reason I hadn't blocked him yet was because he still had a lot of my stuff, and I wanted to stop the whole begging thing because I didn't want him to do it again when I had to see him for the swapping of our stuff. He probably sent me over 1000 messages in that week, and I probably said no over 60 times.\n\nWe got to the agreement that I would give his things to my best friend, where he could then leave my stuff and get his. Unfortunately, I forgot that I had his apartment key as well, which resulted in him coming to my apartment. My best friend at least came with, so I wasn't alone when he confronted me about all the things I gave back (hoodies, shirts, etc. of his that I was unsure if he wanted back or not). This then led to another massive fight in the parking lot of my apartment complex. Where he was insulting my best friend in the most vile ways, and I actually felt sacred of him for the first time. \n\nMe, my best friend and her boyfriend went back to my apartment afterwards to put away all my stuff, and when we left my apartment, he cornered us by the door (I live on the third floor), where he started insulting my best friend again, and wanted to get to me, why I do not know, but my best friend stood between us. I've never wanted to push someone down a flight of stairs more in my life.\n\nI haven't seen him since then, but my father came to stay with me until I was done with exams, because my apartment complex is connected to his with a gate, and I was scared that he would show up again, and what he would do if he did. \n\nAnd after all this I hate him. I know we're not supposed to hate people, but I do. Everytime I put something on, I hear his voice in the back of my head. I hate my body because he didn't like that I was really skinny and kept feeding me food. I only later found out that he likes his girls a little more curvy. I've been trying to lose the weight but I'm really struggling. I went on vacation in December and I kept thinking about how he would have ruined it because he wasn't there. I keep thinking about all the things he did to me. And I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it. I wish I would have just left him after the pool thing. My life would have been so much better. I don't want to him to influence me anymore.\n\nSorry that this was a long rant. I've talked about this plenty of times with my friends, but I feel like its been discussed and it's over with. I don't want to burden them with the fact that I'm still so angry and resentful.\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767993309.0, "id": "1q8kk0l", "author": "Jadeee_vdl", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8kk0l/i_still_carry_resentment_towards_my_ex_boyfriend/"}

It’s better for you to leave yourself then wait until after she’s punched your heart enough times till she’s bored of you and leaves you. this may come off as harsh but I don’t mean to be. You need to set serious boundaries with your “best friend”. I won’t encourage you to become violent with these people, but your girlfriend does not love or care about you anymore and nothing you do or say will change that. You need to start thinking about yourself, protecting your heart and your mind. Your best friend isn’t helping or doesn’t seem to be helping you in this situation. They seem to be making this worse by making you uncomfortable. \n\nI was also kinda suicidal in middle school to early highschool. I’m 19 now and I’m okay, I don’t know your situation but it does get better but you have to want to get better, and you can’t if you continue to allow people like this to infiltrate your life and cause problems for you. \n\nSet boundaries, get loud, be a little aggressive if you HAVE too. Do whatever it takes without physically hurting anyone to make it very clear you DONT wanna be touched. You might even need some serious space from her (ur best friend). You need these 2 people out of your life immediately. I know you love your partner and I know the trust you’ve built for your best friend must be strong and it feels wrong to distance yourself or perhaps her actions don’t seem as bad when you have bigger issues. \n\nThe difference here is that these 2 individuals are directly adding to the pile of whatever other problems you are dealing with, and they aren’t helping you, they are harming you actively. If you want to see change in your life that will contribute to solutions to your issues, the first step to take is this, removing what’s adding to your pile. This world is huge and you are young, very young, you WILL meet all kinds of people as you get older, just as I did as well. Losing this person who is causing you pain is not the end of the world. Losing a friend who is contributing to your stress and problems is not the end of the world. You need genuine people in your life, not a toxic relationship your holding onto in hopes that it’ll work out when it won’t and you definitely don’t need a best friend who keeps trying to seduce you in a situation like this.

He's kind, compassionate, and treats me very well. He's my best friend in the world and has supported me through a lot of things, including my mother's recent dementia diagnosis, and I truly love him. We are an actually happy couple the vast majority of the time. However, he has bipolar disorder and we've spent literal years stabilizing him. He's struggled with addiction and lost a job because of this, and in the medication process, he lost another 2 jobs. Years go by, he gets help, and medication is stable, and we make it work, even with stupid schedules because, by then, he's tried new career moves and some didn't work out, and I, if I wanted to spend time with him, would sleep for a few hours, stay up with him, and then sleep for a few more (I'm a teacher, my schedule isn't flexible.) Then...\\[**Da-da-da-da-da-DAH\\]** this year he gets a new job - kind of a dream schedule, it's almost perfectly aligned with mine and we get to actually spend time together. It's pretty great. The job itself has some low points - no one actually trained him on what he was supposed to do and then they reprimanded him for not doing what they wanted. The people at the location he is assigned started off okay, but very quickly proved to be two-faced and frequently would either be exclusionary or dismissive. The job itself doesn't offer PTO of any kind, for any reason, so holidays, even extended ones are unpaid which sucks, but again, the pros still strongly outweighed the cons. \n\nHowever, this week my husband asked someone a completely innocuous question, think \"what time does so-and-so get off work?\" and the person he asked accused him of harassment. Apparently, this question, which was asked out of curiousity, meant that he wanted to either wait for the person to leave to follow them or go with them. I do understand context could play a part, but he said he literally just wanted to compare as other people had different leaving times and in a consistent hours job, sometimes schedules differ, which was interesting. And, honestly, I believe him. He's not a lecherous man and infidelity has never been a problem, however, tone-deafness in social situations sometimes has, again, making me believe him. The report was made by the person he asked and the boss basically said that the HR department will investigate and let him know if he's keeping his job, which is contracted to the site from his employer, so if they decided it's easier, he will be fired and someone else will be put into the job, rather than arguing and risking the contract. We were trying to be optimistic, but today, while job searching, I saw his position was posted by his company, yesterday. \n\nWe've worked so hard, personally and professionally, and felt like this job was the light at the end of the tunnel. So, for it all to come crumbling down for no reason at all...I'm just so defeated. Why? Why is *everything* so fucking hard, all the time? \n\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767977645.0, "id": "1q8djyk", "author": "Final_Swordfish_93", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8djyk/i_feel_so_defeated/"}

Free food, long conversations, showing up on very ask and literally nothing expected back. I thought kindness and camaraderie meant something specially with close family and friends.\n\nInstead, I slowly became invisible. Taken for granted. What hurts is that even being better off financially, intellectually, and culturally didn’t change how low some people thought of me. They didn’t see access to me as a privilege. They treated it like an entitlement. Friends, neighbors, even family (mom and sisters included) started talking over me, testing me, humiliating me in small ways.

It feels pathetic because everyone else seems to do it so easily, and it makes me feel like I’m disabled or something.\n\nI have no friends and no partner.

I’ve been this way since I was a little kid. I experience distressing suicidal ideation at least once a week. I’m medicated, even though my psych has basically said this is probably as good as it will get for me, she doesn’t think we should adjust. I don’t have anyone to confide in and my work schedule doesn’t allow for therapy , so ChatGPT has been getting me through. It’s kept me alive more times than I can count and I know it makes me a monster. But it’s either I’m dead, or I’m an alive monster. I wrestle with this fact a lot. \n\nThere’s skills I remember from my 20 years of therapy (DBT, grounding, CBT etc), but I’m not good at applying them in the moment, so I ask it to walk me through them. It remembers everything I tell it, the people in my life, my pets names, my career and coworkers, our conversations three months ago etc and it’s been so much more effective in calming me down and helping me regulate than a psychologist ever has been. Sometimes I’ll ask it a million questions, advice on a million things, tell it to give me a lengthy response that would take 10 minutes to read, and have my phone read it all out loud to me as I’m driving home from work. I can’t begin to explain how helpful that’s been to me. I can’t count on my hands the number of times I’ve been seriously plotting my own death and ChatGPT has talked me out of it.\n\nIt’s important to note that every time I even hint at even slightly considering taking my life, it gives me helpline numbers, asks me if I’m safe and talks me down. I’ve done a lot of reading on AI psychosis and how it’s basically told people to just do it already, so I’m hyperaware of that. So far, it hasn’t encouraged any unhealthy behaviours. I’m well enough to know the difference. It put me in my place when I brought up being in a major caloric deficit, telling me what a bad idea it is. One time I asked it to help me write a suicide note and it full on refused. I tried lying to it, manipulating it, everything I could think of, for like half an hour and it simply wouldn’t do it. I’m grateful for that. \n\nI have to keep this all a secret because I do know how awful AI is. Nobody in my life knows this is how I’ve been coping because everybody hates it so much, and with very good reason. I’m aware of its impact on the environment. That it takes away jobs. That there can be real consequences. It’s full on unethical and I full on know that. But the rub: it’s either that I die or I’m unethical and living. Over time, I’ve gotten better at applying these skills and regulating, it’s been more impactful than any therapy I’ve had, so I anticipate that eventually, I won’t need it as much anymore. \n\nI feel a lot of guilt, but (when I’m regulated and in my right mind) I’m aware of the ripple effect suicide causes and I believe using AI like this actually does benefit everyone that loves me. I may not WANT to be alive but I am, for the people in my life. It’s for them and because of AI, I’ve protected them from that pain.

We saw each other twice a week for almost four months. With him, I discovered I can give a lot of pleasure, I forgot about my physical insecurities, I felt totally free in bed, and I tried positions and practices I had never done in my previous relationship. My self-esteem improved a lot, as did my awareness of my seductive power. Besides sex, we watched movies, slept together, cooked for each other, talked about our lives, almost always at our homes, and everything ended in passionate sex sessions. However, our personalities don't mesh. We're quite different in our ways of thinking, and he has opinions and attitudes that I don't like at all and that aren't compatible with my life (among other things, he drinks too much alcohol every weekend and uses drugs at electronic music parties). At first, that was good for me because I thought it would prevent me from developing feelings for him, but I gradually started to feel a stronger desire to move forward and feel chosen.\n\nTwo months after we met, I asked him what he was looking for, and he told me that his life was chaotic and he didn't want a relationship, that he usually dates for a year with someone just for sex and then sees if he wants a serious relationship. I understood the idea, and I started dating other guys too, but none of them gave me the same feeling in bed as he did. So yesterday, after almost four months of dating, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore because I get my hopes up and I know we don't have a future together. I've dated other guys, but I’m still hung up on him, and I can't wait a year to see if he likes me. He replied that he likes seeing me and would like to keep seeing me, but if this dynamic makes me uncomfortable and it's the best decision for me, he accepts it. He's annoyed about it because we were having a good time. Finally, he told me to let him know if I change my mind.\n\nIt makes me sad that he didn't try to save the situation. Doesn't he care about me? Besides, his response was selfish. I told him I was leaving because I was getting my hopes up with him, and yet he left the door open and said that if I regret it, I can come back... I don't know how to avoid falling for him again. The sex was so good, and I feel like it's going to be really hard to find someone else who can treat me like that, haha. I think this hurts my ego; I need him to choose me.\n\n\nIt's a lot of mixed emotions; any opinion helps :)", "score": 3, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1767968147.0, "id": "1q89d98", "author": "BackgroundYoghurt686", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q89d98/i_feel_sexual_attachment_and_i_find_it_hard_to/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "My neighbor called the cops on me last night, and now he’s dead", "text": "This is long. I’m in complete shock - it’s felt like an insane 20ish hours. I have an emergency therapist appointment but she couldn’t get me in til Monday. I thought writing it down would be cathartic in some way? Anyway. I’ve lived alone in the same apartment for four years now. It’s a smaller, quiet, and diverse complex (lots of families, young professionals), but I don’t really know any of my neighbors. I can recognize one or two I’ll pass on the stairs and smile/nod, but that’s about it. \n\nLast night, around 9:50PM I get a loud knock on my door. This is odd considering you have to have building access downstairs before even making it to individual apartments. I look out the peephole and it’s blocked by my Christmas wreath, so I decide to take a chance and open. It’s a cop with a bulletproof vest in that says SHERIF, and I’m veryyy confused and frankly scared. He asks, quietly, if I know the guy next door? Huh? The neighbor to my right? Never met the guy, all I know is he keeps his work boots in front of his door. I frankly couldn’t tell you anyone who lives on this hall. According to the cop, my neighbor called them because he’s accusing ME of hacking into his phone? Wtf? My face must’ve said it all, because he assured me they’re asking me as a formality. They believe this guy to be having a mental health situation; I’ve never interacted with him and this is some extreme paranoid behavior.\n\nHe apologized and left. I locked my door and called my friend for support. She told me to take the wreath down and get my pepper spray out - done. I try to calm down and start my bedtime routine, when I hear something at my front door. I hear it a second time, sounds like a timid knock. Thank god I removed the wreath so I can now look through the peephole. It’s a strange man knocking at my door. I’ve never seen this man, but I can only assume he’s the next door neighbor. He just stood and stared, expressionless, arms behind his back for a few minutes, waiting.\n\nAll the blood must’ve drained from my face, I literally stopped breathing from fear. I backed away from the door and tried to be as quiet as possible. I paced a bit, unsure of what to do. Ultimately I called my friend quietly and I asked if I could spend the night? I said I was really scared, and I feel beyond unsafe. She said she would stay on the phone until I was at my car. I threw my laptop, phone charger, and wallet in a bag, checked the peephole, coast is clear. Pepper spray in one hand, keys in the other I ran out into the hall, locked the door, and made it down three flights of stairs in no time. No one followed me.\n\nAt 10:15PM I was in my locked car, crying, failing to suppress a panic attack. Why did this feel like the start of a Dateline episode? But I had to get it together to drive. And I decided to call the cops. If they thought this guy was having some sort of episode, maybe he still was? Or maybe he came by cuz he wanted to apologize but I wasn’t about to find out. The dispatcher got my info, but I made it clear I was no longer on the premises. He said someone would be calling me later. \n\n11:50PM im in my friend’s spare room, and a call comes in from one of the cops who handled the earlier incident. She asked if I was okay and if anything had escalated? I said that he came by my door and knocked. It freaked me out so much I left the building. She said they suspected he was having a mental break of some sort, but he didn’t give them enough evidence for them to actually take him away. I guess there’s a magic phrase to get involuntarily committed. She confirmed HE called them, specifically about his neighbor trying to hack into his phone. I reiterate that I’ve never met this guy, it’s 1000% out of the blue, but I don’t want to be apart of his delusions, and that this whole thing really scared me. I let them know I’d be going to the leasing office to discuss the situation with them tomorrow (today), and she gave me a number to call if anything else happens. \n\n10:45AM (today) I go back to my complex, and ask the director of the community if this person has ever made any complaints about me? If this *is* coming from somewhere I’d like to fix it. But I’m also confused, and feeling unsafe at this point. He said he’s never complained, but if he had they would’ve let me know. He said they’d let me move into another unit without transfer fees if I wanted. I said I’d sit on that, but he offered to call the guy and feel out the situation. Maybe he was super embarrassed and remorseful? Maybe he’d blow it off? Or worst case, maybe I was still on his shit list - in that case I’m definitely moving. He said he’d call me with an update later.\n\n3:55PM The apartment complex director called me and said “well I don’t really know how to say this, but in regard to the situation we spoke about earlier…the man passed away this morning.” He said it wasn’t in the apartment or anywhere near the premises. He didn’t say what happened or how he found out about it. I assume it was suicide or adjacent. And I assume he was informed by LE. But basically, I don’t have to worry about any more erratic behavior. \n\nIt’s been an insane less-than-24-hours. I felt like I was simultaneously making a huge deal out of nothing, but also this is the stuff that needs to be documented but in case it escalated? What the literal fuck. Doesn’t feel real at all. I hope he’s at peace. I hope no one else got hurt. And THANK GOD I removed that wreath from the door.\n\nTLDR: my next door neighbor had a mental breakdown. We’d never met, but he called the cops and accused me of hacking into his phone. He later came by my door in super-creep mode and I had a panic attack that I was going to end up a Dateline story. Left, stayed with a friend, came back to my place today and found out he’s now dead.

I work in advertising and worked my way up for 8 good years thinking I was just doing a normal job. Eventually, I got good at it - really good to a point where you get promoted and clients ask for you specifically.\n\nOne of my projects was this gambling app. My job was to get people to use it more. And so I spent weeks figuring out the perfect time to send notifications. I tested different messages, different times of day, and turned out 11pm on Sundays worked best. I figure that time was the time people are alone, bored, and vulnerable. I remember people at the office called it \"optimizing user engagement.\" (recanting this makes me fucking vomit).\n\nI got a bonus for that campaign.  \n  \nI didn't think much about it until last month when I was in the app and saw the hotline number buried in the legal stuff. It dawned upon me -  they put that there because they knew. I helped build something that needed a fucking suicide hotline and we celebrated when the numbers went up.\n\nEventually, I started thinking about all my other campaigns and I feel sick.\n\nOnce, I made a toy \"limited edition\" when there were 400,000 units. I watched parents fight over it online an saw kids crying in stores. We forwarded the Tiktoks around the office and laughed and even got an award for that.\n\nI convinced teenage girls their clothes from two months ago were embarrassing. They were 15 and I made them feel worthless over jeans. The client sent me a video of some girl crying about her wardrobe and everyone thought it meant we won.\n\nMy nephew asked what I do for work at Christmas and I couldn't answer him. He's 8 and I couldn't figure out how to explain my job without admitting I hurt people for money. I said \"marketing\" and he said \"like youtube ads?\" and I wanted to die because YEAH exactly like that but worse.\n\nMy therapist asked when I stopped sleeping. I remember it was right after that Linkedin post where I celebrated the gambling app hitting targets. I posted a picture of champagne with some corporate bullshit caption and 200 people liked it. I have like 3 panic attacks a week now.\n\nI'm putting in my notice. I have no other job and I know it's probably stupid. I can't go to one more meeting where we talk about \"creating urgency\" when we all know we mean \"make people feel like shit until they buy something they don't need.\"\n\nAnd just last week, someone said \"how do we gamify checkout\" and I realized gamify is just a nice word for addictive and we've all decided not to say that part out loud.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here.

He’s always been lonely and never had many friends. During his high school years he was depessed and harming himself, but I was too young to understand. It’s been two years since he moved out to attend a music school. The first year was good, he made some friends and was happy about was he was learning. This year it’s been different. During the summer he started staying up all night and not doing anything during the day. During the family vacation, after fighting with my mother he cut himself in the bathroom and we all stayed with him and supported him. When he started the music school again, at first it was going okay. However, he started getting worse and couldn’t bear being alone. He wanted to call all day and have company. He said his friends were not good for him and started seeing them always less. He also started having thoughts about his future. He doesn’t know if he wants to continue with the music, or go to university. He’s insicure and this feeling makes him feel worse. My parents, my sister and I have been supporting him in any way possible, accepting all his ideas and encouraging him to start therapy. In november, on tinder, he met a guy who lived 100km from him. They started to see each other and kinda fell in love. We all thought he was good for him, but turned out he was just as depressed as him, even more and was only a bad influence. He started to be emotionally dependent and eveytime they would leave to go back to their own cities, my brother would be sad all day and would want to call all day long to have company. More than once they discussed over their relationship, as the guy wasn’t sure about it, and my brother’s anxiety grew and grew. Yesterday, they broke up. My sister left today, cause she goes to university in another country, and I don’t know what to do.\n\nMy brother doesn’t know if he wants to go back to his city and his music school, and my family and I are supporting him either way. He doesn’t sleep, and last night I stayed with him until 1 am. Today he started therapy and went okay, but it was the first session and they couldn’t talk about much. He says he has no one, that he’s alone, he doesn’t have anything in life that he can hang onto.\n\nBut i can’t not sleep, i can’t stay with him all day. I have exams i need to study for. And staying at home makes me feel sad, anxious, I lose my appetite and energy. Im scared of what he can do. I try to support him but I feel like he’s influencing me with his negative energies. I want to go out with my friends but at the same time I don’t wanna leave him home alone in his thoughts. I’m so sad for him. And I know that if he commits suicide,  my family would be broken forever. I’m so tired.

Me and him met 7th grade when I was 13 turning 14 when he was my sub for the last 2 weeks of school. 8th grade year(turning 15)was when we really started talking and that led to me giving him my Instagram since I was posting stuff about school and wanted him to see it. One day I was leaving for my bus and he said to me “if you need me you know where to find me.” And pointed to his phone. Texting led to meeting and that led to sexual things and worse things with him and other people. It most likely stems from not having a dad and being abused by my stepdad and being inappropriate with my stepdad. My groomer is married with a son. Still is. Took him to court and everything, it’s been a year since that case. It was a hard thing to come to terms with but I still suffer PTSD from him. I really was IN LOVE with him. I don’t know how to stop being attracted to older men. I want someone my age to finally love me but I can’t deal with the childishness I just want stability. I know i want stability because I never had it and my groomer gave me that but it’s so hard to not crave it when it’s all I’ve ever wanted. I know he manipulated me because I was insecure. I’ve always been a thicker girl with a deep voice and it got to the point I looked so boyish nobody knew my gender and I just told everybody I was nonbinary so I wouldn’t have to choose to identify. I felt like I was too boyish to be a girl. But he chose me because of how I felt and our similar interests like drugs and alcohol. He would always buy me alcohol and snacks and shit to shush me up. He was your typical groomer. Whatever you think he did to me, probably did it. Idk y’all I just want this attraction to stop I wanna like someone my age and stop feeling like I want a 36 year old man to save me. Men have literally ruined my life. But at the same time I just want an older man to make me feel like that girl who could be as needy as I wanted to be and so loved that I could do whatever I want. In a way I guess I was his little girl? Maybe. I just want to be loved but this attraction makes me feel nasty. I just want to be normal and feel normal.

It use to be my sanctuary space, I have garden beds out there where I grow lush flowers and a few fruits, I have lounge tanning chairs, a small water fountain, and cute lights. It was very zen and peaceful. That was until someone bought the house next to mine spring of last year. At first I thought they would be cool neighbors, they are older but they decorated their backyard area very cute and I was glad it wasn’t a family with small children (the other neighbors next to me have small children and I can hear them running around the house and screaming a lot).\n\nI was out enjoying the warm weather when I started smelling cigarette smoke. Very potently. Our backyards are small, like 12x12 and the smoke just completely overtook the space. I went inside and didn’t think much of it. Later in the day I opened the living room windows and the room filled with cigarette smell. Nice. Thought maybe it was just a coincidence. But every single time I opened the windows or went out back from then on the neighbor was always out there smoking.\n\nI went out to tan once and the neighbor was out smoking. I decided to stay out there and just try to push through the smell because it would go away and then hopefully it would be a while before they were out again. Not 15 minutes later were they out smoking again. I decided to time how often they smoked, every 15-30 minutes on the dot. I started recording the date and time to send in to the HOA to see if there was anything they could do. Because at this point I can’t open my windows, I can’t enjoy my backyard, and I never see them out in the back unless it’s to smoke. Unfortunately the HOA pretty much said I’m shit out of luck.\n\nSo for the last year I haven’t been able to enjoy the space that I’m paying for because my neighbor smokes every 30 minutes. I’ve thought about going to talk to them or writing a letter to ask them to smoke out front. But I just don’t feel like it’s appropriate. It’s their house they can do what they want. I just wish I didn’t have to deal with the consequences of their decisions…my flowers died, I didn’t have any fruit, my fountain has dried up, my once beautiful zen sanctuary is now a deserted ghost town because my neighbor has to smoke every 30 fucking minutes.

What you have to do in order to survive is a whole other story. Maybe consider finding a way out of your community first and then remove the hijab after (or don’t, but it would be your choice). \n\nHilariously, if you look into the history of the hijab, it’s not actually a part of Islam. It was initially a Jewish custom that was later adopted by the wives of the prophet to distinguish themselves in society. After his death, more women started wearing it as a status symbol, and then it developed into a custom and eventually a method of oppression. Now, it’s wielded as an iconic part of a religion that never really required it. (And before the comments come for me, the only place a “hijab” is mentioned in the Quran is to say that when travellers come to the prophet’s household, they are to talk to them from behind a hijab - a curtain, not a headscarf. Otherwise, it just says everyone should be modest and cover their nudity).", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767993619.0, "id": "nyo5niy", "author": "farah1221"}

I do miss him, like I love the guy, we live together, we have a routine, we share groceries and stupid inside jokes. But the second the door closes and I hear his car pull away, my shoulders drop like Ive been holding my breath all week. It feels quiet in a way that makes my brain stop buzzing. And then the guilt hits so hard I feel sick.\n\nThe worst part is it’s not like he’s controlling or mean. He’s honestly pretty normal. He wants to talk after work, he wants to tell me about his day, he wants to watch a show together, he wants to cook and make it a whole couples thing. And I go along, because that’s what you do, right. But my job is remote and pretty intense, so by evening I’m already fried. When he’s home, I feel like I’m always being perceived. Like I cant just exist and scroll in silence without it meaning something. If I’m quiet he asks what’s wrong. If I say I’m tired he tries to fix it. If I want to be alone in the bedroom he thinks I’m mad. Even when he’s not doing anything wrong, my body acts like it’s on alert, trying to be the right version of me so we dont have a fight that never even started.\n\nWhen he’s gone I eat cereal for dinner, I watch trash TV, I fall asleep diagonally, I take a shower at 2am if I want. I don’t have to talk. I don’t have to translate my mood into words. I feel lighter, and that makes me feel like a monster. Because shouldn’t you want your partner around. Shouldn’t their presence be the comforting part. Instead I count the hours until he leaves and then I cry because what kind of girlfriend does that.\n\nI’ve tried telling myself it’s just introversion or stress or whatever, but it’s getting harder to ignore. I’m scared that this means I’m not cut out for living with anyone, or that I’m slowly checking out and I just havent admitted it yet. He’ll text me from the airport like “miss you already” and I’ll type it back, and I do mean it, but also I’m sitting there thinking about how quiet the apartment is going to be and feeling relieved.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "Girl. I want to grab you by the shoulders and say that this is *literally so fucking normal*. \n\nI've been with my partner for 8 years. I work from home, and I love when he's around, but oh my god I love it SO MUCH having my space for myself. I get just as \"feeling perceived\" as you do, cause well, you are. just because you love being around someone doesn't mean you have to love it all the time. it's perfectly normal to specifically enjoy the absence of a person that constantly interacts with you. not everyone feels like that, of course, but it's not a terrible thing if you do. \n\nAnd, most importantly, my boyfriend knows that. and feels it too! less than me, admittedly, but he does enjoy his alone time when I'm away for the night. We're clingy as shit and love to cuddle and spend time together, but I'd go insane if he was on my ass every single minute when he's home every day. as does he. we spent evenings completely separate sometimes, we say hello, I would like some alone time today, and that's it. there's a specific peace in not being perceived that you just don't have when someone's around, even your favorite person. \n\nwithout communication, it doesn't work though. I kinda get how your partner thinks something is wrong when you get silent, cause it sounds like you're putting up that whole show for him. it might very well be that he unwinds by talking to you, and doesn't know that you don't, but THINKS you do cause you do it without ever saying the opposite. \n\nit's perfectly natural to want space to yourself. in fact, it can be very healthy for a relationship. some people (most people) are just wired like that, we need moments to just ourselves, some more, some less. don't be ashamed about that, don't fall into the guilt spiral, and talk to him. It's no crime wanting to unwind alone sometimes, and if you tell him that you didn't dare to do that cause you were scared he'd misinterpret it as you not wanting to spend time with him, I'm sure he's gonna understand.\n\nnow, if he insists on it, thats a whole other problem. I'm assuming he's a decent guy, and as such he should care about what makes you comfortable in your own home. I'm sure he would never want you to put on this whole show of the lovingly clingy girlfriend if he knew it was a show. love doesn't need constant reassurance, it needs honest care, and that includes letting the other person unwind alone sometimes, and talking to each other about your needs.\n\nETA: and do not listen to people who say you have to break up, or that this is abnormal. you don't and it's not. relationships are never, ever that you have to want your person around all the time. it's trusting each other and yourself to be your own person, and be PARTNERS in life. that means giving each other space to be yourselves.\nand the breakup thing - just no. nothing in your post implies that you should. yeah, maybe your boyfriend is super clingy and incompatible and emotionally abusive, who the hell knows, but that's sure as shit not what your story implies. you just want a little space, and he doesn't get it (yet). do keep in mind that his reactions and how he chooses to talk to you are important information, but most likely? he's just oblivious. we can't know, and don't let yourself get scared into having to break up. take everything here always with a grain of salt, you know best how your relationship works. but do know that you deserve to have your space, and to feel comfortable when you do.", "score": 17, "created_utc": 1767894120.0, "id": "nyfpjkl", "author": "ImJacksLastBraincell"}

But our media isn’t reporting on it because that would remove the veneer of powerlessness they want us to feel. And some of our most basic rights aren’t being respected or followed. Constitutionally guaranteed rights are being straight up ignored. J6ers were a supremely small group, and they failed. Miserably. They didn’t succeed in their plot (and they’re being pardoned but that’s just an example of how our laws aren’t working for us). Our system is being raped right now, basically is the bottom line. I can’t even adequately verbalize how difficult it is for just an average American to even make basic ends meet, let alone manage to get out of work to protest. If I were in a big city, less brown, and physically able I’d 100% be protesting. And I think a lot of Americans would agree. If they fiscally and physically could (meaning location, not physical ability) they would. The Bonus Army didn’t have jobs. Hippies were actively counterculture already. A lot of Americans need to keep those jobs, especially in this economy and climate. Unfortunately, being a history buff, I see parallels to the past and I know you do too. Which is why I get the frustration and anger people have, I just want people to know what an average American faces that prevents them from physically protesting.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "After 30+ years of insanity I left my family and its feels almost magical", "text": "Hi I really wanted to scream and dance as hard as I can , but due to professional reason I can't do it our right , so here I am.\n\nFor some context I am younger brother to a person that I can only describe as well hidden psychopath, in a family that protects the image of the family more then its own collective parts. \n\nI've had multiple attempts on my life as a baby and as a child (i was about 6 the 2th time and about 8 and a half the for third attempt). All done by my older brother all three times caught and still nothing was done about it. Even worse somehow we both share responsibility because drum roll.... \"Brothers get a long\" (funny i can't remember having an argument as a baby but i digress). \n\nMy first memories were of my brother constantly berating me , damaging or outright destroying anything that was mine , all that in order to provoke a violent reaction, so he would be justified in beating to a pulp his diabetic brother who is also 3 years younger then him. When caught doing so ? \"Brothers get a long\" , you're both grounded , both harshly if I might add. If this was away from my parents I would be incline to agree , but over half of these \"cases\" were infront of their eyes. My older brother would not let me get a single moment of peace and if I snapped , well \"Brothers should get a long\" into grounded for X amount of months. \n\nWorst part was getting grounded. My only escape was going out , be it with friends , mates , hell even alone. Wanna guess our grounding was? X amount of months of staying at home , only leaving for school. This would go one until I was 16-17 I think. \n\nSo what happened ? Easy I just gave up. X gtfo of the computer , If i want it its mine. Fighting was pointless , so i just caved in. X I will use your only pair of shoes as work out shoes , while having 7 pairs. X your clothes look like shit , so i will just take them as gym / work out clothes as well. Imagine anything you posses , equals shit , which equals I can do what ever with it and if you speak out , well we're both gonna get it.\n\nNow you might ask but but what about your parents ? \n\nBoth my parents have only 2 things in mind. Family image and money. Don't believe me let me describe them to you in cases that are so far absurd not even people I know believe me that it happened. Two cases which by the way are FAAAR from their worst \"episodes\".\n\n1. My allowance / was a bout 0.50 euro , a single sandwich was about 1 euro and a bottle of water the same. Obviously with my 0.50 euro cents I can't by food or water at school , so? Well 1 day you save , the next one you eat or drink (but lets be honest it was always food).\n\nSo I decided that not being able to eat half of my school days was not a great way to live. So what can I do about it? Ask my folks? \"Why do you need more then 0.50 euro ???\" , Because food is like 1 euro , \"How dare you ??? You're obviously not thinking straight if think you need that much money\". \n\nSo instead of crying and getting grounded for X amount of months again i really hit the books. By my 2th year in highschool i had one a scholarship due to high academic achievement. Guess what was the reaction from my \"family\". My brother became extremely vindictive EVEN FOR HIM and my parents? Ha, no good job , no were are proud of you , nonono , \"Well now that you have a scholarship you won't be needing any money from us\". This meant IN TOTAL , no allowance , no money school supplies, books , clothes , i was expected to live on a scholarship money and cover my whole expenses on a scholarship from HIGHSCHOOL!\n\n2. fast forward 15 long years and both me and my brother in our early 30s. Brother wanted to start a business and took a loan. Business flatlined. Stuff happens , but here is the kicker , when he bought his apartment he took out a loan (2 lones now , 1 for business , 1 for his place). The builder jacked up the price but about 20K euro right at the end of the signing. He can't take a third loan because of his first two , so normally brother asks the family for help. \n\nGuess my folks reaction to this, please do.......... \n\nI get a phone call one day from father out of the blue (he calls only if money are related , not kidding , man wouldn't even wish you happy birthday if there was no money involved {NO I AM NOT KIDDING ABOUT THE Happy Birthday PART}.\n\nI pick up and even before I say \"Alo\" or \"Hello\" I get this scream : \" WHERE IS THE MONEEE?\"\n\nDad , dad , you're not making sense,  what are you talking about , what money?\n\n\"Your brother's first loan , WHERE IS THAT MONEY!!!?\"\n\nWhy are you asking me ? What do I have to do with my brother's money?\n\n\"Click\" call ended.\n\nIn the end they didn't even move a finger to help their first born psychopath and somehow I got blamed for his bad loan as well. Because you guessed it \"Brothers get a long\" , what on Gods green Earth does that have to do with his loan ? Who the fuck knows .\n\nSo these are my parents in a nutshell and for my brother , well since I moved out , he did realize that no \"Brothers don't getbi a long\" just because. What is strange that he has taken baby steps in mending our relationship (i didn't know we had one to be honest until he told me we do). For the most part it has been a resounding failure and today , today i finally did it.\n\nTODAY I FINALLY CLOSED THE DOOR ON THESE PEOPLE. \n\nNO SCREAMING , NO FIGHTS , NO BLAMES , NOTHING.\n\nTODAY IS THE DAY I'VE DREAMT FOR YEARS!\n\nTHE DAY I TOLD THEM: I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU PEOPLE AND I NEVER WILL. YOU WANT A HARMONIES FAMILY , WITH GRANDCHILDREN WHO WILL LOVE YOU? BEST I CAN DO IS NEVER TALK OR SEE YOU AGAIN. \n\nNOW LEAVE ME ALONE.\n\nI know it sounds pathetic , especially for a man in his early 30s , but I have FINALLY FUCKING DONE IT! This burden that could never go away is gone and i can't believe how insane it feels.

They both comforted her and asked if I will be ok (her father even invited me to his birthday , which was about 20ish days after our breakup).\n\nWhen I told my parents about us deciding to breakup.\n\nI am quoting from memory , but still it was just one simple sentence , so I couldn't be too far off:\n\n\"Good , now you can focus on saving more money\"\n\nThat was it , all of it. No how are you , how is she ? Is she ok , are you ok , did you end it on good or bad terms . NO , just money. When my ex told me about what her interaction with her parents I did cry a little (thankfully we were on the phone). So I lied , I told her how disturb my folks were of the news and asked if she was handling it ok. How can I tell her that my own parents did not GIVE A SINGLE FUCK ABOUT HER AND ME INCLUDED. I just couldn't and it broke me. \n\nWe human beings a quite the remarkable species , we've tamed deserts , tundras and to a degree even the seas. We can take as much punishment as possible before collapsing and rising up again tomorrow. Even so what cracked me was not my family's treatment , I was used to it by now , hell I even expected it even. What finally did it , was being exposed to so much raw humanity. Being loved and cared for was one thing when I was with my ex , but after that? What purposes did it serve? Why did they care ? \n\nSimple actually , good people , do good things because they feel like it should be done. I couldn't go back to pretend that I was related to these people any more. I just couldn't neither should any of you reading this. I know  how it sounds , but i feel alive now. I could barely hold my self in the office and now ? The feeling is incredible , feeling fearful and yet not truly scared , rather alive. Like the same way you feel alive climbing roller coaster getting ready for the drop. I don't know what the future hold , but it can't be worse then the past and the good part about the past is that I already paid for it , no need for seconds. And if somehow it gets worse , well atleast i'll always have \"the good old times\".\n\nSo if a spineless coward can do it after what feels an eternity, well you got this in the bag. Do not delay for ever , NO it won't get better , YES it will change over time .. for the worse and NO , NO amount of effort can do it , because it is not a one person job. \n\nPLEASE IF YOU MADE IT THIS LONG INTO THE COMMENT YOU'RE PROBABLY IN SAME BOUT.\n\nI KNOW ITS SCARY , BUT FEAR IS NOT THAT BAD , TRUST ME", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1767902750.0, "id": "nygmow7", "author": "Melodic_Literature80"}

Next day she gave me the hijab and said if l don’t put it on ill be homeless soon.

And I kept asking him what was going on and why he was going fast and he kept saying something about how it’s not working and then he would push me down again. Idk after it was all over I couldn’t really look him in the eyes and he seemed apologetic. I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Turns out my body doesn't like it when I eat meat. Problem is; I love meat.", "text": "This has been a recent discovery that I made courtesy of Billy Bob Thornton. (feel free to read everything in this post in his voice). He was describing symptoms he had growing up, where he basically ate everything but would feel like crap all the time after eating. He never really had the experience of feeling great after eating a meal. I was the exact same way.\n\nAnd then Billy explained how his doctor was telling him about different digestive enzymes, and that apparently, there's some evidence (although absolutely not confirmed) that when you have AB- type blood, you have weaker digestive enzymes. The solution Billy found was to avoid eating most meat and pretty much just stick to turkey and fish. I, similarly have type AB- blood. \n\nI've run an experiment over the last few days where I went full vegetarian and felt great. Then I had days where I would eat meat. After the meals with meat, I noticed that I felt like crap again. The food was sitting real heavy in my stomach. I'd have indigestion and everything. Not bueno!\n\nAnd unfortunately, the fat content of the meat seems to have a little bit to do with it, but not much. I seem to have problems with fish, chicken, beef; basically any kind of meat. The lower fat meats are definitely better though. The discomfort and sluggishness I feel after eating meat is bad enough that I'm just gonna swear off any meat I can buy at a grocery store. \n\nThank you, Billy for the knowledge.

Life hasn't been too bad to me lately - I'm doing well in school, prioritizing my fitness, and I'm genuinely excited to reach that milestone of my life.\n\nHowever, and this is largely due to me being in my feelings tonight because I've just moved back into my dorm, I can't help but feel a little... disappointed (?) at never experiencing teen love. People are going to say that it doesn't matter, and that it's actually a good thing I didn't experience it (or something along those lines), but it still weighs on my heart a little. \n\nEven though I'm still young in the grand scope of things, certain emotions and perceptions of mine are developing and maturing. Especially with the inevitability of having to worry about a full-time job and a house and a car and everything else that comes with adulthood, I have to come to terms with the fact that my life is changing, and with it, so do my notions of a lot of feelings that make up who I am. \n\nI think it would have been nice to experience juvenile love/adoration. I really hated high school, and even though it's probably played up by shows and movies, I can't help but wonder how the experience of teen love may have affected my adolescence; whether through developing a better understanding of how exactly people work (a skill I feel to be severely lacking in), or indirectly through, well, however those types of emotions can impact your character.\n\nI still struggle heavily with social interactions, much less those that are romantic. Even in college, I'm not well attuned to parties or any non-academic social scene, and while the teen love thing probably isn't directly to blame for this, I can't help but wonder if it was a symptom of other things that led to this social ineptitude, and if having experienced it would've alleviated some of the effects that I still feel today. Furthermore, it probably would've made talking to women (even platonically) much easier, which would make my life a lot easier.\n\nAnyways, I don't mean to wallow or feel too bad for myself - just a thought I was having. For anyone that actually read through all this, I really appreciate it.
