And I really want to allow myself to do this for myself tonight - I'm at a weight where I could even maybe allow myself to gain a little bit of weight (emphasis on little, lol). \n\nHowever, I'm so scared of losing the small amount of confidence I had today when looking in the mirror -- I genuinely feel and fear that eating one big meal, on top of my many snacks today, could singlehandedly change the way my body looks, in a way that could be visible tomorrow (and I mean more than just bloating, like my legs being thicker and my whole body being chubbier).\n\nThis fear is driving me insane. I struggle to go even a single day without counting my calories. On the VERY rare occasions that I do, I feel an immense guilt that's almost debilitating... Until the next morning comes and I see that the increase on the scale is not that significant. \n\nI just wish I could have, like, ONE day every 50 days where I could eat more. I know objectively that a single day of overeating, within reason, is almost impossible to cause a visible change (other than bloating). But I can't help but feel like if I go out and eat a pizza today, I'm going to LOOK different tomorrow.\n\nI don't know what my point is in saying all that.. I think I need reassurance that one or even two meals today can't ACTUALLY change the way I look.... right? Surely even if my weight increases it's mostly waterweight... idk guys, all these thoughts are becoming unbearable to me and i dont know what to do.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768048376.0, "id": "1q92xyh", "author": "Basic-Drawer8307", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1q92xyh/irrational_fear_that_my_body_will_change_after/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "Night sweats in recovery are common and have a physiological cause. When you start eating regularly after restriction, your metabolism increases rapidly. Your body is trying to repair tissue, restore hormone function, and rebuild energy stores, which requires significant energy and raises your metabolic rate. This increased metabolic activity generates more heat, especially at night when your body is working on repair processes. Your nervous system is also recalibrating because chronic restriction affects thermoregulation, and when food intake normalizes, your body temperature regulation needs time to adjust. Hormone fluctuations also contribute because recovery restarts thyroid function, sex hormones, and cortisol regulation, all of which affect body temperature. The sweating is your body's way of cooling down while it's working hard to restore itself. It's temporary and usually improves as your body adapts to regular nutrition and your metabolism stabilizes. The doctors told you it's normal because it is, even though it feels awful. You're not the only one. Many people in recovery experience this, but it's not talked about much because it's embarrassing. It gets better as your body adjusts to regular eating and your nervous system recalibrates, usually within a few weeks to months depending on how long you were restricting. Keep eating regularly, even when the night sweats are bad, because your body needs that nutrition to complete the repair process. Once your metabolism stabilizes and your hormones normalize, the sweating should decrease. If it persists beyond a few months or gets worse, mention it to your treatment team, but it's usually a normal part of the recovery process.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1767949422.0, "id": "nykdsb4", "author": "zakhere78"}

The thing is, he’s not a specialised therapist in ED (he knows some things but it’s not his specialty) , I don’t want to go somewhere else because we have a really good therapeutic alliance, but I don’t have the money to see two therapists at once. He told me to try and find some small things I could feel like doing to implement more food in my day to day life. I’m motivated but i don’t really know how to start. \n\nRight now, as i said, my state is not too bad. I have some \"rules\" that I follow for eating (like moments I’m allowed to eat) and I feel awful when I eventually break them. I know I feel better about breaking those rules when I can plan it out in advance (like I know I’ll go to a cafe with a friend two days ahead and I can mentally prepare to have a snack), when I eat alone (my therapist doesn’t like me indulging in it too much though as he’s worried I’ll stop going to social events if I have to eat there) but that’s about it. Doing things unexpectedly like my family deciding to go to a restaurant on a whim is very stressful for me, getting remarks from people (hence why I don’t like eating with them) is the worst. \n\nI don’t know how to work from there. No one in my life knows about my ED and I’m scared to talk about it because it’s not the first time I showed signs of disordered eating and having people (especially my family) knowing was the worst thing. They controlled my food intake even more than me, I got remarks… I’d rather not tell anyone. I thought about having one small snack in between lunch and dinner (as a routine I mean) but that’s the only idea I have. What small steps did you take towards recovery ? What worked for you ?

Aside from the financial aspect, which in and of itself is significant, it is often contradictory to be under 2 therapist/2 forms of treatment at once, so I understand wanting to stay with your current therapist, especially given the rapport you have built with him.\n\nIt can completely depend on the type of ED you are living with; I presented with bulimia, with some anorexic tendencies in the past, and it was startling to me how effective eating regularly was. I was so caught up in my rules; what foods I could and couldn't have, who I could eat in front of, what time to eat, how many calories etc etc, that I couldn't even see the vicious cycle I was in. As soon as I started eating regularly (3 meals and 3 snacks, no longer than 4 hours between each meal/snack point), the ED noise went down, the rules felt less suffocating, and social eating came with time.\n\nIt also may be beneficial to discuss the route of your ED with your therapist. He doesn't need to be a specialist in the field to explore this with you. Addressing the route of the ED and why it has continued to perpetuate can take time, but it might also be beneficial in the long run. \n\nI first addressed the day to day; I broke my rules, ate regularly (despite the discomfort), and actively did the opposite of what the ED told me to do. And then, when I was feeling clearer, began to target the core issue so the ED wouldn't keep appearing/perpetuating.

I am 20M and used to struggle with anorexia when I was 15-16. I'd been generally recovered, but have been thrown right back into it as of about a month ago.\n\nThis has happened because I started dating a man. I'm also a man, and have always been quite thin naturally, however I quickly realised that he is thinner than me (relevant). The nature of my disordered eating is much less about my own weight/diet, but instead is entirely based off being competitive. My entire motivation is about being thinner than/weighing less than/eating less than other people around me, specifically other males.\n\nThis is difficult to explain, but the severity of the situation lies in the fact that he is close to me, and also thinner than me, and he therefor repeatedly triggers me over and over just by simply existing in front of me. I do not get triggered by people I do not know, (e.g. online 'thinspo'), or by females, (e.g. a female friend who struggles with an eating disorder). Yes I know this is completely my own doing, and hold no blame or responsibility onto him whatsoever, I'm just trying to explain where the dysfunctional thoughts come from, as it feels different to the thoughts typically associated with eating disorders.\n\nMy first decision would be to decide to end things with this guy. The brutal truth is that if I ended things today, I'd be eating completely normally within a week or two (provided I don't form a relationship with another man again). However we've been seeing each other for 3 months now and are incredibly close. It's actually a really soppy 'love of my life' type situation, and I really really want to keep trying to make things work between us, even if it's directly causing me all of this suffering. I met him moving to University in September, and he's basically the only person I know as I've struggled making any friends. I am incredibly isolated, and really do not want to have to end things with him, even though that would be an immediate solution (albeit short-term), to my problems.\n\nI'm living by myself and responsible for my own meals for the first time, which makes my situation all the worse. I almost never leave the house except to see him or attend lessons. Because of the severity of my disordered eating, I'm also struggling immensely to engage with my course, and do well in it. I feel so alone and isolated, and am so scared for the next few weeks/months. He gives me all the support he can as I've explained a little of how I feel, but ultimately as long as he continues to look the way he does, I will continue to be triggered repeatedly.\n\nI have an appointment with the mental health practitioner at my local GP in a week. My current plan is to go back on antidepressants so I hopefully experience some relief from the obsessive and unrelenting thoughts about eating. If I can do that, I may find myself in a more able position to actually address the eating disorder.\n\nI have no idea what I aim to achieve with this post. I just feel so alone because of the way my disordered eating stems from this idea of being competitive, rather than from an actual desire to lose any weight. For the last month, the only thing I want to do is 'win' at this game of being 'skinny.' I will give up all of my friendships, family, my degree, and my mental/physical health, in order to 'win.'

For context, I have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember, so I don't know if it might be related to that.\n\nI often skip meals (breakfast, lunch, or simply won't eat anything between those big meals) to the point that I'll go 8 hours without eating anything, just because I cannot be bothered to eat. It feels time-consuming and unnecessary, even if I'm kinda hungry. In those days, I only realize that I haven't eaten in so long when I start to feel really dizzy and like I'm about to pass out. Because I'm so used to skipping meals, I will sometimes not even notice, and the thought of food won't even cross my mind. I really don't know why I do it, but a few years ago, I would do that sometimes (not as often as now) because I wanted a flatter stomach. Because I hate working out, it felt like a simple solution to that problem.

In fact, nowadays, I don't like my body too much because I feel a bit scrawny.\n\nOn the other hand (mostly a few years ago, but I'll still do it sometimes), I will eat more snacks than I should (cookies and sweets) when I'm anxious or rotting at home, feeling lonely or bored.

(TL;DR at the end)", "text": "**TL;DR at the end**\n\nHi everyone,\n\nI’m posting here because I’m trying to understand how to best help my partner in her current state, and I’m looking specifically for advice focused on *what actually helps someone with an eating disorder and severe depression*, not on how I personally cope.\n\nMy partner has bulimia and severe depression. She has described her mental state as living in a constant “fog” — feeling slow, disconnected, unable to think clearly, and struggling to process emotions or decisions. Some days even basic communication feels overwhelming or exhausting for her.\n\nFrom the outside, she appears mostly functional. She works, gets dressed, does her makeup, and can seem “okay” to others. She is not constantly in bed or visibly unwell, which makes the severity of her situation easy to miss.\n\nAt the moment, most of her energy is focused on simply surviving day to day. Because of this, our romantic relationship has moved into a second or even third plane in her life. We are officially a couple, but emotional availability, deeper conversations, and future-oriented topics are very difficult for her right now.\n\nI want to be very clear about the environment she lives in. This is **not simply a religion, but a high-control sect**. We are both Jehovah’s Witnesses, and we both live under that system. Leaving is not an option at this time. In addition, she lives in a very controlling family environment. Together, these factors severely limit her autonomy, privacy, and access to external support.\n\nShe tells me she wants to get better, but she is not openly seeking professional help — at least not that I know of. I also want to be fair and precise: **it is possible that she is trying to look for help or take steps privately without telling me**, because communication around these topics is very limited. When I try to talk about her mental health or recovery, it often becomes too heavy for her and she shuts down.\n\nAs a result, I am often emotionally kept out of her inner world and her day-to-day experience. This doesn’t feel like indifference, but rather a lack of capacity to explain, share, or involve me consistently.\n\nThere is also a serious safety background. I know that she wrote a suicide note **long before she met me**. This is not something recent, and I don’t believe she is in immediate crisis every day. However, knowing that this exists — and knowing the depth of her depression — is something that is always present in the back of my mind when trying to act responsibly. As far as I know, I am the only person who is aware of the full severity of her situation.\n\nI am trying to support her in ways that do not add pressure: keeping communication light, not demanding emotional availability, not pushing recovery timelines, and not forcing difficult conversations. However, I want to make sure that what I am doing is actually helpful and not unintentionally harmful or enabling.\n\n**What I am asking for is advice specifically about helping** ***her*****:**\n\n* What actually helps someone with bulimia and severe depression when they are mentally foggy and emotionally depleted, but still outwardly “functional”?\n* What partner behaviors tend to be supportive at this stage, and which ones tend to make things worse even if well-intended?\n* How can a partner offer stability and presence without increasing shame, pressure, or withdrawal?\n* In situations like this, what has realistically helped people move toward safety or professional support, even very slowly?\n\nI care deeply about her and want to act in ways that genuinely support her wellbeing, not just preserve the relationship or ease my own anxiety. Any insight from lived experience would be very appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nMy partner has bulimia and severe depression, lives in a high-control sect and family environment, and feels mentally foggy and depleted while still appearing functional.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "It’s so important for binge eating recovery to eat enough during the day. Otherwise your survival instincts take over and override you, and “willpower” won’t fix that. \n\nOne of the things I’ve learned is that if your rules are getting in the way of you losing weight (or being your healthiest self, to apply to the masses), then they’re bad rules and need to go. The best diet is one you can stick to, so it doesn’t really matter if you can go hungry all day  if you hit a certain breaking point.\n\nAnd that’s not because of a lack of willpower: it’s literally how your brain is wired. Your coping mechanism is chosen for you. You can’t choose which disorder you get. Anorexics for example don’t have “willpower,” they’re literally wired to do what they’re doing and you can’t do it because you aren’t wired that way. They often feel like they can’t pull themselves away from restricting the same way you can’t pull yourself away from binging.\n\nAnyway, I hope you are losing weight from a place of self care, kindness, and health, rather than self hate.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend Kiana Docherty’s video on YT, “The Ugly Truth About Self Criticism.”  It goes over the science of binge eating and self compassion vs self criticism.\n\nThe point: do what works, what you can stick to. Know yourself well. If you can’t stick to something, stop playing the losing game of trying to hate yourself into something you simply can’t do. If you’re hungry, for example, let yourself eat. If interested in weight loss, eat the right foods, high in volume and protein and fiber, but regardless, if you know you’ll binge when you let yourself go hungry, don’t do that.\n\nIt’s time to learn what really works for you instead of doing the same thing hoping for a different result. I wish I learned this sooner. Would’ve saved a lot of wasted time and self-hate.\n\nYou can’t underestimate how important being kind to yourself is during this process. Self hate will only drive the cycle.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767840515.0, "id": "nybs1lu", "author": "passionatedork"}

I'd stop and relapse for a long time and the constipation wouldn't go away. Ive finally been five years clean off of them and though I still struggle more than others with digestion and constipation, I feel like most of the damages have been reversed. So you will get better with time. In the mean time, stop taking them, and focus on your fiber intake, maybe even reduce caffeine intake. For a lot of people, caffeine can make going to the bathroom easier, and that was the case for me until I started taking laxatives, and healing from the damage I did. You should aim for twenty grams of fiber a day, but it can be more beneficial to get up to thirty if you're able to. Also with fiber, not the powdered processed shit from the store but from real food! Powdered fiber never did anything for me personally. Veggies, Berries, beans, nuts, seeds. All foods high in fiber.\nAlso my personal favorite combo for when I'm having extra trouble with digestion is steamed broccoli and a baked sweet potato. I call it natures laxative😆But try things and see what works for you.

I’ve been to a bunch of different therapists over the years and somehow was able to hide this for a really long time. I have recently realized some things and am attempting to begin recovery. It is so hard so far and I haven’t even done anything really. I met with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders which albeit was a huge step. I will be transferring care from my current general therapist to this clinic where I will do intensive work with a care team/with a therapist twice a week and a dietician once a week. I feel lucky to have found something that will be an alternative to residential/inpatient.\n\nThis comes with a few problems. They would like me to take myself to the ER (my partner would take me) to make sure I am medically stable. They don’t want to start any therapeutic treatment or dietitian work until I have been medically cleared. This is prompted by the fact that I have lots of chest symptoms and lots of dizziness for a long time. Essentially just labs and fluids etc. I don’t have to mention the ED.\n\nI am terrified to do that too. But I realize it is unavoidable. I have waited 2 days but would like to go after work today - I am a special ed teacher.\n\nUnfortunately this means that I will likely have to take off tomorrow. It also means that I will have to cancel an appointment tonight - I am scheduled with my original therapist, probably one of our last appointments before I switch. I don’t want to cancel last minute on him because I did that last week.\n\nI also don’t want to tell my parents. They were very hung ho in my adolescence and would make me uncomfortable in the ways they tried to support me. For example they took away my phone when they found out I was talking to my friends about my mental health issues and not them. Lots of reactive support in a way if that makes sense. I moved out of state to go to college and did not move back. I live with my partner of 5 years. I am on my parents insurance. I would rather tell them I am going to the hospital for dizziness and to not be concerned. I don’t like when they are concerned because they become undermining and misplace their support and project their fear. Fair, but not helpful. I also do the whole adulting thing really well and do not want them to come to my state 5 hours away and take all of that over and make feel like a child. I don’t know. This is so hard.\n\nI need advice and insight.

I was there 16wks and gained to a healthy BMI\n\nOver the last 10 years I've dipped my toes in and out of my ED. \n\nI was re-admitted to the outpatient program maybe around 25yo but didn't go and did my own partial recovery and things have been up and down since then\n\n\nThe problem is that I never told my GF about my eating disorder. I've even told her a bunch about being in a hospital outpatient program but I always said it was just for mood, not ED.\n\nCurrently my ED is in a really bad place, I am extremely underweight, and I'm going to be admitted to inpatient at the same hospital next week or the week after.\n\nI think today I need to tell her. I don't think she will judge me for my ED, but I do think she will be extremely hurt and upset that I kept it from her for our entire relationship. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips or advice about telling partners?\n\n(I hid a drinking problem from her for 1-2 months and when I told her she was very supportive, but she still feels hurt that I kept it from her but this is so much bigger)\n\nI am going to try to explain how not telling her comes a lot from my own denial that it is/ever even was a problem. As well as feeling so much shame and embarrassment about it and how the ED wants you to keep it hidden so you can get away with behaviors.\n\nI obviously fucked up by not telling her for so long and I am afraid she will never trust me again and that this will end our relationship but I need to tell her if I am going to go inpatient.  Even if I decide I won't do inpatient I need to tell her so I can work on recovery \n\nMy psychiatrist who I met at the hospital ED program and specializes in EDs said she would meet with me and her together next Thursday.

Never posted in any recovery communities before but I really need help… after deciding I didn’t want to continue the cycle, I spent the last 6 months forcing myself to gain weight and distancing myself from my restrictive habits. Over the last 6 months, I have gone from underweight to a healthy weight for my height/age/gender. I thought I was supposed to feel better once I was giving my brain energy to function and nourishing my body, I know it’s not THAT simple, but it was a lot of work just to gain the weight back. \n\nNow, I am having daily breakdowns over how I look. To be quite honest, I am disgusted with my body and I can’t stand it. I felt “too big” even when I was underweight, but now that I am actually bigger I feel so, so much worse. Walking past a mirror, getting a glimpse of myself in the shower, or putting on clothes sends me spiraling into a breakdown. I feel like every day is ruined because of this and I can’t get away from it. Every day I think “FINE, i’m just gonna starve again” but I know if I do, the cycle will just keep going and all the work towards weight gain would be for nothing. \n\nDoes anyone have tips for how I can accept my body mentally once I have gained weight back physically? Any advice for how to avoid the temptation to lose it all again? And any advice for getting past these daily breakdowns over my body? I am trying really hard to stay on the right path and I am so, so, SO tired of feeling like this.

Finding something to eat that I like is one of the main reasons I don’t eat, because I’m insanely picky and don’t like a lot of foods. Most my days my intake is 3 different supplements/vitamins I take and a Celsius and a lot of water, I don’t usually eat breakfast because I wake up super early for work and don’t have much time and that also means I sometimes forget to grab something for lunch and then when i get home there’s not much I like so I don’t really like to eat dinner so sometimes I’ll just snack on something but I understand that’s also not healthy. I also tend to track my weight in my notes app either weekly or daily and I understand it’s not healthy.

I am a happier person when I get to move my body. So I’ve started to get back into it. I’m going far less than I used to, but as soon as I resumed so did his constant ruminating about what he should be doing. Not because he wants to. But because it’s like the moral/ethical/correct thing he must do and he’s a lazy bum if he doesn’t.\n\nI tried to talk him down from doing a HIIT class because he hates it, the last one he did made him puke, and he wouldn’t be willing to eat the required calories to make up for this dramatic increase in movement (he hardly meets his meal plan as it is since graduating IOP in July 2025!). As a compromise I suggested trying a yoga class near me. It gives him the chance to move his body, do some meditation, and it’s low impact enough movement that I’m not worried about him overdoing it with exercise (he used to do a LOT of compensatory exercise and pretty much anything cardio seems like a slippery slope). But he said pretty much short of doing daily HIIT classes he will feel like a lazy bum.\n\nNot sure how much of this is ED vs OCD (the two are so intertwined) but I am scared that this sudden need for movement is driven out of anxiety/compulsion. He has ERP this week and his dietician next week. He will talk to both, but in the interim I would love some feedback on how you navigated getting back into exercise.\n\nHe was diagnosed July 2024 and did IOP July 2024-July 2025. During that time he was stopped from doing his obsessive stair climbing and walking and pushups (rightfully so), but his movement level can’t be zero forever. He thinks some exercise might be good for his mental health, and I don’t disagree.

It’s been about 10 months. My appetite came back in full force to the point where I couldn‘t resist eating the standard 3 meals a day. This had caused me to gain 30 pounds.

I know it may not make sense to some, but I feel weak that I don’t have the willpower to go back to m disordered eating ways.

Particularly because she has asked me to be her maid of honour, and make her wedding dress for her (I sew a lot, and this design that she wants is simple enough that its quite easy for me). In order to make the dress for her, I have to take her measurements. I was very open with her that I would need to do this to get it to fit right, and tried to accommodate by offering to make the dress very large and then take it in rather than measure her directly, as I felt that might be less triggering than sitting there putting a number to every part of her body (not that id say it aloud of course). She assured me that it's fine to take the measurements as it would use less fabric, and she feels more comfortable with me than someone else. But even so I'm very aware that this is a potentially triggering scenario, both the initial measurements, and subsequent fittings of the dress. Ive obviously read a lot about supporting friends, but most advice tends towards including them, and avoiding triggering words and scenarios, not much for such a specific situation and it feels kind of foreign to try on a wedding dress and not immediately gush about how beautiful someone looks. Does anyone have any advice on how to make this a positive experience for her? Or failing that, how to best support her in the scenario that it is difficult?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "Absolutely you both should talk to her but not in a combative way.  I have parented my own daughter through this dreadful illness, (it was easier because she was 14 and had to do what I said) and the longer it goes on, the worse it gets and the harder it is to recover.  Anorexia is an extremely serious illness and one that has a 20% death rate, mostly due to suicide, the highest of all mental illnesses.  I don’t say this to scare you but merely to encourage you to take action.  Because of her age, you are right, she has her own say over her medical decisions.  But that doesn’t mean you should just ignore it.  If she is cold all the time, lost periods she is in a very bad way.  Normal Bloods don’t show that she isn’t either as the doctor likely didn’t test for the right things anyway, but even still, someone can be severely malnourished and have perfectly normal bloods, my own daughter did.  Basically her body has turned down the furnace to conserve energy.  Her body is now focusing on keeping her alive, the blood pumping through her heart, her lungs inflating etc.  Reproductive health isn’t needed for survival so the period goes.  Anorexic patients often feel cold due to the body's physiological response to starvation and low body weight, which involves attempts to conserve energy and protect vital organs.  She will be battling inner voices from the ED (not in a literal sense) that she is still too fat, she isn’t sick enough, her family just want to make her fat etc etc.  So resistance is to be expected as ED patients don’t know they are sick, it’s called Anosognosia and is very common among ED patients.  Hence why intervention is most definitely recommended.  I won’t lie though, it’s bloody tough to manage with an adult who is living independently.  Maybe try to contact a support center who deals specifically with ED’s and seek some advice as to how to proceed.  It’s a highly specialized field of expertise though so only seek very specific help as many doctors and psychologists claim to have experience but most definitely do not.  Best of luck, it is clear you both care very deeply about your sister and she is going to need that support from you both to rid herself from the shackles of this awful condition.

It really took over my life when I was 20 years old, after I was SAed.\n\nI was anorexic for a few years but once I was intervened on by my family I reluctantly put on enough weight to satisfy them so they wouldn't send me to rehab but the ED didn't go away, it just changed into binging and purging/ bulimia for the rest of my 20s.\n\nI honestly think traveling alone when I was 29 helped me a lot. I would take myself out in public to restaurants and eat alone. Almost like these strangers were keeping me accountable. Another thing that helped was moving to a new city when I was 30 and having a relationship with my ex. At first being around him and sharing meals with him kept me accountable but then, after we broke up, I still kept myself accountable.\n\nI learned to cook. I would only cook for myself but suddenly I was making myself these beautiful meals and I enjoyed it like I never thought I could. I stopped prohibiting myself.\n\nFor a long time I thought I would never be as beautiful as I was when I was at my thinnest. I still associated thinness with the highest standard of beauty. I also still struggled to control myself around food, for me, when I was alone, it was always almost all or nothing but I slowly began trying to moderate, and not beat myself up if I slipped. A few steps back doesn't stop the entirety of the progress you've made.\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I moved again and had to live with roommates for the first time in 10 years which also kept me even more accountable. It didn't hurt that I moved to a country with AMAZING food that made me excited to go try new things. I even started writing reviews and taking pictures of my food and posting it.\n\nI met my partner around this time and he helped me (though he didn't know) eat even more regularly. He was the first person I ever cooked for, and cooked with and it became a beautiful activity for us. He inspired me to try working out again. For all of my life, exercise only existed to lose weight, or to punish myself after eating. I had several injuries, even broken bones from over exercising when I was anorexic and I was reluctant but I remembered how much I loved running and tried again.\n\nThis time I wasn't keeping track of my pace or distance, I was just running for fun, I could stop and walk if I wanted to, give myself a break. Just run for the beauty of it and for that feeling of freedom I remembered. \n\nI haven't owned a scale in 2 years but see how much I weigh at doctor's appointments. Before I used to weigh myself every morning and night and record it in a book where I also wrote down everything I ate. Throwing that book in the garbage along side my scale was a wonderful feeling.\n\nRecently I visited my mom and weighed myself out of curiosity and saw a had lost (a little bit) of weight. My first reaction was \"Oh man, I can't lose anymore or else my fancy bras won't fit\" and then a few moments later I just had this completely giddy moment...\n\nIt was the first time EVER in my whole life losing weight didn't excite me, didn't give me a rush or some satisfaction, in fact my immediate reaction was the opposite! I didn't want to lose anymore weight, I want my pretty bras to fit me!!!!\n\nI am eating more than I ever have since I was 18, am exercising and just feeling really healthy and strong and I just wanted to say to anyone struggling at the moment, it's possible.

I’m recovered from anorexia and have experienced how horrible eating disorders can be to someone, especially when it’s been happening for multiple years. My girlfriend hates talking about it and tries to avoid the subject at all costs because she says she doesn’t feel like she looks like she has an ed and thinks it’s embarrassing to admit and doesn’t want to worry me. She lies about when she has thrown up, when she’s eaten, etc. Recently, she’s been getting much worse. She has been telling me that she really does think she’s getting better, and that she hasn’t thrown up for a few days, but this morning she told me that she had actually been throwing up at least twice a day for a while now. Her nose has also frequently started bleeding after throwing up. I’m really worried about her, but it seems like any support I try to provide does nothing and it just feels like she’s getting worse and worse. I’ve contacted her parents about it because she still lives at home, and they have done NOTHING to try and stop it. After a few months of convincing, she finally made an appointment to see an eating disorder therapist, but I want to provide her additional support outside of that. Any tips on how I can help her and get her to talk to me?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767566595.0, "id": "1q441yn", "author": "Livid_Procedure_6883", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1q441yn/how_to_help_someone_with_bulimia/"}

I have never had problems with compulsive exercise. \n\nA big problem is every night my parents choose a large pudding for me  often double a normal person's (ie 2 magnum ice creams) often  I will crave something, they then give me something completely different. I then feel I can't eat this thing as I've already had something big not long beforehand. \n\nI know this is not recovery. Maybe it is quasi, or harm reduction, I don't know.

I just don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this irl and thought you guys might find it hopeful/useful.\n\nI was bulimic from the age of 16-24 and gave myself permanent lifelong stomach damage because of it. More specifically: almost daily inflammation, had to remove my gallbladder, and food basically digests more slowly through me. I probably have the digestion of a senior citizen and I’m only 32.\n\nUp until I went on meds for ADHD, I tried probably hundreds of diets, my weight fluctuated massively throughout the years, and nothing ever stuck. I had a legitimate compulsion whenever I was upset or needed comfort to just grab something to eat or drink even if I wasn’t hungry.\n\nFast forward to three weeks ago: I started on meds intended for people with addictions (like smoking) that also helps people with depression and ADHD. This was mainly to treat other issues in my life but as a “btw”, my doctor told me the benefits are that people tend to lose weight on these meds.\n\nDidn’t really think too much of it because like I said, nothing has ever worked for me. I always inevitably go back to overeating.\n\nWithin days of starting these meds, that part of my brain has completely switched off. I’ve tested it numerous times by thinking of yummy food, or when I’m feeling even slightly upset, thinking of making my favorite coffee drink, but nothing seems appetizing or appealing to me anymore.\n\nThe meds I’m on are meant to help treat people with dopamine deficiencies. I feel happier, I wake up with energy, my mind is more clear than it’s ever been, and best of all I don’t have a toxic relationship with food. If I’m hungry, I eat, but I almost never finish my plate anymore and I NEVER snack. \n\nThat was completely unheard of for me before. I was a huge snacker and had to have certain snacks at certain times (maybe a bit OCD-like), but now I never buy snacks anymore. I just don’t crave it.\n\nFor alcohol too: I never drink, but when I do, I tend to keep drinking/overdo it. The last time I drank which was about a week ago, I only drank half of a beer and was done. It was crazy lol.\n\nHopefully this helps someone feeling trapped like I did. It’s very possible you have a deficiency in your brain like I did that compels you to use food as comfort. I would bring it up to your doctor!\n\nAnd for anyone curious: the meds I’m on are Bupropion XL.

After almost 20-years of living with anorexia (31F, restrictive purge type), I have finally found some motivation to get better and go to treatment with transparency and honesty. \n\nWhen completing residential in the past, I avoided weight gain by working around the system. I know that life without an ED is apparently better, but I don’t have any memories of it. All I know is that when I lost weight almost 20 years ago, life got better. People were nicer, and doors opened for me that allowed me to leave the trauma in the past and move forward with my life. I am successful at work, married, and able to function in daily life. However, the ED is a constant presence and at times it feels like the ED is me. Providers have given me coping skills, and I haven’t been able to effectively use them to overcome my fear of weight restoration. If given the choice, I sometimes think I would rather die than gain weight. \n\nMy perspective changed when I saw my husband breakdown over the holidays. He’s worried for my health, and I realized how much I am hurting him and myself. I spoke with my provider and told them I think I will need another residential stay to gain weight.\n\nI’m now faced with a decision around where to go. I’m seeking recommendations / advice from others who found recovery after a longstanding ED requiring weight restoration. Where did you go that helped you? What did you do to overcome the weight restoration fears? It still feels impossible, and I don’t know if I’m even capable - but I would like to try.

I've never been surrounded by friends, but now I have like, almost none.

I have an online friend but recently he snapped at me and hurt my feelings pretty bad and I don't think things will ever go back to the way they were before, so I think I'm pretty much alone at this point. My boyfriend and my sister are literally my only friends and I even have to text my sister first and my boyfriend doesn't talk to me as much as I'd want him to but it's because he is extremely extremely introverted and quiet.\nI still work part time as I'm coming out of college while looking for a full time job which is difficult these days. I've had no success so far. That means I mostly spend my days alone, in my room, and it kills me. Cuz of long distance my boyfriend and I only see each other on Saturdays and every time I have to leave to go back home, my heart shatters. I cry every time. We are working towards living together but that's still a work in progress.\nI hate being alone so much. I asked my boyfriend how is he so okay with being alone in his room and he said he sees it as more of a time off from others than being alone, but I have never in my life needed time off from people, and I have never ever had the thought of \"I want to be alone now\". \nAny hobby I try to do just reminds me of how alone I am and I don't really have much interest in literally anything. Most of the time I spend on my phone, trying to forget I'm alone. Scrolling makes the time go by a bit faster.\nI cry all the time. I was on vacation with my boyfriend for 3 days and when I came home yesterday I cried all night because of how much I miss him and how much I don't wanna be alone right now.\nI lived alone for a year but I moved back in with my parents because I was quite literally going crazy. I had constant panic attacks for some reason mostly around food and fear of being allergic for some reason and had to work really hard to get rid of them, sometimes they creep up anyways.\nCuz of all that I fill the void with food, and I have no energy all the time. I can't really distinguish between being hungry or just being bored/alone anymore. \nI don't want to be like this anymore but I don't know what to do to stop. I just don't wanna live like this anymore. I don't wanna hurt all the time. I know it's not normal and I know it's unhealthy. Please anything, any advice or support or suggestions or anything would be appreciated.\nThank you anyone that read this for your time.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767445028.0, "id": "1q2tzgo", "author": "notheragain123456", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1q2tzgo/i_over_eat_cuz_i_need_to_fill_the_void/"}

I wouldn’t call the state I am in currently “recovery,” more like I am hiding in the middle of a battlefield with soldiers fighting all around me, and I am too scared to move in any direction because I will undoubtedly be hurt and it will be my fault for walking right into everything. \n\nI was in three different residential programs two years ago.  Every single one of them was worse than the last.  I was not treated like a middle-aged woman struggling with an eating disorder.  I was treated like I was a naughty child who wasn’t capable of managing her own life.  Each program was more restrictive than the last - being locked INSIDE rooms was very traumatic for me.  There was literally no way out, no place I could go to turn off.  It was constant overstimulation, noise and chaos.  Arbitrary rules based on who was working.  I understand there are things in place for safety - but we shouldn’t be treated like we are criminals because we asked for help.  \n\nI felt like a wild animal lashing out for self-preservation.  My husband still makes fun of me for kicking at the locked door in a moment of being terrified I was never going to get to leave.  I still don’t find it funny.  I was alone, I was terrified and I was at the THIRD place that promised they could help me.\n\nI don’t want to ever discourage anyone from getting treatment at any place.  If I had been at those places as a teen or college age, I wouldn’t have been so far from being a grown woman who is married, owns her own home and car, and has a job - a life.  When I was younger treatment almost seemed, well, not a summer camp, but it was a very different experience and I saw life from a completely different and immature point of view.  I don’t mean I am the master of maturity and wisdom now, but you do gather wisdom from life experiences each year you have been alive.  So having a twenty-something person hiding your mail because she thought you got too much of it, literally playing out a twenty year old trauma.     \n\n\n(short version - dad’s girlfriend hid letters my mom sent me for months-nothing was done about it and she was extra rude and mean to me based on things my mom wrote that I never read.  No idea why she did that - if she had asked to read them I probably would have let her bc I was always trying to make her like me.)\n\nThis person in a treatment center, in position of power over me, was replaying the worst time of my life (obviously there was more to the story) treating me very similarly for no reason was just a special level of “why the fuck am I even here?” And “I give up, this is obviously not going to work.”\n\nI wish there was a program for middle-aged and older women.  We are in completely different stages of life and are facing different challenges.  Ever had to deal with hot flashes in treatment?  I wasn’t even allowed to have a cold pack…because reasons.  Staff had a huge fight over whether or not I could keep my hemorrhoid cream in my stuff locked in the bathroom or if the nurse needed to have it locked in the area with medication.  Like really?  How the fuck is any of this supposed to help me or trust you know what you are doing.\n\nAnd all of that sort of sums up where I am at.  I went into treatment with good intentions, but left traumatized and dejected.  All for thousands of dollars.\n\nETA:  I relate so much to the way woman are cow-towed into diets and weight loss.  If I had a dime for every asshole who said “perimenopause doesn’t cause weight gain, you are just eating too much, I would have enough money to be bailed out after losing my shit.\n\nOzempic is always a topic.  Get in your steps, watch your cholesterol levels.  You can’t eat like you did when you were younger.  Wow, you are a size X now??  \n\nLike, leave me the fuck alone.  Am I supposed to gain weight or lose it?  If I gain weight am I going to hear about how I “let myself go?”\n\nI wish everyone the best in their recovery.

Ive tried recovery but when i gained weight,it went to all the wrong places, it went to my stomach,thighs and upper arms and my face looked very puffy, but not at all where i actually wanted it(my boobs or ass) ,which led me to just relapse and lose it all and more again. \n\nI thought when i became so thin, id be pretty and be more likeable and id be happy and that it would solve all my problems and thought i was in control and powerful and better than others, but it did the opposite. I hate m​y​ body, i hate how flat i am because i look like a bony door, im MISERABLE to the point where i hate life and had many thoughts of ending it because it feels like the only way of escaping it, no clothes fit me right, ive discovered that im in fact not in control AT ALL and it just controls me now, im not likeable at all because it turned me into a fatphobic cunt​​ and it made me a horrible person and its ruined many relationships because i yell and argue and throw tantrums whenever people would look out for me and tried to help or anything, talking to me was the equivalent of talking to a brick wall with how stubborn anorexia made me and people can only deal with that sort of behavior for so long before they leave and move away from you, not to mention id lie CONSTANTLY. Ive also ruined my health. These past two years have been torture and i thought i was in control but im not. \n\n I WANT TO RECOVER but im scared because my brain keeps telling me im not sick enough and i need to lose more weight and also i will feel like ive ruined these years of my life for nothing and also im scared of what i will look like if i gain weight because in the past, i looked chubby but was still very flat. Also i feel like people have gotten used to me just looking like that so changing and gaining weight would be very strange.

My sibling lost a lot of weight a few years ago by counting calories, even though they were never at a high weight. They are currently maintaining their weight (I think), but from what I can see, they seem extremely unhealthy. They are very very thin like they look like people who are hospitalized. They are a three season athlete (cross country, indoor track, and track and field). They don’t eat breakfast, I don’t see them at lunch so idk, and at dinner they eat laughably tiny portions. When I went on vacation with them, they ate like half as much as everyone else did (and the rest of us arent like fat, we just eat normal portions). Ive also seen them hide food. Im not sure how they are still functioning. My parents are aware of their eating habits and have made it clear that they believe that they are unwell. However, my sibling denies it. My parents have gotten labs, which came back fine other than iron deficiency. My sibling seems not to have lost weight in a year, though I do understand that one can find ways to make the scale read a number without necessarily having that much body weight.  Because they won’t admit to being unwell and they are medically stable, not much can be done (according to our parents). I also understand that their (closeted) nonbinary experience may be part of it. They don’t get periods anymore and their breasts are much smaller, so I could understand that this might be part of the motivation for them to eat less. Overall I feel quite hopeless. They are going to college soon, and I am terrified that they will die soon if they can’t start eating more. Is there anything that I can do as a sister to be supportive? Also, how do I cope in my own recovery while around someone like them who is severely underweight, unwell, and not getting better?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "title": "Relationship between eating disorder/recovery and libido?", "text": "So I developed orthorexia in 2022 (in response to chronic health issues) which lead to 7 months of period loss at its worst. During that time I had absolutely zero libido, to the point where I was totally repulsed by the idea of sex and couldn’t comprehend why anyone would want to have it (very much not my usual state!)\n\nAt the beginning of 2023 my period returned but I was definitely still in recovery that year and gradually increasing my food intake. IIRC, my libido somewhat returned but was probably relatively low/on the low end of normal for me during this time.\n\nThe latter half of 2023 I was able to greatly increase calories (I hope this is okay to mention? Know we’re not allowed to include numbers). By early 2024 my libido fully came back to normal.\n\nAt the beginning of 2025 my libido was sky high and it felt like I was experiencing a sexual awakening. However, it started to lower and has now tanked.\n\nTwo things occurred before it began to decrease: one, I increased a medication I was taking which very clearly messed up my hormones.\n\nTwo, I was unfortunately diagnosed with genetically high cholesterol and had to halve my fat intake, which has of course meant a very noticeable decrease in calories.\n\nThe amount I’ve been eating since isn’t terrible, but it’s a lot less than I would ideally be eating. It took eating a significantly higher calorie intake than this for about 8 months back in ‘23/‘24 for my libido to fully recover (and I continued to eat around that much after). \n\nMy libido now isn’t at that zero, sex-repulsed place it was when I lost my period, but it is very low.\n\nAt first I thought the drop in libido was purely medication-related (I won’t go into the hows, but I know it’s at least partially related and have been off the meds a month), but it recently occurred to me that the significant drop in calories, esp at a time when I feel like on a biological level my body might still be recovering from that period of starvation/malnutrition, could be playing a part too.\n\nI suppose I didn’t consider it bc weight-wise I think I look fine, I don’t feel hungry, and I still have my period, and I’d been feeling normal for a year by the time I had to lower my calorie intake.\n\nBut is it possible that significantly decreasing my calorie intake a couple years into recovery, and a year after my libido fully returned/hormones went back to normal, could be affecting my hormones and tanking my libido again?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767312136.0, "id": "1q1jc9i", "author": "moon_peach__", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1q1jc9i/relationship_between_eating_disorderrecovery_and/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "Yep, I've been with you so many times throughout my 25 years of life. \n\nFood is my ultimate 'basal' cure all, it's there for me when nobody else is and it makes me feel genuine comfort, joy and something even close to love. It numbs my pain and gives me satisfaction when I'm bored. \n\nBy 'basal' I mean that there is something so primal about it, whereas things like being creative or working on hobbies or socialising are products of our evolved brain which do usually make us happy, they're far more complex than simply finding some good food to eat. I enjoy my brain shutting off, giving me some space and losing myself in the practically reptilian act of seeking food, eating food and drifting off to sleep. Simplicity itself.\n\nI was with you for so long, feeling so lost and so helpless because it seemed like everyone else could say no - while I gained weight I internalised society's opinions telling me \"just eat less and move more\", \"it's not that complicated\" and \"if these people can do it, why can't you?\". \n\nBut the truth is that once I examined what exactly food does for me, without guilt or shame, without putting myself down for being so 'weak' and beating myself up for 'failing' something that other people could do so effortlessly, I realised that for me food is a powerful coping mechanism that helped me through the toughest times. Once I accepted and saw how much value I placed in it, I realised that it's no wonder I chose it everytime. And once I started showing myself some compassion I started focusing on my weight and body less, because yes I am big and that is because I've lived MY life, not anyone else's. \n\nIt hasn't been easy at all, I went through a lot of fucking pain and loneliness and torment and no one gets to tell me that food is so simple to put down and that losing weight is just calories in and calories out. Because no, it isn't. To change you gotta give yourself the strength to fight your demons and heal. You have to learn to struggle against the tide of thoughts that say you're worthless and weak and lazy and have no willpower and say no, you're actually strong for just existing and surviving. You're still standing despite all the pain and mindlessly eating has been your best friend for so long that you feel like you can't say goodbye, you can't live a life without them because all the pain, fear and sadness will creep back in. That is a harder process than most well adjusted \"normal\" people can ever imagine. \n\nI'm sorry that you feel so hopeless right now, nobody deserves to feel that way. My thoughts are with you, please look after yourself and try to be kind to the person who needs it most - even if you think you don't deserve it. \n\nP.s. Another thing that really helped me is the right antidepressant. I got on one about 4 months ago that doesn't make me hungrier (some do which suck), and helps me do things other than eat to manage my emotions. I am recovering, definitely not eating as much as I used to, and may not look quite how I want but getting more exercise and feel generally more okay being in my body. \n\nThere is hope, for me, you and everyone even if it really doesn't feel like it right now. May it reach you soon. &lt;3", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767519123.0, "id": "nxll78c", "author": "whatever_6778"}

I would recommend not counting the calories of your food intake at all and trying to be kind to yourself. Discipline or strong words or tough love aren't going to work.\n\nBingeing is fuelled by restriction and it originates either from restriction itself or from a deeper unmet need.\n\nEating consistently matters just as much with bingeing as with other EDs, so make sure you're having three meals and two snacks, or work towards something as close to that as possible. In time, this can help reduce the frequency of binges.\n\nBecome a scientist of yourself: how do you feel while you're bingeing, after, right before? Are there common denominators across your binges? By asking these questions you may uncover which unmet need your binges are trying to help you cope with.\n\nRemember, this is a coping mechanism. As much as you might not like it, as much as it isn't ideal, it's better than the alternative of having extremely tough feelings you can't deal with at all.\n\nNo calorie counting, be kind to yourself, eat consistently and be curious.

Hunger is built on patterns and what your stomach expects as much as anything else. You have to be able to use your brain to be smarter than your hunger at least occasionally. It's not just about eating too much either - when I first started ADHD meds I also only ate when I was hungry and went from clinically obese to underweight in 6 months.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767214102.0, "id": "nwz4q64", "author": "freddythepole19"}

During the first session as people were doing introductions it became apparent that every person there has Autism, ADHD or both. The therapists explained one of the theories that ADHD springs from the hunter gatherer instinct not being switched off and as a result some people with ADHD who have had certain experiences are constantly on the hunt for food.\n\nAnyway, it has been drilled into us in group that by far the best way to start getting things under control in three meals and three snacks three hours apart. The idea is to teach your body how to recognise hunger, thirst etc and make you far less prone to emotional or autopilot binges. \n\nIntuitive doesnt work as i don't feel hungry most of the time but if i do it becomes an overwhelming binge, especially with the inpuse control issues of adhd.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767218719.0, "id": "nwzit0v", "author": "Ragnarsdad1"}

But I have always been an overeater and therefore overweight. I have gotten to the stage where i am very neurtal about my body and am focussing on body neutrality. I care more about nutriens and not overreating in fat or sugar, and find calorie counting interesting, but i dont do it everyday. I dont do it at all now actually. \n\nBut lately, i have been apathetic towards food. When thinking about having to sit down for a meal, i get annoyed and just dont do it. I dont mind more unhealthy foods and eat whatever i can find when i do have to eat, but I dont see it as important anymore. \n\nI dont care for food or anything, and find the need to go have breakfast, lunch and dinner and snacks mind numbingly exhausting and it feels like constant nagging. Even thinking about doing it feels as though someone is stabbing my brain with a knife. It is nothing like before where i restricted or didnt allow myself to eat \"unhealthy\" foods, i simply do not care for it at all. Something in me tells that this can become disordered very quick, but another part of me thinks this is just normal and regular. I like the idea of going to a restaurant one of these days and trying new foods, but if i could, i just wouldnt. I dont want to lose weight perse or starve because i know it is terrible for my organs and brain and skin and basically everything. But that also does not motivate me top go and eat. \n\n  \nI dont know, maybe it is because life is filled with stress and i have gotten overwhelmed a lot lately, to the point where the smallest bit of critique, worry about my school performens or just friendships have felt like hell and I dont want to deal with any of it anymore. \n\nI do have a therapist and am very much for mental health help and getting better, but I find the fact that I do not see this as much of a problem as the main problem.

That’s when comments about my body (mostly from family) started to affect me, and I began trying to lose weight.\nAt first, it was exercise and “healthy habits,” but eventually I learned about calorie tracking, and that’s when my relationship with food really started to deteriorate. At home, meals were very rigid: we had to finish everything on our plates, even if it felt like too much. When I started tracking calories, I became extremely anxious because I couldn’t accurately measure what I was eating, especially home-cooked meals.\nRice became the biggest trigger.\nBecause rice was hard to track and always present, I started skipping meals and restricting to compensate. Over time, I began saying I hated rice and that it made me feel sick. At first it was a way to avoid eating it, but eventually I truly believed it. Rice went from being one of my favorite foods to something that felt physically and mentally unbearable.\nEven now, I still can’t eat plain rice, and I still feel like it makes me sick, even though I know that reaction likely comes from fear and conditioning rather than the food itself.\nWhat makes this especially painful is that rice was something I shared with my dad and my grandpa. It was “our” food. Now my dad eats rice alone, and I really miss being able to enjoy it with him.\nSo my question is:\nIs it possible to relearn how to enjoy a food after years of restriction and mental conditioning?\nHas anyone here been able to make a feared or avoided food feel neutral, or even comforting, again?", "score": 2, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1767144038.0, "id": "1pzzsqr", "author": "Away-Poem-5671", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1pzzsqr/can_you_relearn_to_enjoy_a_food_you_trained/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "super long reply incoming oops. Let me know if you have any questions about what I said. Apologies for the long read.\n\nTo your question, absolutely!! In my experience, thoughts can be crucial shifters of what you believe over time; so use them as a spearhead. In the same way you developed the fear, you can unravel it. Our brains have plasticity, so we have the power to rewire some crap perspectives up there. I have been able to enjoy fear foods again! You are not stuck here.\n\nThinking new thoughts was the biggest game-changer for me when it came to dethroning negative identities I used to hold onto and suffer over. It's going to be like filling an old rut in your brain and digging a new one. Don't expect it to happen overnight; be patient and gentle with yourself in the process. You're one of 8.3 billion other people in the world grappling with some form of fear.\n\nThe goal is to come against those fearful thoughts with the truth when they arise. Stop agreeing with it. Let's say you have the thought, \"I hate rice,\" your response could be, \"That's a lie. I love rice. It makes me feel closer to my family.\" Disagree with the lie, then tell yourself the truth.\n\nIf you want to give this a try: Decide your reply, and then be as consistent with it as you can. A little goes a long way, though!! So you do not have to do it perfectly. I was actually surprised when I noticed my thoughts start to change automatically, given how much of a tug-of-war it was at first to resist the thoughts I was used to thinking. Sometimes, a clear thought may not emerge; you might just FEEL fear/discomfort when you look at rice. Respond to that feeling with the reframed thought as well. I find that saying it out loud is even better if you're in a place where you feel comfortable doing it.\n\nAn example from my life: Every time I remembered an awkward interaction I had, I would automatically say \"I hate you\" to myself. I didn't realize that I was affirming a web of disempowerment inside of me every time I did this. Hm, constant complaint against self, zero grace or compassion towards self, left unchallenged since childhood... in hindsight, OF COURSE it would contribute to the depression and maladaptive methods of coping in my life. I escaped my thoughts; I did not challenge them. I do not blame myself; this was the only way I knew to survive. Until I started to reply to \"I hate you\" with \"I don't hate you. I love you, (my name).\"\n\nAnd honestly, I wanted to quit immediately because nothing felt different immediately, and the rebuttal felt pathetic, and it was more comforting to indulge familiar misery. But I kept up this rebuttal, and over time, I noticed that the automatic thought in my head as I recalled an embarrassing moment was \"I love you.\" As that thought grew more automatic, the attached feeling of self-hatred did not change with it right away. A bit more time passes, and a feeling of relief and/or peace now accompanies those moments of recollection. It's one step at a time, one thought at a time.\n\nIn other words, you do not have to *feel* like it is true for the correction to be working. It's like the way that you don't see a broken bone healing underneath a cast... you trust that with the right correction in place, it'll get there... fully restored. You do not need to rush yourself. Some beliefs will change quickly, and others might need a few months.  \nI'm hoping my reply is not too overwhelming. I wanted to be thorough. But the practice in reality is simple, and little by little. In the meantime, let the rest of your life take up space.\n\nGod bless you!

It destroyed my metabolism. \n\nI never \"looked\" anorexic, but there were times when I would go literally days without eating. When I finally sought treatment, I was significantly overweight.

In treatment, I met a woman a few years younger than me who learned that she had irreversible damage to her heart muscle caused by her anorexia. Had she sought treatment just a few years earlier, it could have been avoided. \n\nI'd like to (gently) suggest that you're not worried that you're not \"skinny enough\" for treatment, but that you're afraid to go to treatment. Eating disorders are all-consuming. They become our personality and our identity. It's scary to think that treatment might take that \"part\" of us away. That part is a liar, though. You are SO much more that your eating disorder. I bet you are sweet and funny and smart and a whole bunch of other things. You are more than anorexia. You can find those parts of yourseld again in treatment. There's no such thing as \"not sick enough,\" especially if you've been offered a spot.

Anorexia is a horrible disease, yes. But so are all eating disorders. Except anorexia is one that everyone can see (if not atypical anorexia) and takes seriously. Many other EDs suffer in silence. And I experienced that. “You don’t look like you have an ED.” “You look so healthy.” “You aren’t thin enough to be starving yourself.” \n\nThis brought a great deal of comfort to me: you quite literally can’t choose which disorder you suffer with. You can’t force yourself to be anorexic because you aren’t WIRED that way. Having had both, my mindset and coping skills were completely different. And there are docum eyes differences in the brain of neurotransmitters in AN vs BN vs BED. \n\nThink of it like this: an eating disorder is a loss of control over one’s behavior. Whatever disorder you have is the thing you can’t stop doing. So for anorexics, their coping skill is restricting, and they feel as though they can’t stop restricting. And they didn’t choose that, their brain is wired that way. Vs for someone else who can’t stop binging, and wishes they could restrict, it’s just a different disorder. \n\nAnd if you want to do that to yourself, I promise you ARE sick. No one healthy wants to hurt them elves that way. If you WANT to have anorexia, you might not have anorexia, but you DO have an eating disorder, and you are very sick with it.

But if you’re going all out when you do drink or if it’s more than once in a while, I can’t emphasize enough how actively drinking undermines your ed recovery. And, for a lot of people, it becomes a replacement for the ed behaviors. Up to 30-50% of people with ed have a co occurring substance use disorder.

I first saw a clinical psychologist in 2022 for my restrictive eating habits (i ate very little and exercised compulsively, but i was never clinically underweight), and therapy didn't help. To be fair, i didn't want to change at that time because I was afraid of gaining weight/losing control. In the summer of 2024 (after speaking to both my school and college counsellors), I sought help from another clinical psychologist, but it was still not helping. Eventually, when all my symptoms became worse, I saw a psychiatrist. After taking medications with therapy for 1.5 years, i stopped both because instead of getting better, I got only worse. I became what I feared the most. I started binge eating, and the episodes became more and more frequent. This year, I saw another psychiatrist, and after trying a few medicines, I found a medication that actually worked (bupropion). I lost my appetite and completely stopped binging. But even when I saw it as progress, I was restricting myself a little too much. And then I had a seizure (unfortunately) and had to stop all psychiatric medications. My symptoms flared again, and I started binging. And then after a month I started taking an SNRI and started dieting again. I was feeling happy and in control, but I lost control today and binged. In the last 5 years, I have never eaten like a normal person. I hate therapy. I am a psychology student, and I still find therapy to be useless (at least for me). I keep oscillating between the extremes, and in the last year, my binge episodes have become very frequent, leading me to gain a significant amount of weight, which makes me very, very uncomfortable.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "hii I went through something similar. I had the exact same thing where I went on a \"health journey\" lost weight, exercised, etc. Before I knew it though I spiraled so deep into calorie counting and exercise that I gave myself a pretty nasty ED. Then, when my finals/midterms rolled around, I guess I realized my grades mattered WAY more to me than my body and I just stopped. Before I knew it, I had broken a dam and I just ate everything and everything. I ended up bingeing for like a month and ironically gained back most of the weight I lost lol. I'm still in the woods a bit, but the best advice I can give is to just let it happen.  \n  \n A lot of what you are experiencing is your body trying to protect itself from a period of severe restriction so it is stocking up on any energy it can find. The WORST thing to do (trust me!!!) is to try restricting again. Everyone likes to think that they are different and that they really can white knuckle their way through it. The reality though is that, not to be mean, you are probably not. It's just physiology. You deprived your body for so long that it's now desperately trying to replenish. The more you try to restrict, the more your body gets freaked and thinks it's going to be in danger again, so the binges will just hit harder. I know it feels so gross and you feel like you're disgusting, but you just have to let your body do it's thing. I don't mean to be mean here, but I'm imploring you from personal experience: it's better to pay now than pay later. The only way to stop a binge cycle is to stop restricting. That may mean your body will change (mine certainly did), and there's certainly a lot of accompanying emotions you'll need to work through, but it's better to stop it now than having this take over your life longer. I would recommend also reaching out to anyone you can trust (family, friends, etc) and let them know your struggles. It's easier said than done, but finding a good therapist and psychiatrist can make all the difference. It ended up being the case for me that a lot of my ED behaviors were symptoms of excessive anxiety and low self-esteem. Once I worked at the roots, I found that all the eating stuff also lessened. \n\nAnd I would also just ask that you be kind to yourself!! This is all honestly really traumatic stuff both mentally and physically. I'm sorry you are going through this.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767040646.0, "id": "nwlwx8p", "author": "RainyChips"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "title": "13 year old struggling with anorexia and when to involve doctor", "text": "My 13 year old step-daughter was bullied in school from the time she was 10-11 for gaining a bit of weight. Most girls do gain a bit in their tummy before puberty and we explained this to her. She has since started her period and thinned out a bit. She also has ADHD and we started a stimulant for her. \n\nI’ve noticed her restricting her portions and being very involved with cooking, and we had many conversations about “healthy” foods and how many calories you need in a day to maintain a healthy weight. I’ve kept an eye on her. but two weeks ago, it reached a point that I got more involved. She refused to eat for an entire day. I finally got her alone and I told her to “come clean” which resulted in a very teary conversation, in which she admitted that her younger brother has been calling her fat (more than once or twice.) We had a long conversation about that, and I told her to try and ignore his comments. She is not “fat” &amp; she does not need to be losing weight. She needs to focus on health. Eating more vegetables, strength training, water intake. Nourishing her body. I thought and hoped that would be the turn around conversation, but she persisted with saying “I’m not hungry” and only eating the smallest of portions. \n\nHer mother struggled with an ED in her teens that made her very very sick. She didn’t start having her period until she was 17, chronically underweight, they told her she may not be able to conceive. So, naturally, this is very very triggering for her. And I am not looking to place blame, but I think the disordered eating has continued, and some of this stems from her own self-talk. This also adds another layer of difficulty/confusion to the situation.\n\nWe agreed that we would give our daughter a 2 week window to try and start turning this around for herself, because she is afraid if we talk about the eating disorder to the doctor they’ll take away her stimulant and the stimulant really helps with the ADHD symptoms. \n\nWell, we are at nearly the two week mark, and there has been very little progress from my perspective. She is still vowing she’s “not hungry” when it comes time to have breakfast and lunch, and if we push, she’ll eat a few bites, and then eating a half portion of dinner. Enough to not be “starving herself” but not enough to maintain her weight. \n\nI’m of the opinion that we need to involve her doctor at this point. When I voice this to her mother she just says “I’m trying to be optimistic” and “but she’s making progress.” I don’t think she’s taking this as seriously as I am &amp; I think her own eating disorder is clouding her judgement about how we should approach this.\n\nI think our daughter needs to at minimum start CBT so they can try to help her challenge the script about “healthy/unhealthy” foods and the fear of gaining weight. We can encourage her all day long but all I see is her eating enough to pacify us, and praying we “drop it” so she can continue losing weight.\n\nI’m just looking for any other advice or perspectives. My fear is that the longer we delay seeking treatment, the more weight she’ll lose, and the deeper into the mindset she’ll fall.\n\n\nEdited to add:\n\nHer brother and his comments were dealt with. We were planning to have a conversation with him and she completely blew up at him last week, screaming “you’re the reason I’m not eating!” and so, that obviously led to further discussion.\n\nHe feels terrible, and cried, and apologized repeatedly, and said he was just making stupid jokes and didn’t realize she was taking it to heart. They’re 11 &amp; 13. Like sibling bickering “your mom” “your face” “you’re so stupid you can’t do multiplication” “you’re so fat” etc. He was blown away and said he had no idea his stupid jokes were hurting her and he doesn’t actually think she’s fat, he was just insulting her in their back and forth spats.\n\nWe went over the importance of not commenting on others bodies or what they’re eating/not eating, but I think her blowing up at him had far more of an impact than me pulling him aside and telling him to stop.\n\nAnd on a happier and healthier note: she and I had another conversation after I made this post, where I told her that I know she’s trying, but I am not a therapist and I don’t have a lot of experience with ED’s and I think we should talk to her family doctor. I told her that her mom doesn’t want to push her away or in the wrong direction, so she’s been afraid to seek treatment for her, but I don’t think we can handle this alone at home. She agreed and said she knows we’re all trying, but she thinks she should try to find someone for talk therapy at minimum, but knows it’s out of hand and she needs help. She said the times right now that she is eating, she is forcing herself to &amp; still doesn’t “want” to eat. I reassured her that we love her and will continue to do whatever we can to help. So, I’m going to talk to her mom tonight when she gets home from work, and hopefully she agrees, and we find her some actual help, very very soon.

When I read your post my 1st thought is you need to start family based therapy and get her doctor involved IMMEDIATELY. The longer you let this fester the worse it will be and I guarantee it is worse than you realize already. If she has gone a day without eating already that is a big problem. With girls this age things can go to a dark place fast and it is terrifying. My daughter’s resting heart rate got so low so fast we were afraid she would die in her sleep. You have to hit this hard, especially given the issues her Mother experienced which seem to have impacted her. \n\n\nI understand why you felt you needed to give her the two week opportunity to turn things around, but without any tools, support or guidance no lasting change will happen. This isn’t something she is capable of ‘fixing’ without treatment, she is sick and getting worse everyday. Also, I can see how some of the conversations in your household may be misinterpreted by her. As a parent the learning curve with ED is steep and we all find a million things we are doing wrong. A few things you will learn is that you don’t ever discuss calories or count anything food related with children suffering from ED. My child for example would obsess over the exact measurements of her meal plan and food groups, which is disordered. Food isn’t healthy or unhealthy, food is food. Everyone needs food to live. My child ate extremely ‘healthy’ food without any fats ever or carbs and it nearly killed her! My point is you’re in WAY over your head and may be making this worse, you need professional help from an ED specialist. If there is not an ED specialist nearby you need to reach out to Eating Recovery Center or Equip and schedule a consultation. Do not find a random nutritionist to help and psychiatrist etc, you need someone who specializes in pediatric anorexia.\n\nLastly, your daughter getting well is a TEAM / FAMILY effort. It will be dependent on everyone in the family putting in work to understand ED’s and how to manage it.

What I meant was more of “eating a balanced diet is important.” And then we discussed how each child needs to be eating around x number of calories per day to maintain a healthy weight and they were not hitting that goal.\n\nThe baseline of how food is talked about in the home is this: Food is how we nourish our bodies. Foods are comprised of carbs, proteins, fats &amp; we need them all at certain levels. \n\nOur aged 11 (boy), stopped eating butter suddenly on his toast and I found it odd and questioned him about it. His mom had made the comment that butter is “fat” and he took that to literally mean eating butter is going to cause him to gain fat.

She cut out sugar completely, minimal carbs, and only chicken and fish for proteins, and tons of salad and veggies. She’s been obsessive with her dieting. She’s been obsessive with going on daily walks. \n\nShe always feeds the kids three square meals a day and I know she takes care to not call herself “fat” but ranting about the weight gain was sure to have an impact on both children. And deciding to stop the medication that was helping her mental health due to the weight gain definitely made it appear to the kids that she’d rather be physically tiny than mentally sound. There was also a period where our 13 year old was on an antipsychotic (Abilify) and her mother refused to up her dose, despite daughter asking to increase it, because it could cause weight gain. and this potential weight gain was mentioned several times in front of our daughter. \n\nLike I said, it’s a slippery slope for me. I love her dearly and she’s one of my closest friends but I’ve witnessed the disordered eating firsthand and it’s why I’ve always kept a close eye on the kids and their eating habits.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1766961700.0, "id": "nwfzc2s", "author": "No_throwaway_8097"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "Thank you! I love her as if she were my own; we’re very close. Im so very glad that she’s been able to disclose a lot of this to me and be honest about her feelings (seemingly.) I’m really hoping she can get the help she needs without getting into the inpatient aspect, only because I fear that would do more harm to her due to her neurodivergence, and being in a strange environment. But I swear, I will be vigilant and I will be cautious!\n\nI blame the shared custody and my work schedule for it going as far as it has, in all honesty. When I was leaving for work in the morning, she’d tell me she wanted to eat at mom’s, then get to mom’s and tell her she’d already eaten. She’d have a small snack or push food around her plate for lunch, which was easy for mom to dismiss as the stimulant upsetting her appetite. Then when dad picks her up in the evening, she’ll eat a bit of dinner for him, go for a walk to make sure she burns off whatever calories she did have. \n\nI’m definitely the most authoritative of her 4 parents. And she knows I mean business. The day she confessed, I had taken us all for fast food. She was taking a nibble of a chicken nugget and acting like she’d eaten it and trying to discreetly put it back in the bag to then throw away once we were home, but she’s not that discreet and I’m not that stupid. I told her no one was getting out of the car until they finished eating; her two brothers were finished in about 10 minutes and I sent them on into the house. She stared at me for a minute or two and I said “okay, you know I’ll out-stubborn you, so go ahead and tell me what’s going on.” Apparently Mom had tried to talk to her literally 2 days prior and she just brushed it completely off, and so Mom didn’t push because she didn’t want to upset her. That’s not my style lol. \n\nBut yes, safe to say, we’ve already witnessed the manipulation tactics. She tried to convince 11 to lie to me that she ate an orange, and have him eat it instead. She’s thrown away her plate and lied and said she’s eaten it all, but the evidence (half full plate) is in the top of the trash. Thank God we don’t have a dog or she’d be giving it half her plate and trying to pull that one over on us.\n\nI’m just relieved that the overwhelming response was “seek treatment” because I swear her mother would just let this drag on and on out of fear of upsetting her. The comments about “positivity” and “she’s making progress” were just upsetting me. It seems an outrageous issue to try to brush off, especially with clear indicators that it is in no way going to get better without some intervention. I felt like maybe I was overreacting in some way by thinking the first thing we should do was contact her care team, but it seems like I’m in the majority with that vote.\n\nMom says she’s reaching out to the psychologist tomorrow morning about it &amp; have a referral sent for talk therapy &amp; whatever other steps they recommend to us. I will sleep a little easier tonight knowing we’re doing what we can to help her. She is such a wonderful child and she doesn’t deserve to suffer with this.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1766978072.0, "id": "nwhcltl", "author": "No_throwaway_8097"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "Hi, for the stimulant they might be able to give her a lower dose? I have ADHD and personally I can't say it affected my appetite much, maybe a bit the first couple of weeks (less than a month) but after that it has stayed basically the same. It will really depend on whether the medication benefits her more overall or not. I am not a medical professional but if she needs it to function, taking that away could also further increase her overall anxiety and make the ED worse. \n\nAs for the other things, obviously I think that if her mother also struggles with food and her own body image it will definitely be triggering. I understand your wife cannot be forced into eating more or not having her own feelings but I would maybe try and ask her not to make comments that could be triggering when your daughter is present. Even comments meant to be positive like about her eating more or looking healthier etc are super triggering. Another thing I personally find helpful is not to have any conversations around the dinner table that are negative or too emotionally packed. I personally also find that it is a lot easier for me to eat by myself (even if my parents are in the kitchen etc) while I watch a show on my phone as the distraction takes the focus away from what I'm eating. If she is feeling bloated after meals I would also suggest a heated blanket, hot water bottle or even taking a relaxing bath, for some reason it helps me get rid of the excessive bloating or I ask my mom to massage my abdomen (just not right after eating). \n\nI'm an adult (old enough to have a child) so the circumstances are very different and I understand that some of the things I have mentioned might not be ideal for her (like eating by herself for example) but I think most of it could maybe be helpful. Considering I have never myself suffered from an ED as a minor I can't say much about intervention from personal experience. From what I have heard and read over the years, the right type of intervention can be very helpful however it really depends on the approach and overall involvement of everyone in the family. I think trying to take away too much of the control won't be helpful in a lot of cases but giving some options for meals can definitely help. I think in any case, therapy for her will be necessary so she can address the root cause of her ED (it may or may not be strictly from being called fat) and given her mom also has struggled and is maybe still struggling with an ED, family therapy might not be a bad idea either. \n\nWishing you best of luck \n\nYou are clearly a very loving and caring parent to look out for your daughter this way.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "Oh so sorry for the confusion :) also due to the nature of EDs being quite deceptive, I would maybe suggest that at least for the time being it's probably best not to let her eat completely alone (she might hide or throw away food) but either an adult can be nearby doing their own thing or even you could try and watch a movie together and let her eat while she watches. That way you're close enough to make sure she is eating at least some of her food and it will still alleviate the pressure or anxiety that she is being watched. \n\nAlso something I just thought of about her brother making fat comments. He obviously feels bad and didn't realize the impact of his words. Although there isn't anything he can do to truly take bad what he said, doing something to try to make up for it could help their relationship. He could either buy her something that would bring her comfort or take her to go an activity together and tell her that he didn't understand how much she would be hurt and that although he knows he can't take those words back, he would like to do something or get her something that would help her feel better. I think that this is the best way he can apologize to her, it shows that he is truly wanting to mend his fault and seeing that effort from him will help her feel that he genuinely feels bad and will help her feel that her feelings for how hurt she felt are valid. I am an older sister so this is just from the perspective of being the \"older one\" and having to forgive the younger sibling simply because they \"didn't know better or didn't mean it\". \n\nI'm really glad that you found my comments useful.

My manager was there when he said this and is aware of my history. He addressed the comment after, which I appreciate, but I still cannot stop dwelling on it.\n\nI have already been struggling with body dysmorphia for the last few years and was already being particularly sensitive and self-conscious when this comment was made.

I also cannot stand virtual groups - I see plenty of options for zoom support groups, but I'll just dissociate unless it's in person. I've consulted with my individual therapist who can't seem to find resources that fit my need.\n\nJust could really use a low-time commitment, low-barrier, in-person, support group.\n\nFeedback:\n\nHave others felt like they're in a similar position?

Essentially you just sit in a waiting room for hours to get a 5 minute conversation with a doctor that just dismisses you. \n\nIm also afraid that IF they do some testing, that its all gonna come out fine and stuff and its just me being dramatic and overreacting and i wasted my time and everyone elses so i believe i shouldn't get medical attention", "score": 12, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1766933890.0, "id": "1pxt9wn", "author": "Adorable_Signal_6758", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1pxt9wn/heart_issues/"}

Even if they end up being \"nothing\", it's much better to advocate for yourself until a provider can tell you, in good faith, that  you're okay. You ABSOLUTELY are deserving of medical attention. \n\nI've had various heart monitors clock me as having a dangerously low resting heart rate with irregularities in my heart's rhythm, and three separate cardiologists told me that I was fine. On my fourth specialist, they finally took me seriously enough to run extensive testing. It took a stress test, an echocardiogram, and a CMR for them to finally find something \"wrong\" with me, which ended up being a failing heart valve (not caused by my ED).\n\nMy symptoms are always much worse when I'm restricting - I get chest pains, a murmur/fluttering, random spikes in my heart rate, etc. My point is: I'm convinced I would never have known I have issues with the structure of my heart if not for how vehemently I had to fight with my doctors to get more testing. My heart is already under more stress than average because of that, but the more unwell I am, the harder my body has to work to find energy. Our hearts are a muscle, and our bodies break down muscles for energy.\n\nI went through the same mindset of thinking I didn't deserve proper treatment because I was actively making my symptoms worse by neglecting my health. But the truth is that it doesn't really matter how you got there.\n\nThat all being said, it's especially true that if you have a documented history of an ED, it's best for you to get checked again, and again, and again - until someone takes you seriously. It's awful that we have to fight tooth and nail just to live in countries with healthcare thats eems less about treating us and more about wringing us of our time and money, but *you deserve to live*, and that means living a fulfilling and healthy life. \n\nAll of your testing coming back fine is a good thing.

Personally, it took until I was hospitalized for doctors to fully acknowledge the mental problem that I was having that is ed. Something that I've learned from my aunt, though, is to exaggerate the symptoms and concerns you are feeling and experiencing. Saying something more like the pain is constant and worse as opposed to occasional and something you can manage. Ironically, being dramatic is what it's going to take for you to be taken seriously.\n\nDo not think that \"I've done this to myself\" because that is not true. Eds are mental disorders that affect the way we think and live life, not something done on purpose despite it feeling like a sense of control. The tendency to those disordered behaviors is proof of that because if it was really something done on your terms, it could be stopped on your own terms. And even if there really is nothing, then you didn't waste anyone's but instead used their abilities and resources to ensure yourself that you are okay in the sense of heart failure and made sure doctors won't have to spend more time with an issue that could've been dealt with sooner. You are a teenager who shouldn't have to worry about any of this and, thus, part of healthcare's responsibility to help you in this, no matter big or small. Just worrying about going to sleep or heart failure in general should be addressed even if there were no symptoms.\n\nAsk for help. Whether you are seen as dramatic should not be your concern but instead focus on making sure you can continue living in the best condition you can be at.

I was in residential with multiple women over 50, so you won’t be the only one who may be stepping away from a busier life with kids and work and everything for treatment. If your therapist suggests residential, they are suggesting that because they think you need that level of care for treatment. There were visitation days at residential (Sundays) and for several hours people could have visitors. I went to res out of state so my family didn’t visit very often, but others had families who would come visit them and kids as well. We had phone time every evening as well so you could call and talk to your family, and we also could receive mail.\n\nIt is tough at first, but residential saved my life and I probably wouldn’t be here 8 years later had I not gone. As for work, most people I knew who were working full time jobs were there using FMLA leave/medical leave. Same with PHP. Intensive outpatient was a few evenings each week so for those who worked it was more doable, and I know some people in residential skipped PHP and stepped down to IOP. That is something your treatment team would ultimately decide if they thought it would work best. \n\nRemember, your family wants you healthy and well and happy, and your kids seeing you getting help will also show them that it’s okay to need help and it is SO brave to be getting help.

Have been keeping an eye on it. She has always been a very very slim girl. The other day she sent me a text saying she keeps feeling guilty if she eats unhealthily and is really worried she will get fat. I’ve told her I’m glad she has spoken to me and that while it’s good to eat healthily you should never obsess about it or worry etc. I reminded her that she is very slim and that her genes are that she has a slight build as well. I offered to find someone else who could talk to her if she thought that might be helpful. The last few days she has eaten some sweet things and she always asks if she can eat it or that she shouldn’t etc. I’m like first of all it’s Christmas eat whatever u want and also I’m just sit there stuffing my face with chocolate over Christmas too. I’m not overweight particularly just normal and I’ve never been one to worry too much about my weight. She was also saying things like she wishes she was dead and was going to kill herself when she was angry. This was about 6 weeks ago. I spoke to her and said I don’t like it when she says that because it scares me and she said well it shouldn’t.

If you are saying it to anger me please don’t as it’s really scaring and upsetting me. She’s not done this since I said that. I just don’t know what to do. I’m so worried.

Reassurance from a loved one can be very helpful as it's another sense of authority saying that you're good enough the way you are.

Not as a comparison or going into details as to influence further, but to offer a sense of empathy and understanding that you also know how it feels to not feel okay. Showing your own vulnerable side could help with her feeling safe to talk with you further without fear of not being taken seriously or as her simply being dramatic.\n\nThis is just me nitpicking as someone who developed an ed at eleven years old. Please don't take offense because I do not mean it as an attack on you or your parenting.\n\n- While I understand that by saying she is slim and about her genes to give reassurance, they can also act as motivators to stay slim or form a belief that if she steps out of that norm, she is doing something wrong. Instead, stray away from much focus on her body in general and more on she feels internally. Reassure her that she doesn't have to worry about her build in general as the main concern should be that she feels okay moving on in her daily life.\n\n- Similar to previous point, while Christmas is ofc always a valid excuse, excuses should not be needed to eat something. Whether she wants to eat something should not be so dependent on the excuses or justification of it, but whether she feels hungry or full. Focus on her being able to recognize when she wants something and when to know that her body is telling her she has had enough for now.\n\n- If expressing suicidal thoughts, while they can be scary, do not shy away from them. Otherwise, it can lead to her not saying more about it due to not wanting to worry you or feeling like you don't take it seriously.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "Ok….so what if the tests end up coming out fine? The doctors/staff still get paid, don’t they? This is for YOUR own personal health and safety.\n\nI had an eating disorder as well. It lasted three years. It was when I got down to a reallyyyy low weight and looked so sick (eyes popping out, face sunken in) that I realized I should just recover. \n\nI started recovery on August 9th of the year twenty-twenty-five (last year technically). It wasn’t a typical recovery where I went to an ED clinic and they made me a meal plan and monitored what I’d eat. \n\nInstead, I just gave myself the freedom to eat whatever, whenever I wanted. And I ate a looot. Like more than the average person. That was due to “extreme hunger,” which is a very normal thing for your body experience, given how long it had been starving of vital nutrients. It’s the kind of hunger that is very hard to ignore….no matter how hard you try to avoid it. \n\nI would be eating a full size meal for lunch and then starving to death right after….so I’d have to go find another food item to eat. And then maybe an hour or two later, I would still be hungry. If you do experience this (which you may, depending on how malnutritioned you were), it’s important to honor it. I honored it, and during the 3rd month, it diminished. \n\nIt was honestly kind of a pleasurable experience since I got to eat all the foods that I never let myself touch or get close to during my disorder. I eventually did reach a healthy weight for my height probably during the 3rd month (yes it was a super fast weight gain from being extremely underweight), and during just the 4th month of recovery, I ended up getting my period back after years of not having one. So if you’re someone who’s planning to have kids in the future, definitely take this into consideration.\n\nBefore we talk about heart issues, let me also tell you something I experienced during the first few months of recovery. My feet got super swollen. To the point where i could barely fit them into my shoes. One day my mom noticed how swollen they were and she freaked out and was like something’s probably wrong with your kidney (cause kidney issues sometimes cause feet to swell). She told me to go to urgent care and do a blood test. I did, and everything came out fine. It was just due to the new increased fluid that my body was not used to, so it stored it there. They went back to normal during month three. So if you do experience this throughout your recovery, I want you to not freak out like I did. However, please still go and get blood work, just to make sure all is well!\n\nNow on to the heart situation. When I went to urgent care to see what was up with my swollen feet, and they measured my heart rate and the doctor listened to my heart, he said it was beating fast. Even at home, sometimes when I would like move my upper body downwards, I would feel an aching on my chest…When I would lie down and try to go to bed, I would feel my heart beating fast….Sometimes I would have occasional aching of my chest just sitting normally or not doing anything. \n\nNow, this can be due to many reasons. One would be due to muscle formation on your chest and around your organs …..when you gain weight, you gain muscles as well, especially near your chest, where vital organs like the heart reside. Because you just gained these muscles in this area, you will feel some aching. \n\nAnother common reason why you may be experiencing chest pain is just due to eating more food than your body was used to. Because there’s more food in your system now, your heart has to work harder to maintain your body’s energy levels through metabolism. And so you will feel it beating fast, and sometimes experience chest pain. \n\nNow, despite me telling that what you’re feeling aligns with how your body would typically react after increased food intake from periods of starvation, you MUST go and get BLOOD WORK done. Go to your primary care physician for a check up! Tell him/her you want a blood test done since you’ve been feeling some pressure in your chest during your recovery. He/she will totally understand that and order you to get some blood work done. \n\nPlease Remember: You want to be safe, not sorry. You don’t want to avoid this and then months or years down the road be confronted with a dangerous health issue (like heart failure) and need surgery or meds for the rest of your life. Health is wealth, remember that. \n\nSo please go and make an appointment (right now, yes) with your primary care provider. If you don’t have a primary care provider, then go to an urgent care or a health clinic and get yourself checked out and request for a blood test.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767378638.0, "id": "nxaop3t", "author": "LocalConstruction578"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "EatingDisorders", "text": "I am right.  GW’s are not just plucked out of thin air.  Full recovery is about state, not weight.  Meaning, full recovery is only achieved when the ED thoughts &amp; behaviors are completely gone not when you reach a particular number on the BMI scale.  For many recovering ED patients, this means they need to keep gaining past the number initially calculated by their therapists and doctors.  Only then, does the brain begin to heal and recover.  A malnourished brain cannot heal therefore the body must reach a sustainable weight.  For some people, yes that means they do need to weigh more than what society has told us is “healthy”.  But full recovery means freedom from the shackles of this dreadful condition that clearly still has a massive hold over you. I am a mum who parented and refed her teen daughter through the hell that was anorexia.  You are saying the exact thing she said to us and her therapists.

Though it's definitely not as bad as other people seem to have it - it's still bad enough to impact my life quite a bit. I've recently decided that I really wanna work on my diet and being healthy, and I also want to enter a calorie deficit ideally.. I'm currently trying to figure out breakfast foods. But I don't live in the best situation, so I preferably need stuff that doesn't have to be cooked. I prefer being able to just grab and go.. So if anyone has any ideas, I'd greatly appreciate hearing them. Side note: please, please don't suggest oats or smoothies lol.

She told me a couple years ago that she had it under control now for the most part, and barely did it anymore. Her then boyfriend had hinted that that was maybe not the case as much as she portrayed it to be, but that it had gotten much better than before. \nThroughout the past at least year and a half I have noticed that every time she visits my husband and I, she eats a lot and usually purges right after. She also body checks in mirrors whenever she get a chance and works out almost every single day for at least an hour, on 2 days she works out twice a day. If she can’t she feels bad about herself.\nShe claims its a totally normal amount of workout, as she bases her routine on my brother’s workout routine. \nMy brother also, heavily restricts his diet, divides foods into good and bad, talks about regrets after not going to the gym etc..\nED and BDD are generational issues in my family that I can trace back to at least my great-grandmother.\nSo eating is an overall sensitive subject, but my sister is definitely in crisis the most right now.\nCan anyone help me how to voice my concerns about her purging again? What would you do?\n\n\n", "score": 0, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1766876466.0, "id": "1pxb8cp", "author": "LeaveThick6203", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/EatingDisorders/comments/1pxb8cp/how_to_address_ed/"}

Over several years I tried everything.. explaining, expressing concern, yelling, breaking down in tears, etc, I was lost and it was scary. I went to therapists to help myself through it and they told me to drop it for my own sake— one even said to let them die on their own terms ?!? (therapists can be toxic imo and many do not understand EDs).\n\nI think it honestly finally worked only because their life was so affected they couldn’t ignore it.
