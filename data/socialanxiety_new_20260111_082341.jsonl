However i feel like there’s more to it, my problem is ever since I got my confidence back I can interact perfectly fine with people and I have no problem with talking to them or initiating conversation my problem comes with being in peoples presence. I hate it and it feels like a weight on my shoulders, no amount of ‘resilience’ or building up my confidence seems to push away this deeply uncomfortable and overwhelming feeling that comes from being around people. \n\nMy past therapists and my parents keep trying to address my social interactions and talking to people but I really don’t think that’s the problem. It’s really hard to stop myself from getting very overwhelmed in these situations where I have to be near people or in their presence for a long period of time. I usually try my best to leave on particularly bad days or it gets to the point that I start to cry or have to step out. I usually scratch at myself to try and calm down. \n\nI prefer solitude and even in my childhood I only preferred one friend rather than a big group and didn’t particularly like them having other friends either.\n\nthis only started a few years ago which is why I assume it has something to do with anxiety rather than any neurodivergence which a previous therapist has brought up.\n\nAlso- I have tried propranolol which doesn’t seem to change this In the slightest unfortunately\n\nAny advice is appreciated because I’m very stuck and I’m losing motivation to get help.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "Making friends AFTER college is one of the bigger challenges of young adulthood. Just because the opportunities are fewer and people have less time. It's just harder, without a doubt! Old friends are often left behind or they've moved. Etc.\n\nSo there are two main ways to improve your chances. One is to look in places where you spend a LOT of time with the same people. And for young adults post-college, that's mainly where you work. Work provides opportunities for REGULAR conversations and people can get to know you better over time. \n\nThe second way is to get better at conversations. And I don't mean to make that sound easy. If it were easy to just \"get better at conversations\" then I guess everyone would already be awesome at it!\n\nBut, there are certain things that make conversations better. Here are a few of them:\n\n1. Having good eye contact/a smile. \n2. Asking good questions. Curiosity about others often leads to good convos. So not just \"what did you do\" but \"how did you LIKE it?\" or \"How'd you get INTO that?\" etc.\n3. Having a bit of passion, i.e. some ENTHUSIASM for: yourself, other people, life itself. Injecting a bit of social energy into what you're saying. This is something you can start doing at home or when you go out to someplace low-risk, like picking up fast food or going to the grocery, and practice seeing what your more enthusiastic tone of voice sounds like.\n4. Playfulness. That means being ready to laugh, not take life too seriously, just have fun with life. A non-serious demeanor (as long as the topic isn't serious.)\n5. Have a short tidbit about your life ready to talk about, something that happened that day or week, in case someone asks or the convo starts lagging. Best way to do that is to be more observant and write a few things down and review it before heading out to socialize.\n6. Speaking with more warmth in your tone. That tends to pull people in and create connection. Best way I can describe it is a similar tone you'd use to talk to your dog or cat, but not as silly.\n\nAnyway thanks for asking this question, it's a problem experienced by lots of people after college!", "score": 11, "created_utc": 1768058503.0, "id": "nysqp61", "author": "FL-Irish"}

Where I live, it’s either not talked about or brushed off as “shyness.” I was always told I was just shy, but I’d literally hide when guests came over. Later I realized it was social anxiety.\nOne thing I’ve noticed is that when I’m with even one or two people, I can talk fine , sometimes I can even take the lead. I think it’s because I don’t feel alone; there’s this mental safety net that I don’t have to carry the entire interaction by myself.\nBut when I have to do things alone, my anxiety gets really bad. I’m in my second year of college now, and I need to be more independent, but I still panic over basic things — going to the local grocery shop, approaching my college help desk, or even going to the dentist. I usually try to avoid it or ask someone (my brother, a friend, or my mom) to come with me. Even now with braces, my mom does most of the talking for me.\nWhen I try to figure out what I’m actually scared of, it always comes down to fear of judgment. I worry I’ll say something awkward, mess up simple sentences, or look weird ,even though logically I know a shopkeeper or dentist isn’t judging me. I rehearse basic lines like “Can I have one packet of milk?” in my head again and again, scared I’ll stumble.\nI know this comes from past experiences of being judged, left out, and feeling like I never say the “right” thing. This year, I really want to work on stepping out of my comfort zone and changing this.\nAny advice on how to start dealing with this would really help.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768003978.0, "id": "1q8oypd", "author": "Heavy_Stop_6337", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q8oypd/my_goal_for_the_year_2026_is_to_overcome_by/"}

But fear of things that hadn’t even happened yet drove me further on. I listened to fear, not my body. \n\nAnd then my body went into a fear based state too.. just like my mind. Both lived in fear and that’s when my body became weary. \n\nWe aren’t meant to be in fear mode full time. We aren’t meant to analyse every possible outcome or angle of a situation before stepping into it. These behaviours point towards deregulation - an unbalanced system that needs to be recalibrated. \n\nTherapy and medication have given me the peace I deserve. I was driving home tonight and just as I started to dwell on how I might have been perceived in work today, I paused and thought “what do I stand to gain from wasting my energy on this spiral?”\n\nAnd I chose not to engage with it. Instead I listened to music and let my mind have some welcome space. \n\nI can see the forest now and I’m protecting myself from getting lost in it. I really don’t care to stumble about in a state of exhaustion trying to find my way out. I’d prefer to just… not go in … and if I do start to wander, I try to catch myself and head back out before I get too deep.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "How I overcame/managed my social anxiety", "text": "I'm not an expert in psychology. This advice may not work for everyone. I just wanted to share my experience and maybe it could help a few people. Just remember you are not alone.\n\nBackground (brief):\n\nI was always a quiet solitary kid who had trouble making friends. My Mother moved several times when i was a kid up until high school to the point I kind of gave up on making friends and socializing. I had no siblings, my dad left when I was little and my mom would retreat into her bedroom with a bottle of vodka after work every day. So I was almost always alone. I would have near panic attack symptoms in social situations. Adrenaline, shaking hands, tight chest, difficulty speaking. I was a loner. I felt like something was wrong with me. I was always treated like the \"weird guy\" in high school and in college and with college jobs.  I always felt like everyone was always talking bad about me. And sometimes they would make fun of me to my face or when they knew I could hear. I tried therapy and drugs, (prescription and otherwise) with not great results.  I had no chance with women and I had no friends. I played world of warcraft for hours and hours to feel some kind of safe social situation. I had bouts of depression frequently. I realized that on top of social anxiety I really was actually socially stunted and under developed due to life's circumstances.\n\nI hated myself and really wanted to change. I'm now 40, married with two kids and although I am still an introvert, but now I can appreciate and thrive in most social situations.\n\nWhat worked for me:\n\nI first realized I really WANTED to improve my confidence and comfort in social situations. You may be happy the way you are that that is just fine. I was not happy. I was unbearably lonely and I HATED myself. I understand that not everyone might have the same self loathing to go along with social anxiety but it was a big part of my life back then and something I still grapple with from time to time.\n\nI realized I really had to attack the situation with everything I had. I really wanted to try my best to make every day I could focusing on working on my \"problem\". But my philosophy was always to 'fail forward' so to speak. You will try and you will fail and fail and fail but every once in a while you will succeed. Eventually the failures stop happening as much. As long as you don't stop working the problem you will eventually get there.\n\nI started listening to audio books, talk radio, interesting podcasts... anything where I could hear people talking and being \"normal\". It would give me at least SOMETHING to talk about when I was in social situations and helped me normalize hearing dialogue and talking. I listened almost constantly. When I was cleaning, driving, at the grocery store, in the shower, even at some of my more boring jobs. This is something I still do to this day.\n\nI went to therapy and tried anxiety medications. These did not work for me but you may have different results.\n\nI forced myself to go out to a college bar, by myself (because I had no friends).  I picked a bar that had a pool table so I wasn't just sitting at the bar by myself. It gave me something to do and a purpose for being there. I would even practice on my own at a pool hall so I wasn’t bad (confidence). I lived very close to this place so I could force myself to go even if I told myself I would just stay for 10 minutes and leave. It forced me to get up, groom myself, put on clean clothes and get out of the house, even briefly. But I would force myself over and over again into more and more social situations to try and expose myself to my fear little by little and also listen and learn. I would listen to people talk to each other. Friends, boyfriends, girl friends all of it. I felt like an alien studying human culture.  I would tell myself to just show up. Just go there and be there for 10-15 minutes. Stay longer if you feel you can but just go. And if I really wasn't feeling able to I would leave after those 10 minutes and retreat back home. But I tried. Eventually I got to the point where I could stay for a normal amount of time.\n\nI went through several jobs. Practicing how to speak with co-workers, improving social skills, still eventually getting a reputation as the weirdo awkward loner guy and moving on and starting over with a fresh start and a few more social skills. I would take whatever progress I made with my social skills to a new job and try and do better.\n\nI started to work out a little. Getting in shape improves confidence and any gain in confidence is useful. Find any way you can to gain whatever confidence you can. You can put on some headphones and still be an introvert at the gym. I was by no means a gym rat but I kept myself from being overweight with (mostly) good eating habits and a little time at the gym. But I was young and it wasn’t too difficult, for me at least, to not put on a bunch of weight.\n\nI eventually got a job in a more social setting. Before this I was mostly working line cook jobs in small kitchens like sports bars. Or retail in big box stores. Then I got a job as a bar back at a popular bar. Restocking the bar all night and keeping the place clean. (This was not at the same bar I would go to socially to play pool). But I was around other people having fun and being social all the time. But I could still put in some headphones and tune it out if I needed to. Every day I could have brief chats with people I rarely saw again or never again at all, and some regulars.\n\nAfter 5 or so years of this I actually started tending bar. Somewhere along the way when I was doing my pool playing loner thing I made a couple friends shooting pool. My best friend to this day I met and he was doing the same thing. He was there by himself shooting pool and we eventually started playing doubles with each other against other players.\n\nEnough time went by and I wanted a real job so I self studied to get a job in IT. I have been in IT for almost 10 years now and every job interview I have ever had in IT has seen 'Bartender' on my resume and mentioned I must be good with people.\n\nWhen I got my first well paying job after having 'excellent social skills' mentioned as part of why I got hired, I cried my eyes out on the way home.\n\nDating:\n\nDating was kind of a mixed bag. I am short for a guy 5’6’ and I started losing my hair in my early twenties and eventually just started shaving it off.\n\nBut dating wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. By the time I was confident enough to at least try to date I was older and it was harder to keep the weight off. But I knew being a short, fat, bald guy was going to make things incredibly difficult. I knew all I could really control here was being fat.\n\nI started going to the gym and (what helped more than anything) started counting my calories. \n\nI got on the apps and I wasn’t swimming in dates but I got enough to go on 2-3 dates a month. Girlfriends would come and go. The longest relationship being over a year. I actually ended up talking to the woman I am married to now on facebook. She was a classmate Jr. High and we just kind of started talking online. \n\nBe a good person. Take care of yourself. Present the best version of yourself and you will get some dates. Don't expect to not have to put in any effort though. You need to stand out. Lose some weight, put on some muscle, dress well and you will get dates. Don't expect every girl to be \"the one\". Expect to go on a lot of dates before you actually click with someone.\n\nAlso, don’t watch all those incel youtube videos complaining about women and become some angry red pilled guy.  It’s easy to go down that path if you already have low self esteem and social issues. It’s easy to **blame someone else**. But there's lots of women out there that are normal and want a real relationship as much as you might. And there are plenty it won't work with. Keep trying. Keep failing forward.\n\nConclusion:\n\nToday:\n\nThings aren’t perfect but they are pretty good, all things considered. I am not going to say everything turned out to be perfect.  Anxiety is stress and it leaves scars. I feel like my social anxiety cost me years of professional and social development. I never graduated from college. I feel old for having kids as young as they are and I worry about that. If I hadn’t had to spend so many years dealing with my anxiety, maybe I would have started a family sooner. I really struggle sometimes with anger towards my family for not noticing how badly I was struggling as a teenager and young adult and never trying to help or support.  I probably drink a little more than I should, I would drink to help me socialize and even when I was bartending. It is a habit I have not been able to completely give up. I still don't have many friends. Just a couple close friends. I was never able to make my way into a social circle and I still often socialize online. And for some reason, even to this day, *sometimes*, if I am talking to someone (usually about something I'm excited about oddly enough). I feel the tightness and adrenaline come back, just a little.\n\nI live with the consequences of my life every day.\n\nBut… I have a well paying job. A house and a car I own. And a wife and kids that love me. Overall I am a very happy and lucky guy.\n\nLook I know a lot of what worked for me will not work for you. And maybe you can’t go down that same life path. But maybe if you are in a similar situation as I was way back then, this might give you same ideas, or at least some hope. I truly wish I could give you a hug and tell you that you are not alone. Mostly because I wish I could go back in time and find my younger self and tell them that. But I can’t. I can only hope sharing my experience can help someone.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767988026.0, "id": "1q8i8of", "author": "Fearless_Flow_1220", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q8i8of/how_i_overcamemanaged_my_social_anxiety/"}

I pretended to be grateful, but I immediately felt dread. \n\nIm also starting to feel insanely guilty. The membership costed them over $200 and it’s one of those deals where you HAVE to schedule your first class within the first week of the month, you can’t just begin whenever you want. Going to sound like a complete negative Nancy here and possibly entitled, but I really wasn’t comfortable with my mom creating an account for me on their website, sharing my full name, birthdate, email, and phone number. I’m sure any normal parent would be grateful for this and think it sounds fun, but I was borderline offended that my info was shared then had my phone blow up earlier this week.\n\nI have 2 under 2 and the classes are meant for the older one (almost 2-year old). I don’t even feel ready to leave the house yet for anything other than errands due to the younger, almost 7-month old who goes ballistic when I’m not around. I’m sure a lot of parents would feel lucky to get weekly gym classes for free, but I don’t like the added pressure of having to start this immediately OR ELSE it’s not really free. I already called and scheduled a class for the 30th, so someone can watch the other baby while we’re gone. I already feel like I made a bad impression calling and asking about the membership. Tried to see if I could extend the start date, and they just kept telling me about openings this week and next week. I told them I couldn’t do it those times, and they just kept repeating the same thing. I got super tired and drained just from that one phone call. Babies crying in the background the whole time. The lady was really nice but yeah, the class I scheduled was $25 on top of the $200 already paid because it wasn’t “soon enough.”\n\nI’ll go to that one class for my daughter’s sake and see how it goes. I haven’t had a haircut in a year and because I’ve been pregnant twice recently, nothing fits me besides sweat pants and t-shirts. I’m having major fear of judgement… I’m deliberately taking multiple weeks to prepare for this so I can get my act together and not look like a total slob when I show up.

Im not a guy with a lot of friends. Ive met lots of people because i shift a lot due to my dad's job but after shifting i never really keep contact with them. While i was living at home, i didnt think i had social anxiety. i just thought that im an introvert and that i was normal. i had 1-2 friends and that was good enough for me. Fast forward to now, my first sem in college was miserable. Like i cannot put into words how bad this sem went for me. This was nothing short of hell. fuck that it was even worse than hell. My social anxiety peaked in college. like it grew to levels that just made me cutoff from anyone. i would notice the smallest of things. Whoever i thought was my friend, i constantly tested them. I would see if they talked to me first, if they included me, if they respected me. Stupid things like if i was in a group, and if i wanted to see if they value me, i would start walking and see if they walked with me or just talked among themselves not noticing that im gone. Well, these 'tests' my mind made, no one passed. as a result i began thinking that no one wanted me, no one here considers me as their bestfriend, and that im always a second preference. I just think that im just a floater friend, a guy who people dont care if im there or not. Social anxiety makes me question everything, like every small thing. Its made connecting to people really hard because i just end up second guessing. If the people i talk to dont pass these 'tests' i just cut them off in the name of protecting my self-respect. I just wanted to know if anyone here can relate to what im saying, and i know you guys may think im some idiot.

I trembled a lot when leaving home and going somewhere I didn't know; I didn't know how to behave, and there was even a time when I was ashamed and afraid to post anything on social media, even anonymously.\n\nSocial anxiety can be so intense that seeking therapy to solve the problem also causes anxiety, and you get stuck in this loop. I was exactly like that.\n\nAfter researching this a lot a few years ago, I saw that many people improved by gradually exposing themselves to situations that made them anxious.\n\nI discovered that anxiety is something very irrational. You will freak out many times without really knowing why, knowing that if it weren't for these feelings, you would be fine. Our bodies also don't react to this very well, so we have to get them used to these situations.\n\n\nWell, that's what I tried to do. Over time, I gradually forced myself into situations that made me anxious. I started by saying \"good morning\" or \"hi\" to someone in my class back in school, and that alone was enough to make me anxious and trembling, haha. I forced myself more and more, and I became calmer in those situations. The brain realizes, \"I've been through this before, and it's okay!\" I was very happy with each small achievement, even if it was just a \"hi\" to someone I didn't talk to much, and knowing that it was working and putting it in my head that these moments that I considered \"awkward\" were good for me, even if the feelings weren't good and said otherwise, helped A LOT.\n\n\nI forced myself to start a conversation with someone. I forced myself to look people in the eye more. I forced myself to ask the teacher questions in the middle of class. I forced myself to talk to people I didn't know online, and that's how it went... and today I'm much better! I did things that at the time seemed impossible with my anxiety, including getting a job (which also helped me a lot to force myself to socialize), and it helped me have a much larger circle of friends. And I'm sincerely proud that I managed to go \"so far,\" although it's more normal for some other people, it's a huge step for someone who suffered from the anxiety I suffered from.\n\n\nI still consider that I have social anxiety, yes. But not like a few years ago. It's good to remember that from time to time we have to do things that we consider uncomfortable in order to evolve in the future.\n\nSo please, expose yourselves more!

Plus autistic and ADHD people get a lot more negative feedback about how we socialise so we learn to over-compensate and self-analyse.\n\n\nI had a big leap in managing social anxiety when I learned more about that side of my brain, non-NT ways of communicating and realising that I can just ask and set boundaries around how I will communicate.\n\n\nA boundary I have is that I will not try to mind-read. I will take what people say at face value, if I think there is something I'm missing I will ask out right and I will respond as though they are telling the truth. I will not guess at intentions or emotions. I will not attempt to figure out what people are thinking and I will not take on responsibily for other people's communication.\n\n\nSometimes I can tell there is something more (like when I see an indicator that my partner is bothered by something and is denying it) so I will outright say \"I notice x-sign and don't know if it's meaningful, but I will take you at your word unless you say otherwise\".\n\n\nLike 99% of my social anxiety was from trying to manually work out all the unsaid stuff.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "My grandmother contacted my teacher to force me (18M) into a volunteer group after everyone picked their friends. I’m spiraling with social anxiety and feel humiliated. How do I survive this?", "text": "I’m currently facing a deeply uncomfortable and anxiety-inducing situation at school that has left me feeling overwhelmed with catastrophic thoughts about what’s to come.\n\nThe context is this: Students in my school who are struggling academically (myself included) are required to complete volunteer service hours at various community placements as a means of improving our grades. Our guidance counselor informed us that we have the autonomy to form our own groups and select our own volunteer locations. Predictably, this turned into a social sorting exercise where existing friend groups immediately clustered together, choosing their placements collaboratively so they could volunteer alongside people they actually want to spend time with, effectively transforming what is meant to be a remedial academic requirement into a social opportunity for them.\n\nI, however, have no friends at school. There’s not a single person I could approach to ask if I could join their group. What makes this exponentially worse is what happened next. My grandmother—well-meaning, I’m sure, but completely unaware of how this would affect me, took it upon herself to contact my teacher directly and request that I be placed into one of the already-formed groups. I’m eighteen years old. I’m legally an adult. And my grandmother intervened on my behalf as though I were a helpless child incapable of advocating for myself. The humiliation of this is almost unbearable. It makes me feel pathetic, infantilized, and utterly disgusting. There are deeper reasons why this particular dynamic with my grandmother feels so violating; layers of history and context I won’t delve into right now, but suffice it to say, this intervention has compounded my distress in ways that go beyond the immediate situation.\n\nRight now, I’m spiraling into an relentless cycle of overthinking, catastrophizing every possible scenario that awaits me. I’m imagining being awkwardly inserted into a group of friends who have already bonded, already established their dynamic, already decided how they want this experience to go. They chose each other deliberately, and now I’ll be the unwanted addition, the obligation forced upon them by a teacher who had to accommodate the kid whose grandmother complained. I can already envision their faces when they're informed I’ll be joining them.\n\nI have social anxiety, which makes every interpersonal interaction feel like navigating a minefield, and I haven’t spoken to virtually anyone at school in any meaningful way. The thought of being thrust into a group setting where I’ll be expected to participate, contribute, and socialize feels paralyzing. I keep imagining showing up to the first day of volunteering and feeling their resentment radiating toward me. I picture them talking and laughing together while I stand there silent and awkward, not knowing how to join the conversation, visibly not belonging. I imagine them wishing I weren’t there, counting down the hours until they can be free of my presence. What if they actively exclude me from their conversations? What if they make inside jokes I don’t understand, referencing shared experiences I’m not part of? What if they coordinate their schedules or breaks deliberately without including me, making it abundantly clear that I’m not actually part of their group, just someone who happens to be assigned to the same location?

The morning people. People who feels sleepy at like 7-9 pm and wakes up feeling energized at 5-7 am.\n\n2. Night people. People who stays awaken until 11-1 am (o even later) and wakes up at 9 am-12 pm.\nIf they wake up earlier, it will be forcing a computer to start a super heavy videogame at the very second you turn it on. And forcing them to sleep earlier will only led to frustration and them lying in bed watching the roof until they reach their natural hour of sleep. \n\nAll of this is just biology and evolution and it's not about who is lazy or who has bad habits. \nAnd the world is mostly made only for morning people. Most schools start at, at least, 5 am (or that's what schools do in my country). Colleges can start even earlier and the latest you can go to an office job is 8-9 am. \nSo, as you may guess, I have the bad luck to be a night person and the school schedules have messed up my sleeping habits to the point of me waking up at 5 am but sleeping at 12 pm.\n\nAlso, (what a surprise) messing up with you sleep habits can be very bad for you to the point tht it can induce anxiety, lack of attention, cancer risk, adhd syndroms in kids and the same behaviour as a really drunk person. \nNow imagine a child (in their development years) having all of that and nobody caring about that. Also, imagine that child making mistakes and having brain fog and exhaustion AND adults/children forcing them to socialise. \nIt's  obvious that I would mke mistakes, which made me hyper aware and anxious and that was what completes the cycle of SA. \nAnd even worse. Instead of people worrying of what is being done wrong, they just shift blame and tell you you are just lazy, and that you should stop watching tv or using your cellphone.\nBut that's not the only solution. And let's be honest. We ALL use our cellphones, at least, 2 hrs before sleeping. \n(Also, it's weird for me to use the cellphone at night).\nAlso, I discovered that I get more energized and social at 7 pm. How could I be social at school if it started 12 hours before that and ended at 1pm? \n\nSo yeah. Basically, most people who have mental priblems might actually be just kids who were forced to live an unhealthy life just because of social expectations and adult neglect and ignorance.", "score": 18, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1767937304.0, "id": "1q801oc", "author": "Least_Supermarket485", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q801oc/i_just_realised_my_sa_was_mostly_caused_by_being/"}

I have a few friends from high school, and we've known each other for about 2-3 years.  Despite enjoying spending time with them online and them being good people, I get unnecessarily fearful whenever it comes down to asking them to play games.\n\nI'll explain how excessively i can overthink these things.\n\nRecently, my greatest friend asked me to play games, and we had a good time, but I left fairly soon which he seemed a bit sad about, and I told him we could play tomorrow.  Feeling bad, I asked him later that night, but he said sorry, it was too late at night, and he had to sleep (it was in the AM at night, so yeah, very late).  He was very nice, and of course that was perfectly reasonable because he had to sleep.\n\nNow that the mentioned tomorrow has rolled around, he's online, and I feel paralyzed at the thought of asking him to play games.  It feels as though it is a crime for me to ask him in fairly short succession, and I feel like I might come off as too clingy or disingenuous even though he said \"tomorrow\" would be a good time to play.  I also fear that my friends, including him, would only say they want to game out of pity, and asking people to hang out or play games forces them to reach some sort of compromise between saying no or yes.\n\nIn this situation, I imagine a possibility that he would know I'd be down to play if he sees me online, and if he wanted to, he'd ask, but I also think that he might expect or think I would've asked first since I: 1) said we could play tomorrow, and 2) asked him to play late at night.\n\nThe inability to read people's minds has always hindered me as I got older, and I constantly feel as though I want to be asked to play/hang out instead of initiating first.\n\n*Please be kind; I know this is not ideal thinking and also a relatively small thing, and I was willing to consult the greatest possible place in search of information ;).*", "score": 2, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": 1767917267.0, "id": "1q7spkd", "author": "AngwyGamer", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q7spkd/severe_overthinking_of_whether_i_should_ask/"}

Next thing I know, my friend who I told the joke to went up and told my joke to the class and everyone laughed and praised her.\nI couldn’t stand myself after that, I couldn’t believe I missed the opportunity to make people laugh and show people my goofy side. Even then I knew I let myself get in my own way and I was so mad at myself for awhile.\nWell, this has followed me my whole entire life and replayed over and over again in varying settings and contexts and now I can’t help but wonder, if I had just gone up and told the joke that day, if that would’ve had a ripple effect and helped me gain just enough confidence to not have such bad anxiety talking in front of multiple people today. \nANYWAYS I’m curious what other people’s earliest memories are - please share! \n", "score": 51, "num_comments": 53, "created_utc": 1767904911.0, "id": "1q7nd10", "author": "Sea-Ostrich-", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q7nd10/what_is_the_earliest_instance_of_social_anxiety/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "Alright so, firstly, I understand feeling that way. I've felt that way before. When you feel like you're stuck in place and you're life's not going anywhere, it's normal to feel that way, I think. People want to have a reason to get up in the morning and a reason to see themselves as someone valuable.\n\nBut I would like the comment on some things.\n\nFirst of all, you have to keep in mind that as you say, you were bullied. It is very common for people who were bullied as kids to have very low self-esteem, including as adults. And it's also common for people who were bullied to underestimate themselves and be more critical and down on themselves than they deserve. And I think that's also part of why you feel this way. As if you're worthless and you have no skills, but that's the bullying talking, that's not necessarily you.\n\nIn this context having issues with social anxiety is also not that surprising. Our brains get trained on associations. If people were awful and judgemental towards you and bullying, it's normal that you'd begin to associate talking to people with fear and harm. This isn't your fault. This is just how our brains work, and to the extent it is anyone's fault, it is the fault of he people who treated you in this unacceptable way.\n\nAs for the rest...\n\nYou call yourself a loser. And I understand why you feel that way. Because a lot of societal messaging defines \"success\" as being rich, having a lot of friends, etc. But have you considered that societal messaging doesn't mean anything? Definitions of success are often set by certain types of people. For example, in the case of modern Western societies, a lot of them are set by extremely rich people who want to get richer. And they love defining worth and success in terms of your job and your money because, well, talking you into working more gets them more money. But that doesn't mean it's actually good.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that life isn't a video game. There is no \"win\" condition. You're the only one who can decide what YOU want out of life. You have a limited lifespan, like everyone, and maybe you should ask yourself given that, at the end of it, what do I want to look back and say my life was about?\n\nFor me that's a couple of things. Kindness and morality. I want to feel like at the end of my life I was as good of a person as I felt I could've been, even though I'll never be perfect, of course. I want to feel like I helped people and made their lives better. Learning. I value knowing things, discovering science, and art, and the mysteries of the world. I think understanding has great value. And writing. I want to write a book that really makes people think, and feel, and helps them the way so many books and stories have helped me. Looking back at my life that's what will make me feel it was worth it all.\n\nWhat is that for you, do you think? Looking back at your life, what do you think would make you feel it was worth it all? Because only you can choose that. Only you can choose what you're passionate about and what YOU value. The rest of society can't live your life for you. Bill Gates isn't in charge of your life and doesn't own you, you're in charge of your life. You get to pick what it's about. So maybe you should consider what you care about rather than what society's wealthy define for us as \"success.\"\n\nBeyond that, being socially isolated is of course hard for anyone. Humans are social creatures. We have social desires. But on that count, it is possible to get better. It isn't easy. It is hard work. But it is possible. If you don't already, go to a psychologist. If you've been at a psychologist for a very long time and that one isn't working out, don't be afraid to try someone else. The specific psychologist, your connection with them and their approach matter. I'd personally recommend cognitive behavioural therapy with an emphasis on learning helpful thoughts and exercises, ways to cope with stressful situations and exposure. But you're a different person than me, something else might work better for you.\n\nAnd realize that this is a long term process. Give yourself time. Because beating yourself up is only going to keep you stuck. Do you want to stay stuck? If not, you've got to do something and you've got to respect that it might take a while for you to do it, because overcoming anxiety is freaking hard. And you've got to stop pushing yourself down for finding it hard to do something hard.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767933323.0, "id": "nyjg45r", "author": "OneOnOne6211"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "I’m a 31 year old woman who has struggled with social anxiety for as long as I can remember. And eventually it evolved into generalised anxiety. \n\nI woke up one morning (2 years ago) and just thought “The way I’m living isn’t enough for me. I don’t feel happy. I don’t feel free. I don’t want this anymore.” \n\nI chose to throw that energy into a few huge life changes that day. I: \n\n•Emailed a bunch of local therapists checking on their availability/ fees. \n\n•Texted an old colleague who I’d wanted to keep in touch with… but had been too afraid to meet up with. Asked her to meet up. \n\n•Called my sister, who I hadn’t spoken to in several years, and warned her not to allow her children alone with our father because he’s not a safe person. \n\nAnd all those steps grew into bigger changes. \n\nI’ve been in therapy for two years now, I go every fortnight. I actually look forward to my sessions so that I can offload all the pain and problems. I’ve healed so much and have much healthier relationships with everyone, including myself, now. \n\nI’ve met up with my friend regularly over these past couple of years and our friendship has grown stronger - she’s very supportive and kind, like me. \n\nI don’t talk to my sister still. I said what I needed to say and I don’t let harmful people into my life anymore. \n\nI hope you choose to channel that ‘what’s the point if it’s going to be this hard?’ Energy into getting the help you definitely deserve. Therapy + one solid friendship have done wonders for my mental health. \n\nTake good care of yourself and know that you’re not alone in feeling like this.

I’m a virgin with no dating experience and a very small social circle — I have a few close friends, but I’m the only one who’s never had a girlfriend. Because of that, I don’t really have experience being social or single in group settings.\n\nI get especially nervous around women. Even just walking past women or groups of women in public (like at shopping centres for example) makes me tense up internally — my body stiffens, I avoid eye contact, and I’m very aware that I probably have a resting bitch face. I worry that I come across as cold, stand-offish, or uninterested, even though inside I’m just anxious and uncomfortable. This happens even when there’s no interaction at all, which makes everyday situations feel incredibly discouraging and frustrating. \n\nI’m trying to understand how much of this is social anxiety versus habits I’ve built over time, and how to start changing it in a realistic way.\n\nFor people who’ve been in a similar position, what helped you become more comfortable around women and in everyday social situations without forcing yourself into overwhelming environments?\n\nAny insights would be much appreciated.

I greeted the security guard at the train station good morning.\n2. I recited in one of my classes\n3. I greeted the school gardener good afternoon\n4. I walked without looking at the ground most of time. Tried to keep a confident posture.\n5. I sat in front of the classroom in my classes. But in one of them, I was moved to the second row due to alphabetical seating arrangements.\n6. I was able to eat at the school cafeteria, instead of hiding away somewhere where there was no one else.\n7. I did feel anxious before classes began, but I relieved it by meditating and telling myself positive things.\n8. I took the elevator instead of the stairs\n9. I introduced myself to one of my classmates and asked if we could be group mates for the course requirement.\n10. I'm sharing this on Reddit\n11. Offered to shake hands with my group mates when we first met. I stood up from my seat and extended my hand towards one of them as they were seated three chairs away from me\n12. Greeted one of my professors goodbye after class ended.\n13. accidentally stepped on some's foot at the train. said sorry.\n\nThings I think i did wrong\n\n1. In class A, during our groupings, I couldn't quite pick up what one of my group mates was saying as we were seated far apart. He had asked  each of us a while ago what our degree was, which I answered, and I couldn't register what he said next, except it had the word \"Psych\" so I said \"I'm not sure\". Then it hit me afterward that he was saying, \"I'm taking psych\"\n\nSo the conversation went along like this:\n\n\"I'm taking psych.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure\"\n\nGot embarrassed. New intrusive thought unlocked.\n\n2. In one of my classes, my seatmate asked me, \"Hey, you're (name) right?\" I smiled and just said, \"Yup\".\n\n3. It bothered me that I only smiled and said \"Yup\" so I was hoping after class that I would say goodbye and see you next week. I did not.\n\n4. In another one of my groupings, my group mates were talking about the courses/professors in their degrees. They all had the same degree except me. I didn't know what to say and had contributed nothing to the conversation. so I just looked at my desk and occasionally flipped through my phone--calculator app, gmail and all that.  (I was thinking, \"Should I say anything?\" Since they were talking with each other, although they were near me, I didn't really know if I was included in the conversation).\n\n5. Eye contact. Whenever I would look at my professors, my head would tense up so bad and involuntarily shake that I had to look away in order to resolve it. This has been the case with my high school teachers or anyone as well. (If anyone knows why, please please give me tips on how to stop this from happening).\n\nI ended up staring at the screen while the professors were discussing and would glance at them for one second and look away before that tense feeling came.\n\n6. Overthinking some of my classmate's body language. With what happened with my psych classmate, I felt embarrassed, and looking at them, at their body language, it makes me think that they think I'm weird/awkward, and I feel like I had said something rude.\n\n\\----\n\nAfter class, I felt discouraged and extremely demotivated. But after walking around campus, thinking about all the things I did right and all I did wrong, I realised, \"Hey, not bad.\"\n\nI still feel a bit embarrassed, but Im currently trying to think positive and just writing this down at the McDonalds outside of campus has made me feel better.\n\nThank you for reading this", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767856772.0, "id": "1q75d1e", "author": "Winged_Kiths", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q75d1e/stepped_out_of_my_comfort_zone_today_things_i_did/"}

(Really regret not thinking about this over winter break)\n\nBut not like I want to get straight into the medication, I'm talking about therapy and whatever whatnot they had. Like would that be something where I'll be pulled from school if I went down that route?\n\nAnd for deeper context, I think I had always known I had social anxiety ever since 3rd grade. I mean I definitely noticed it in some form at that age since I felt everyone was always judging me in some way and I became a recluse in 5th grade anyways. It really only got worse as the years went on. I was afraid to eat, go to the restroom, or participate in class that I so easily slipped into the background. \n\nI eventually only show myself to my classmates as the awkward, embarrassing loser who can't do presentations without shaking or taking long pauses. I don't know any deeper way to explain the feeling since I usually try to forget, but I could never manage my way in conversation or be more inclusive. I mean, every New Year's resolution of mine when I was younger was always to talk more and be more confident, but every year I just felt the same.\n\n I don't understand why I've been overthinking so much about loneliness once I became older, but the breaking point for me was around this New Year's when I was just trying to enjoy roasting my marshmallows and my dad ruined my mood, talking about my 'problem' right in front of me with my mom, and the disowning look they both gave me only made me feel shitty, especially since they said my indefinite future would be what happened to the lady who went insane in her house all alone, and I could only assume what that could mean since I don't know who they were talking about. Anyways, I definitely want to get help; I want to stop nodding and smiling nervously instead of speaking because I know damn well I fell down that habit in ELEMENTARY, and I'm so fucking disappointed it resurfaced now when I'm in high school that I hardly realized or noticed.

New jobs are hard, its just like that and fitting in with colleagues isn't an easy task. Social anxiety makes it way worse than it has to be though. \n\nET can help you for sure, maybe with getting better at small talk and setting certain boundaries so you don't get overwhelmed. \n\nIts really all about gradual exposure, starting small at a pace that suits you, respecting that pace, repeating and repeating until you feel comfortable and begin to slowly build confidence through positive experiences. Right now it sounds like you had some bad experiences and stayed stuck on these. Try again and teach your nervous system that its safe, that you can do this and that you got its back (meaning: that you will get it out of situations that feel overwhelming and let it cool down before trying again).\n\nSet small goals for yourself, like: \"I will stay for one hour\" or \"I will have two drinks\" and then don't be afraid to leave it at that. You can control the pacing of your life. You are allowed to be yourself also. \n\nI want to end by saying that you're not a bad colleague because you are quiet, shy, or even a bit awkward. If you do your work and do it well, are friendly, smile, greet ect most colleagues will appreciate you for it and won't care much about the rest.

When I got there I couldn't see if anyone was in the office so as I was halfway through the doorway I knocked on the door a few times and I saw a couple of staff at desks so I entered the office. I went up to one of them and I don't even remember what I said, I tried to explain the issue but I'm so bad at explaining things and I got so anxious. When I get anxious my mouth and throat get so dry so it's hard for me to talk clearly, I have a very weak voice anyway. The guy at the desk kept saying \"Sorry?\", \"What was that?\" etc., which is fine and I know that he was just trying to hear what I was saying but I got so embarrassed. The only person that could sort my issue wasn't even in the office at that time so he told me to come back later, which I did, and I got it sorted.

The frequency of some of these things can determine the strength of the current friendship. (old friends in distant locations are different in that regard)\n\nSecond aspect is the actual CONNECTION you have with the person. That means both people being invested in liking each other and wanting to connect (text, talk) and get together when you can. \n\nSo the first aspect is something you can work on just by reaching out more and increasing the frequency of your contact.\n\nThe second is more challenging because I feel it sometimes takes people a LONG time to get to the point where they have a comfort level being their best and most authentic selves.

Took it the first time for 1.5 years and have been on it this second time for a little over three years.

I’m great at hiding my anxiety but the stress of constantly forcing myself to push through it left me drained and depressed.

Since my depression is strongly tied to my anxiety, that has been reduced too. \n\nAs someone who has been in therapy for 10+ years off and on, I will say that for me the best combo has been therapy AND sertraline. And not CBT, which I’ve tried twice and had zero success with, but actual talk therapy. While CBT helped with a few practical tools for calming down when my anxiety is high, it did fuck all to address the root cause of why I’m so socially anxious in the first place. I’d recommend exploring that with a different therapist while trying out sertraline. \n\nI’m on 50mg, which is a sweet spot for me. My anxiety is practically nonexistent , I  can still cry and  feel all my other feelings and I have minimal side effects. I think 25mg is the starter dose and 50 mg is the minimum therapeutic dose.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "I want to ask out someone who has social anxiety and keep it as gentle as possible. How do I do that? Asking as an extrovert.", "text": "Heya! So I first want to clarify that I'm a rather shoot off at the mouth extrovert, babble on and on to receptionists or workers, wave and converse with strangers, and playfully tease unfamiliar people/also strangers. \n\nHowever, there's this person I've gotten in contact with. I've been speaking to them for a few weeks and they're the cutest person I've ever seen. They're anxious in a soft-spoken sweetheart way rather than a 'shut down and remain avoidant' way like some of my family is, considering I'm one of (if not the only) few extroverts in my family. \n\nThey've admitted I'm easy to talk to, and I find excuses to touch them fairly commonly such as hugs, playful scares, nudges, or lingering near them while always checking for signs of discomfort and remembering details when we're out, such as them disliking to touch gym equipment due to their hands feeling dirty and uncomfortable afterward, to which I then wipe down any equipment they might want or need to use in baby wipes first before handing it off to get rid of the icky feeling it has. \n\nThey don't really show any signs of discomfort around me aside from the occasional repeated phrase when I babble a bit too long, and they've mumbled that I'm cute before after I teased them, so I'm hoping the odds are in my favor here. \n\nHowever, my trouble is with knowing when and if to ask them out. \n\nSee, they never really answer their phone, even if I text, but they respond openly in person, and they've come to my house already and even asked to come back soon after Christmas which went both unprompted and enthusiastically executed, though due to them not really answering or reading texts, I feel like texting them is out of the question. \n\nAnother thing I noticed is when someone walked over to try to give them some foreign food, they were visibly shrinking back as I sat next to them and the person kept and kept asking them to eat it and repeating please until I saw they did. \n\nI know this seems irrelevant, but I noted the interaction in my approach.

How can anything we do feel natural when we are analyzing every detail, movement, sensation, etc? Somehow we have to trick ourselves into not thinking about or paying attention to ourselves at all, where existing &amp; socializing can be an automatic &amp; natural process like it’s meant to be. But I think it boils down to the fact that we don’t feel safe in these environments, &amp; we are so tightly controlling ourselves to avoid the perceived threat of judgement or being disliked.

Once you get rid of the insecurity you can relax more and not filter everything throught it. Or just be like me. No matter how awkward \"weird\" by whoevers standarts i may be. I just accept it and dont overthink it for even a second. I just accept that i act and talk with genuine intentions and whatever other people may think is not my problem to deal with.

The quiet personality doesn’t really know how to handle this, because the Ego comes off as intimidating or aggressive.\n\nIf this wasn’t the case then the quiet personality would never feel the need to have to lie or fluff in the first place.\n\n\nGet yourself some assertiveness training. There’s lots of books on Amazon kindle as well and YouTube videos.\n\nIf you look at the personality Myer Briggs chart, nice and avoidant comes under certain branches such as INFJ and a few others. \n\nIt means that some people are a magnet for narcissists or persuasive personality types. \n\nSo its a good idea to find out what the Myers Briggs personalities are and what it means in terms of navigating communication around people. \n\nI think lying usually stems from talking with people who are very confident or egocentric in a healthy way, sometimes arrogant. \n\nYou might feel a need to people please, to keep the peace and to remain avoidant, which is somewhat logical if the aim is to not want to deal with difficult controlling types. It’s often easier than being straight up and assertive with people, because we don’t want to hurt their feelings. \n\nSo assertiveness training can really help with the basics of knowing how to react, sort of like an unspoken negotiation. \n\nAssertiveness makes sure that you are respecting yourself in a healthy way. \n\nYou stop, think, slow down, breathe and go into the interaction with some preparation of ideas and forethought.\n\nFor the most part lying comes from having to deal with intimidating authoritarian types and not wanting to get into trouble, which stems from childhood behavioural issues where the parents or teachers were authoritarian types.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767739706.0, "id": "ny3fqr3", "author": "punkyatari"}

It had been a whole month and I hadn’t gotten better, I was still just as stressed as the first day.

It means the environment was not a good fit for you for right now.\n\nIt also makes sense that your mom’s response hurts so much. When someone dismisses anxiety, it can leave you feeling trapped and misunderstood. You were trying to survive a situation that was pushing you past your limits every day.\n\nOne important thing to hold onto is this: that job showed you what doesn’t work, not that nothing ever will. Anxiety often needs gradual exposure and the right kind of support.\n\nIf working becomes necessary again, starting smaller and quieter can make a big difference. Things with less social demand, fewer people watching, and more predictable tasks. This isn’t giving up. It’s pacing yourself.\n\nIf you’re able to, seeking therapy could really help, especially since you’re carrying this without family validation. And if therapy isn’t accessible yet, learning a bit about anxiety and how it affects the body can help you understand that what happened wasn’t you “failing”, it was your nervous system being overloaded.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "I’m 51 as well and still deal with it, but like you, it’s not as bad as it was years ago. A big thing that helped me recently was going through an 8-week IOP (Intensive Outpatient Program) for mental health. This consisted of daily 2 1/2 hour group meetings, five days per week, for the eight-week duration. And while it wasn’t specifically for social anxiety, it did help me tremendously by helping me to se that I could speak and talk in front of a group of people and also do various social activities with the group without panicking or having an anxiety attack.\n\nIt was probably one of the best things that I have done to help not only my social anxiety but my overall mental health. It made me feel less stigmatized and alone, because I quickly saw that everyone else was struggling and suffering in their own unique ways and that I was not the only one struggling. \n\nI did get nervous at times, but it was great therapy nonetheless. Those old mental scripts and years of conditioning that caused my anxiety are very hard to break, however, and I still notice myself reacting to or being bothered by certain people or certain social situations far more often than I would like, so I’m obviously still a work in progress.\n\nMoreover, I feel very bad that I forfeited so much of younger life due to social anxiety and depression. I often lament all of the wasted prime years that I spent walking around in a fog, basically, because I was so overwhelmed by anxiety and depression. I have a hard time just letting the past go and instead just focusing on what I can do moving forward.

Mind you, I had liked her for two years before this, but was too chicken to say anything and didn't want to screw up our friendship. When she asked me to be her girlfriend, I jumped at the chance, and was deliriously happy.\n\nBut then it went badly. The next night, I had the most severe panic attack I've ever had for seemingly no reason, and I've had on-and-off social anxiety since I was ten. I could only think that she was the cause. I called her (a sobbing mess) and told her I was far too insecure to be in a relationship at the moment. She said it was okay, and we could be friends. I felt a lot better after this.\n\nBut over the months, I feel as though we've slowly been slipping back into a romantic relationship without anything being said. She started calling me her girlfriend again, so I went along with it. I figured maybe a slow start would make me feel better, coupled with the new anti-anxieties I've been taking.\n\nNow I'm starting to feel overly anxious again. I went to her house a few days ago, and was so shaky on the drive over that my foot was spasming on the gas pedal. I wasn't even worried about it beforehand. But it was like my body was telling me 'no' for some reason. Today I had a mini-breakdown during school because I just felt so stressed around her. I don't know what's going on with that. I thought I wanted romance, but really, I just want my best friend back. I really want to break it off, but don't want to hurt her.\n\nWhat's going on with me?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "No friends/No", "text": "It’s hard to explain my relationship with socialization. I have severe social anxiety and have tried various things (medication, therapy, moving, studying charisma and social skills, etc) throughout the past 15ish years to get better, even had progress at times, but I feel like a lost cause at this point, or rather, I don’t really want to or care to be better at this anymore. \n\nI feel like in addition to social anxiety, I just don’t enjoy being in the presence of other people. I’m a huge introvert. I live alone and have no friends. It was about a year ago that I broke away from my most recent two friend groups. Neither of them felt authentic to me and I increasingly felt that I grew apart from these people and also did not want to be involved in the life choices many were making (no judgement towards them, I just didn’t want to take part in their lifestyles or.. I guess, be there for them when they needed me). I also felt like I grew apart from each close friend I’ve ever had in my entire life. I tend to feel like I grow and change very often and stop relating to those in my life. Then hangouts start to feel like torcher and I end things. \n\nI also find the responsibility of friendships in general to be overbearing. In theory, friendships and connections with others are what makes the world go around and makes our lives meaningful. But when it comes down to showing up for others, helping them out, attending their birthday parties, baby showers, weddings, having to hang out with them, etc., I just don’t care for any of it. I’d rather stay home by myself 9 times out of 10. I don’t like obligation. \n\nI also don’t like going out in public. I order my groceries to my house and I order clothes etc. online. I don’t like being in stores or having needless interactions. \n\nI do work full time and it’s mostly independent work but I sometimes have to interact with customers. I hate this part of my job. Once in a while I do have an especially positive interaction that I don’t mind, though. But that’s about it. I don’t really interact with coworkers as I don’t have to in my particular job. I have before, but don’t want any sort of relationships with them, whether that be friendships or just getting to know them as acquaintances. I keep to myself. \n\nI don’t go to many family events like birthday parties etc, as they give me anxiety and I just don’t enjoy them during the fact. I do have contact with my parents and siblings which I am grateful for, it’s just not the closest relationships. I am very different from my family in terms of personality and beliefs. \n\nMy whole life I’ve felt very abnormal because of this. It seems most people just have their circles that they stick to and each day they want to go socialize. Being an adult makes it harder because there’s literally no one pushing me to do it. I don’t want to so I don’t. There’s a part of me that wants friends (or feels the pressure to have them, I can’t tell which) but I don’t care for feeling socially drained and obligated. I don’t want to be relied on or expected. \n\nI do however fear there may be no one at my funeral one day. No one I’ve impacted or built meaningful connections with. That seems very sad. Or maybe it’s okay?? I’m not sure.

I've consistently noticed this. It's as simple as saying some original or honest thought and it triggers a defensive response in people because it shows them too sharply that they aren't in that space themselves.\n\nBut separate to this, we are desperately lacking community.

Something to take note of is, (And this is for everyone) you're probably far better in social situations than you give yourself credit for. The mind can be a beautiful thing, but it can also be our downfall. Me for example, simply going up to the reception desk asking for something felt like an absolute nightmare about to become reality. Guess what? It went perfectly normal, got what I came for, and didn't make a fool out of myself despite what my mind was telling me is gonna happen. Sometimes you just gotta tell your mind to F off and stop overthinking it. \n\nI'm extremely lonely and for the first time in a long time last night I felt an absolute physical type of pain, can't explain it other than extreme loneliness, I don't have a GF, and have very few friends. \n\nI'm tired of being like this, I'm sick of my mind keeping me as a prisoner. It's been keeping me there since I was around 14. Stay away from ANYTHING negative on the Internet that could make things worse (trust me, you can go down some nasty rabbit holes) Remember,  whatever your mind is telling you is gonna happen, it won't and even if it does go bad, you must fail to learn and improve, but it will NEVER be as bad as your mind makes it out to be.

Also, yes, I smoke weed, but these thoughts started before that. I’m mentioning it because I know Reddit loves to dismiss arguments by attacking the person making them. This isn’t paranoia or a weed-induced spiral; it’s something I’ve been thinking about for a long time. I genuinely think social media is one of the most harmful things we’ve introduced into human life. Not the most lethal thing ever, obviously there are worse, but in terms of slow, widespread damage to mental health and how we experience life, it’s up there.\n\nWe were never meant to constantly know what everyone is doing, from seeing Brazil before visiting to checking on hundreds of people at once through Instagram stories. The human brain just isn’t built for this. We are supposed to have a limited number of meaningful relationships, yet people now have thousands of followers and constant exposure to other people’s highlights. That exposure leads to comparison, body dysmorphia, status anxiety, and people hating themselves for not being “far enough” in life. I’m 20 years old and sometimes I genuinely feel doomed because I haven’t “made it” yet, which is insane because outside of social media that thought barely makes sense. Without social media, life feels slower, more rewarding, and more content. Connections feel deeper, and progress feels personal instead of performative. It takes away your energy and love for school because you’re already stimulated from being online so much.\n\nPeople always say life was better in the 80s, and while I don’t think boomers lived in some perfect utopia, they did get to experience the world in a more exploratory way. You discovered places by going to them and discovered people by actually knowing them. Over time, advertising, media, and now social platforms slowly slipped into everything. Now it feels like life is pre-experienced. Nothing is mysterious. Everything is optimized, filtered, ranked, and compared before you even get to live it. I don’t think people are meant to be this visible, evaluated, and connected all the time, and what scares me is how fast my generation and the one after adopted this without really questioning the long-term effects.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767620443.0, "id": "1q4lych", "author": "Glittering-Ear4857", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q4lych/we_are_all_doomed_social_media_is_messing_with/"}

Both of us confirmed that we only talked to each other, not multiple people and joked that we were 'semi-taken'.\n\nThe thing is all were well except it took so much for him to get on the phone with me(only once but it went well, for an hour), let alone initiating a date. Although he told me he also wanted to meet me in person and he liked me but it just didn't happen, due to weather, holidays, birthdays etc. A week ago he finally asked me out for the upcoming weekend but no solid plan. As the date got closer I finally asked him if he could send me the plan and after a long while he said he can't do it and we should stop texting. It was so sudden and hurtful. The timing was sus.\n\nI believe he has SA because he told me one thing he wanted to change about himself was his lack of confidence. He told me he felt awkward because he thinks other people think he is awkward and he never asked for help because he feels like he is bothering people. He told me he always left a function early and has never approached a girl in life.\n\nI politely replied to his text that I understand and thanks for letting me know. But then I suddenly realized it could be his SA that stopped him because he has to finally go on a date with me and he just couldn't do it and decided to end it all. After a day I reached out telling him im sorry if me asking felt like pressure to him and caused his emotional withdrawal, that we can chat or if he really wanted to end it, no need to reply.\n\nIs it true that for people with SA, texting and voice memos are easier but phone calls and dates are difficult and challenging to navigate?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "I think I'm defective", "text": "I (19M) actually think I'm defective in that I'll never make friends, and it's like I'm cursed. I don't have social anxiety as I can easily start conversations, give presentations etc. but I, especially since age 13 have struggled so so so hard making friends. It's like when I was conceived there was a random spinner that had a 99% chance of landing on \"normal kid with normal social life\" and 1% chance of \"abnormal kid with no social life\" and it seems like I landed on the latter. I think it's just in my destiny to never make friends. It's weird considering in elementary school I was fairly normal and had a good amount of friends but since age 13 (grade 9) my elementary friends slowly distanced themselves from me and since then I've really struggled making friends. I never went to any parties, semi formals, Prom, after-school hangouts in high school, etc. Every single day after school I'd just be in the house because I had no friends to do anyhing with. Also I wasn't depressed at all from ages 13-17 then it suddenly came to me like a brick in the summer of 2025. And it actually has affected my mental health a lot over the past 7 months (I might be depressed?), to the point that when all this started back in the summer, I was taking two summer courses at my university and I failed both of them despite me usually being an A student. I've now decided to get therapy at my university for my social issues but I don't think it will help that much given it's only short term.\n\nIn fact everyday it's like I go through 5 stages of grief in that I accept that this might've been in my destiny since I was born, I think I'll always turn people off, I will never be able to have a normal social life, and I'll probably never get married either (even though I think I'm decently handsome-looking but not like anyone would want to marry someone with no friends). I didn't have any friends all throughout high school and it wasn't by choice. I had three temporary \"friends\" at various points but one by one, within a few months as they hung out more and more with me, some aspect of my personality kept repelling them. In fact one of them keeps messaging me but just like once a month, and everytime I read those texts I get so mad, that we actually had the potential to be great friends, and do things together. But no, because within a few months of our \"friendship\" he started subtly telling me that he doesn't want to be friends with me anymore and that his own friends found me weird and he'd be embarassed. I'm actually so sick of this shit I think there is something wrong in me in that everywhere I go I turn people off once they get to know me. It's so weird considering in high school a lot of teachers liked me and even noticed how lonely I was and some would even ask me why I seemingly didn't have many friends. But the truth was that literally, and I'm not joking - but literally half the guys in my grade ostracized me, ignored me, and made fun of me, etc. even though I never interacted with most of them. They just had some personal vendetta against me even though I did nothing to them.\n\nAt the start of this school year in university I swore I'd put in more effort to make friends and I made one friend so far and we hang out a bit, but even then it seems super one-sided in that most of the time I'm the one to text him and most of the time I'm the one to ask him to hangout and now I'm accepting that he also probably thinks I'm weird and I'm back to square one. At this point I've accepted I'll not have the typical university experience of friends, parties, etc. and that my 20s will be a waste as well where I'll just sit at home while everyone else goes out on weekends with their friends, etc. I might as well just kms at 40-50 I can't stand living like this.

I have never got anybody to look at me with that sudden respect. Even the silence I made after saying tht got them more scared.

She thought I’d just walked through to get from one side to the next since there’s a front and back entrance- front is on the Main Street, back leaves you in a little shopping mall.\n\nBut I’d stopped and looked at plasters and I know she saw me. She just… felt like exerting control and thought I’d be silent and meek. \n\nShe rubbed off of one of my emotional wounds though.

She told me to leave and I let her know that I’d be glad to &amp; I wouldn’t ever be back. And so I haven’t. \n\nWhen I took that experience back to therapy, I realised two things: 1. People who try to control me for arbitrary reasons are rubbing off an open emotional wound; 2. Being seen as young and ‘less than’ rubs off a wound too. I’d speculate that she wouldn’t have the nerve to do that to someone who looked older and more confident in themselves. \n\nHealing is messy.

I know I sound like an ingrate, but I can’t help feeling this way. I have hated myself for my entire life. I don’t mean to speak ill of my parents, but I believe I was emotionally neglected growing up. They never really did anything to plant confidence in me. I feel that I have very weak character. To this day, I have no real motivation or direction in what I want to do with my life. My education is not impressive and I was never the most intelligent or well-rounded person. I started driving much later than everyone and I got my first job at 19, which I really struggled with. I also struggle to maintain friendships, but it is mostly other people who have slowly ghosted me. It hurt so much because I was trying to think positively while forming new friendships and I was still abandoned. I’m not a bully or super toxic. I feel like I’m too boring and useless though. \n\nI understand that not everyone has to like me, but I really don’t think it is possible to not have any meaningful connections with people and be mentally healthy. I’m 24 now. I should have had a life by now. I should have a good job and a group of close friends. I feel unready for a romantic relationship. How can someone without friends get married? I don’t want my husband to be my whole life. I wouldn’t be interested in a man who has no close friends, honestly. Therefore, I doubt anyone would want me. Close friends are a testament to your character. \n\nI feel so unlovable. I don’t have any friends who seem to want to spend time with me as much as I do with them. I’m kind of a secondary friend or a family friend, but they never initiate anything. I had a couple friends in the past who I was close to, but I haven’t felt like myself with them in years. I’m so scared of people leaving me. I feel like I have no core personality. My spiritual health is obviously in the gutter. I’ve grown a little resentful towards God, unfortunately. Did He write this for me? This life devoid of self-worth and close relationships? Even when I prayed to Him to please grant me close friends, I struggled. I tried to make plans with people, but they didn’t really continue the effort. I’m trying to tie my camel, but I feel like this is it. It’s over for me. I hate myself. It’s too late. I’m already a 24 year old girl who missed out on making lifelong, meaningful friendships. \n\nThe only way to be lovable is to change everything about myself. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been so depressed and hopeless. I tried antidepressants as well, but my problem is low self-esteem. And I can’t love myself when no one loves me. That’s not how humans work? Even under my mental health issues, I guess I’m just not a good enough person. I want to be more caring and talkative and kind, but I just can’t. \n\nI’m sorry for such a negative post.

So, I'll avoid being needlessly syrupy about my two-cents. For the first part, let me say, I relate a *lot* to what you shared. I'm nearly 27, and I have no friends, and even when I did, I was always more of a back-up friend than a primary. While I won't speak for you, I'll say that *I* often put myself in that position without ever realizing it. \n\nFolks with anxiety tend to do that. We have these narratives in our heads about how horrible we are, how unlovable we are, how unworthy we are. Naturally, our actions fall in line with our thoughts, and we act accordingly. We push people away because we think we're unworthy and unlovable. We isolate because we tell ourselves we can't make meaningful connections. That isn't to say that we're bad people, just that we need to work harder at rewriting our internal monologues than an average person. \n\nFollowing the ending of my marriage, I realized that self-love absolutely *has* to be independent of how other people feel about you. Like, it's ***essential*** that how you feel about yourself not be tied to the opinions of others. When my ex-wife loved me and was being super attentive and involved in our relationship, I felt great about myself. But when that love dried up, my self-worth took a nosedive that I'm still trying to recover from months later. \n\nMaybe it's just the fact that I'm older than you, but I really don't think that 24 years old is too old for things to change for the better. Granted, like most things in life, it comes down to what you choose to do from here. I don't have a miracle cure for what you're going through, because in a good number of ways, I'm going through it too and having a hard time navigating.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "I feel that, and have/had many of these problems myself (sorry for talking about myself). Buying groceries or going out into the public in general takes a lot of mental preparation time. As a teenager I avoided using public transport because of panic attacks, I never made any long-lasting friendships at school and that didn't change much during college. And, oh god, the acne - same, I tried every skin-scorching cream under the sun with little success, it only went away in my mid 20s. I keep necessary social interactions (like with a cashier) at a minimum and completely tense up/avoid eye contact/speak very quietly whenever a relative stranger tries to make some small talk with me. In February I'll start at a new workplace after having been jobless for almost half a year, and unfortunately it'll be a very social one. I've already got a sinking feeling in my gut and would like to quit already, but well, a human needs money to survive. :D\n\nThat being said, it does get better - gradually, and due to small increases in social interactions. Riding trains or taking a bus is a manageable issue now after having forced myself to do so often enough, and so is eating out with my family in a restaurant, though that'll still leave me drained. I'm able to buy groceries now, even if I still dread it every time. I've gone to therapy, I can make and go to doctor appointments (where I'll still be a nervous bundle, but it's something), I'm trying to work on my sense of self worth by connecting online with people who have similar interests and hobbies, and find it increasingly easier to talk to people who I've known for some time, which gives me hope of finding irl friends. I want that so badly. Well, not a LOT of improvement here, if measured by a normal standard, but it feels like the world to me. \n\nOkay, I'm obviously bad at this and talked about myself only in an attempt to show you that I can relate (I'm sorry if that has been obnoxious, truly, I don't know how to do this but I want to try), but I've told you that to show that there IS hope, even if your current situation feels bleak. You sound so much like me ten years ago - and you absolutely DO have a personality! You mentioned video games, which is a valid and varied hobby, something many others and I could spend hours with. It also sounds like you've got a serious case of depression - y'know, with the loss of interests, lack of motivation, self-loathing, which can overshadow a lot of inherent positive qualities. Depression is an a\\*\\*hole like that. You're pursuing a college education, which is awesome! You took your time to lay out your issues here in a concise and well-written manner, which I take as a sign that you do care about yourself, too, and it also means that you do know how to communicate. If you can do it by text, then there's absolutely the possibility that you'll be able to do it spoken (spokenly? gespökened? via the spoken word!) one day. You want to change, and that is GREAT! Truly! :D And nope, it's not just forced optimism here, I'm being serious - isn't the first step to anything to write out what bugs you, to share it with someone, to find people who have or had the same issue(s)? It has to start somewhere, and that's definitely a start. :D \n\nA different user in this forum spoke about \"slow exposure\", and I think he's got a point. There's no sense in looking towards the top of the mountain right now, for now, the first 10 meters are all that count. Stuff like forming a loose routine, regular meals (if you don't have them), taking a walk outside on the regular, far from people, just so you get out of the house for an hour. Give yourself a pat on the back for every college assignment done, try to answer one WhatsApp message every day, and so on. I'm seriously rooting for you. Ah, funny advice - talking to myself helped a bit, at least for me. Imagining conversations and playing them out within my own four walls like a theater play, trying to retort to my own sentences, studying rote answers for ordinary, every-day situations until I was able to say them without much thought (still stammering, but better than nothing). :D \n\nYou could also try to form some friendships here in this subreddit, since those folks will be unlikely to judge you. I'd also say that online friendships are still real friendships, and it helps to ease the feeling of loneliness. My DMs are open for that, if you wanna tackle the social-anxiety-beast together, and I'm sure the same goes for many others here, too! \n\nThere's also therapy to consider, but I understand that that may be too much as of now because that's simply a lot of pressure. My first try at therapy was awful because of that (makes for a funny story involving three cats), and it made me avoid trying it again for nearly three years because it felt like too much too soon. Still, therapy is an option you should keep in mind since it does work, if the therapist is good. \n\nAnyways, this reply is far too long already, and I'm sorry if there's been little of value here. Just know that you're seen, that you're not alone in your struggle, and that there's hope, always.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "This is _not_ a friend. \n\nPart of the process of regrowing my self worth, after a lifetime of abuse, was learning who to allow near me. And shutting down abusive / harmful comments meant to make me feel small, isolated and unworthy. \n\nI’ll give you an example. Someone close to me invited me into town to see the Christmas lights with him. I chose to go with him, but the crowds in town were very full on for me. They always are. He’s aware of my social anxiety and how I’m impacted. \n\nI felt up for the challenge, but I needed to mind myself through it. Rather than walking next to him, I walked behind him. Since people were walking at us, it felt safer to me to just trail behind. That was my comfort zone in a situation that was chaotic. \n\nOn the drive home, he gave out to me. Told me that nobody he’s ever gone into town with has walked _behind_ him ..rather than next to him. He told me I was weird. \n\nHe was trying to make me feel isolated, small and unworthy. \n\nI told him that his behaviour (trying to shape me to him) was unacceptable and that it made me feel unsafe with him. \n\nAnd since then, I haven’t gone into any challenging situations with him again. I don’t plan to either. I’d be better off going in on my own- I feel safe in myself. And I feel proud of myself for taking on challenges like that and moving in ways that are right for me. \n\nI’d like to suggest that you come home to yourself by taking distance from this person - his behaviour is very harmful. \n\nDoesn’t matter what his intentions were… all that matters is how he makes you feel. Anyone who makes you feel unworthy does not deserve space in your life. \n\nYou don’t have to respond to him. Sometimes silence is the most powerful choice because you’re protecting your energy. Harmful people who consistently behave this way live in a reality that serves them- no amount of logic or understanding will touch them when they choose to live in a false world of their creation. \n\nOP, you are better off alone than in the company of someone who harms you like this. \n\nPlease speak to a therapist so that you can heal and seek out people who actually deserve you.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "Let’s Make 2026 the Year We Start Overcoming Social Anxiety", "text": "I’ve been struggling with social anxiety for the better part of my life, and I’ve decided to make 2026 the year I actively work toward overcoming it. No matter how impossible my anxiety-ridden brain tries to make it seem, I know it’s possible. And I truly believe that’s true for all of us.\n\nI know it won’t magically disappear on its own but if we’re willing to do the work, even imperfectly, change can and WILL start happening.\n\nI wanted to start this thread as a kind of call to action. Something that might inspire someone reading this to take a small step, set a goal, or just feel a little less alone. Let’s try to keep ourselves accountable and work toward loosening anxiety’s grip on our lives, together. Just trying to spread some positivity, because I know a lot of us could use it.\n\nI’m in my early 30s, and for a long time I thought this was something I’d simply grow out of. I figured one day I’d wake up as a confident, no-fucks-given adult. Unfortunately… that didn’t happen. I still struggle. It affects my professional life, my confidence, and honestly I’m sick of it.\n\nBut just being sick of it doesn’t change anything.\n\nSo I’ve learned I have to tackle this from within and slowly chip away at all the annoying symptoms:\nthe racing heart, the overwhelm, the dreaded presentations, meetings, (seriously, who invented the “let’s go around the room” thing? lol), the fear of phone calls, getting teary-eyed, the anxiety before the anxiety-triggering event, the fear that people will notice you’re anxious… the list goes on.\n\nBUT the silver lining of living with this for so long is that I’ve learned ways to slowly chisel away at the monster. And even though I still struggle, I can honestly say I’m better than I used to be.\n\nI’ve learned the importance of not overthinking everything, staying grounded in the present moment, being kinder to myself, maintaining a supportive inner voice, and recognizing victories big or small. I’m learning how to let anxiety exist more as background noise instead of the main narrator, while I try to actually enjoy living my life.\n\nI also think it’s important to say this: a little anxiety is normal and sometimes even necessary. But we can’t let it spiral into something that completely hijacks our lives and convinces us we can’t function.\n\nIt’s definitely easier said than done. But small improvements really do stack up. Day by day, they start to rewire how your brain responds. Think of the Japanese concept of Kaizen, gradual improvement over time. If we start making small changes now, we could be unrecognizable by the end of 2026.\n\nAnyway, I feel like I’ve rambled enough.\n\nIf you’re reading this: don’t be afraid to speak up. You’re not broken. You’re not alone. And I truly believe we can overcome this or at least get it to a place where it no longer controls us.\n\nLet’s do this.\nAnd yes I’m channeling the Shia LaBeouf meme energy: JUST DO IT.", "score": 123, "num_comments": 46, "created_utc": 1767492906.0, "id": "1q3dhks", "author": "FollowTheRabbit777", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1q3dhks/lets_make_2026_the_year_we_start_overcoming/"}

I haven’t started therapy yet, I start it later this month but I’m keeping an open mind going into it. But yeah I also tend to compare myself to others at work who are around my same age and honestly it makes me think negatively about myself so I try not to do it too often. Most of the time it’s because I see them thrive so easily in social situations that just feel like such a huge obstacle to me. But I’ll keep working on it and hopefully they won’t seem so huge anymore. Someone sent me a message recently talking about self-worth and they said something that resonated. We have to grow our self-worth from within and become the owners of our self-worth, accepting ourselves as who we are. I think that’s part of the key to overcoming anxiety, recognizing our own values as a person and deeply believing it to be true. It takes the power away from external factors making you feel less worthy. Again it’s easier said than done. But it’s something we can look into improving. \n\nAlso having small talk here and there is great, the more you do it the better you become at it. And friendships sometimes come from these little small talk interactions. It’s true that making friends means more interaction but you don’t have to force it. If you’re naturally less talkative and more of a good listener that’s fine. I tend to be that way too and that’s fine. Just be yourself. A friend will accept you as you are. It helps to try to find some common interests so you can both talk about something you both like. Takes a little shooting in the dark sometimes, you know something like “sooo do you like..” but it works out in the end.\n\nAnyway, keep working on yourself, slow progress is still progress! Remember to celebrate the progress you have made, make your brain think of the positives. If you did some successfully then it can be repeated.

I went out to eat with old friends last night and saw another one this morning for brunch. I am texting back the friend of a friend right now. I find it easier when I act right at the moment instead of letting me time to overthink everything. All went well even though I feel stressed afterwards. But I don't really have other people around me and I wonder what other objectives except small talk with strangers or sendings messages I could find.

I don’t really see it as a failure, you tried, and that alone takes courage. I’ve been there too. Sometimes I fail, sometimes I succeed but think I could’ve done it better. But the big thing to note is that we are trying. Sometimes we only realize later that the goals might have been a bit too big for where we were mentally, and that’s okay.\n\nI really relate to what you said about socializing just for the sake of it. I’ve learned that forcing myself into situations or with people that don’t feel aligned can actually make my anxiety worse. It’s totally fine to realize not everyone is “your people,” and it doesn’t mean you’re doing exposure wrong. It’s more about finding the right fit, like you have with your old friends.\n\nI also completely agree that things go better when you act in the moment instead of giving your brain time to spiral. Overthinking is one of my worst enemies too lol. Our minds are way better at inventing disaster scenarios than predicting reality.\n\nFor me this year, I’m realizing a big part of the work has to happen from within, and of course with some exposure. I’m on medication, which helps, but I’ve realized that the medicine can only help so much. The biggest shift I’m trying to focus on now is rewiring how I talk to myself and how my brain reacts to anxiety. Things like celebrating small wins, remembering past successes, building self-acceptance and self-worth, and practicing techniques to quiet intrusive thoughts (I’ve been looking into CBT-type stuff, grounding, staying present). I think improving the internal (psychological) part of it is what will really add up over time.\n\nAnyway, I’m rooting for you. Keep working on it! Small, consistent progress really does accumulate.

Because let's face it, even when you think you have \"overcome\" it, you go somewhere and BOOM, you feel the nerves start to kick in. At this phase I can usually reel it back in and even if I can't, I've learned to be comfortable being really fricking uncomfortable. I compare it to acting normal when you're high AF. People might see you're a little off but they won't know you're dying on the inside. I have my routines. I know my triggers. And I know the self-talk that improves the overly intrusive thoughts of negativity coming from my own brain. So, anyway, overcoming it is a big leap! Be kind to yourself. Learn to embrace the anxiety. (It helped me to remember that fight or flight doesn't mean DYING. It will pass.) Listen to yourself. Find what works for you. Challenge yourself.

But if I need to confront someone in a higher position than me at work, I usually tend to avoid it — until they confront me themselves. \n\nThe other day, I was sitting at work when a colleague of mine marched up to me and started yelling at me. I didn’t do anything wrong especially in terms of the job itself, but they were “offended” by something I did, which was not intentional. Outside of immediately becoming anxious with my heart basically beating out of my chest, I tried to defend myself &amp; explain myself but it was done so poorly, and my voice was so shaky along with the whole rest of me. When they left, I could not relax for the entire day. I was still lowkey shaking all over and was jumpy with every interaction I had with other colleagues. \n\nAnother time, this same colleague confronted me about how my question to them was rude (I asked them if they were joining us on the car ride home). I honestly was so baffled by this that I simply folded and apologized. \n\n\nSo the title comes into play here: how can I deal with a situation like this? I find it almost impossible to breathe through it and try to “keep calm”, especially in a confrontation like that in front of other work mates. And I often feel like I cannot stand up for myself, especially since they have seniority and I joined only a couple of months ago, and they’re literally 10~20 years my senior in age. I just feel so powerless and like a ball of anxiety. \n\n\nAny tips or help would be greatly appreciated.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "The bullying part is so real. In the ending of 6th grade I got publicly humiliated by one of my “friends” in my friend group, till this day I still don’t know why she yelled at me (I couldn’t make out a word she was saying) and she tried to hit me but I would’ve split her fucking face open so luckily she didn’t get any hits in, but after that I’ve noticed that my other “friends” started to distance me, and then bam! Over summer break (entering 7th grade) they all started to argue with me in the group chat. Not even ONE person defended me, I handled it on my own. \n\nWhen I came back to school, the FIRST DAY one of them told me that her friend wanted to fight me, we never fought but it just got me so sad that they lied and manipulated me to make me look like I’m a bad person. I should’ve never even have been friends with them in the first place because I always had a feeling that I was the least favorite in the friend group. \n\nThey started to bully me and make fun of me for the whole year, and it wasn’t only my ex friends, it was also other people. I would stand alone at recess and I would see them point to other kids I don’t even know and they would just laugh at me. Sometimes while I was walking to the bus stop, I’ll have kids who I don’t even fucking know yell and harass me. All because of a stupid fucking misunderstanding. They continued this till 8th grade, and the only good thing about that year was graduation day. Getting the fuck away from those people\n\nWell… I thought so, but my opps were in my classes freshman year, they no longer gossiped or verbally abused me, but they did give me dirty looks or would just straight up smirk at me. For sophomore year, luckily none of them were in any of my classes, but my lunch so I would literally just eat in the bathroom so I wouldn’t have to see them (and I also because I couldn’t make any friends, due to them giving me social anxiety).\n\nI’m now a junior who has transferred into a new school (very small, yet I’m still anxious) where nobody knows me so I don’t have a bad reputation and I luckily don’t get bullied, although, I’m still that awkward, quiet, boring, “weirdo” who doesn’t even have a single friend in any of her classes, and eats lunch in the classroom to just listen to music while everyone else is having fun during lunch.\n\nEven crazier thing, I haven’t went to gym class ONCE this whole year ever since I gone to this new school, I do this because I have no friends and I have flashbacks of me being awkward at gym not knowing what to do, how to stand, how to play, who to partner up with, while being laughed at. My gym teacher saw me for the first time a few weeks ago and I told him why I never go to first period gym because I live far (which is true) but sometimes I come early and just stay at the diner to get breakfast knowing that I already ate that at home or wander around random places to avoid getting there early.

I slowly just felt more and more misunderstood by those friends, and it made my social anxiety soooo much worse. I’m such an observant person so I notice energy shifts so easily, mannerisms, glances with other friends when they don’t think I notice, etc. \n\n…..having that much awareness of your environment is both a blessing and a curse tbh lol😅\n\nI will say though, one game changer for my social anxiety was practicing self empathy more often versus just picking myself apart or assuming that I was the problem in every situation. I was too hard on myself, and then I’d put unrealistic expectations on myself or not be able to act fully like myself, and that made my social anxiety soooo much worse, too. If you are super hard on yourself, try to practice self empathy like I said. It really shifts your own perspective on things and puts a whole new angle on how you view situations like this. I think sometimes it’s easy for people like us to assume that we are somehow the problem , but any good friend would’ve kept making an effort, and if something was bothering them, they could’ve communicated it and given you the chance to try to work on whatever it could be. The second they don’t try to communicate with you what’s going on in their mind, that instantly means THEY are not the friends YOU deserve. And that’s only IF the reasoning could be personal… \n\nI know it’s easier said than done, but try not to assume it’s anything personal. We all battle ourselves sometimes, and for all you know, they could be deeply insecure themselves or something.

But when anxious, we try to micromanage the process and it just ends up being awkward because that is not how our brains were meant to be used.\n\nI'm glad to see that your sense of humour is safe from the muffin's shenanigans xD\nI recommend getting some more of them and showing them who's boss, first in a comfortable space and then out in public again. It's easy to go down the route of avoidance and let the muffins win but you will end up like me, unable to eat even around loved ones anymore. Don't let it get to that!\n\nAnd remember, anyone who judges you for how you eat or drink in public isn't someone whose opinion should matter to you.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "I used to struggle with this a lot. Honestly, this was the point in anxiety where I felt like my body was crying out for help. \n\nI was stuck in a catch 22. If I tried to gain exposure, people could see my symptoms and it made me feel more self conscious. If I did nothing, it wouldn’t get better. \n\nThat’s when I took myself to a therapist and began to unravel the anxiety and heal some of the layers beneath it. 2 years of therapy (every fortnight) and 8 months of medication have left the watering eyes in the past. \n\nI denied that it was a symptom of anxiety for a long time because I thought if it was, it could not be fixed. But it can improve massively with the right help. \n\nI also had some eye tests done (before deciding I needed a therapists help) to try and address the physical symptoms. I was given eye drops and special eye glasses for my work (I’m on a computer for 7 hours every day for my job). Once I gave my eyes the things they needed and ruled out a physical cause, I went to deal with the emotional cause. \n\nMight be a good idea to rule out a physical cause first. And then, if you land where I did, know that it’s curable with the help of a therapist. Anxiety tells us that these things aren’t fixable and we have to just try and hide them. But healing shows us that we have to meet ourselves where we’re at, allow people to see our wounds and give ourselves a whole lot of care and kindness along the way. \n\nI hope you get the help you deserve.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767443834.0, "id": "nxfgo5q", "author": "Brilliant-Light8855"}

I did try to open up to him alittle bit about how my life was going bad and that I was just not hopeful for the future, but eventually stopped since I didn't want to burden him with my problems.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "text": "Thank you for your kindness. \n\nI can relate to that so much. I actually moved to a new country when I became a young mother. My partner (father of my daughter) struggled with depression. He told me that he’d really struggle with his mental health if he moved to my home country… and so he asked me to move to his. And I did. \n\nNow obviously this is a way more costly example - I gave up my home country in an effort to protect his mental health and raise our child together… but the concept of giving too much still applies. \n\nMoving here was really destabilising. Not only was I a young mother… I was socially excluded by the older mums in the posh community we lived in. Financial struggles were very real and scary. We lived with his family and they were not good to me at times. Anxiety and depressive symptoms grew in that environment and I’ve carried them for over a decade. It definitely affected my ability to be the mother my daughter deserved. \n\nReflecting on that time in my life, now that I’m more financially stable and managing better, I formed a new belief system. It says: \n\n“Don’t ever sacrifice your wellbeing for the wellbeing of someone you love. If you do, in the end, everyone’s wellbeing will suffer.”\n\nI found that when I gave more than I felt I could / did something that felt like ‘too much’ I really suffered. And then my family got a lesser version of me because I had nothing left to give and no way to repair the damage on my own. \n\nThat life lesson / new belief system is something I’ve used many times since. When faced with a decision, I weigh out the cost to myself and the gain for the person I love. If the cost to me is my wellbeing, I dig my heels in and say no.

He: implied that I wasn’t busy because I have an ‘easy’ role … put down the functionality of something I designed (and mentioned that he knows I designed it) … and overall was a big sarcastic condescending asshole. \n\nInitially, my wounded self thought “why’s he doing this to me? What did I do to deserve this? Maybe I should just answer him and pretend it didn’t happen / move on. I shouldn’t be so sensitive.”\n\nAnd then my true self came out. She said: \n\n“He’s rattling your cage to see whether he can rattle it harder next time. He feels challenged by your kind and calm energy (it’s in sharp contrast to his) so he wants to rip it down eventually. I know how this goes and I will not pretend it didn’t happen. I’m going to trust that this is inappropriate behaviour that I absolutely did not deserve and pass it to management.”\n\nHe got spoken to. He apologised. He’s stayed well away from me ever since. And I feel safe because I believed myself and sought protection before it escalated further. \n\nWith your manager, obviously he does hold some power but you can lay down professional boundaries. \n\nStuff like “My medical history is my personal business. Is there a reason you are asking me this personal question?”\n\nIf he asks something and you don’t know the answer… tell him “I don’t know” and ask him to fill you in. \n\nIf he reacts with anger when you make a mistake, tell him “we all make mistakes, now let’s focus on the solution.” And redirect his useless energy. \n\nIf he’s aggressive with you repeatedly, it’s worth telling him that it makes you anxious when he gets angry about mistakes. You’d work better with support and solution oriented thinking. If any issues arise with your work and he corners you or makes you feel dumb, analyse where it’s coming from. Is it lack of training? Is it a process gap? Or is it human error?\n\nIf it’s training, tell him and ask for training. \n\nIf it’s a process gap, tell him and suggest a gap cover for consideration. \n\nIf it’s human error, shit happens. If it happens repeatedly and often, that’s a performance issue. One offs are just a natural part of the learning process. \n\nThis is coming from someone who used to manage a team. I moved into that role after demonstrating leadership qualities- staying solution oriented, laying down firm boundaries, asking for help when I needed it and identifying training / process gaps to drive improvement. \n\nHope this helps.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767469976.0, "id": "nxhunpz", "author": "Brilliant-Light8855"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "why is socialising and actually responding to texts so hard for me??!! I'm trying to do something about it but I always feel like I am not making any progress, and it just gets worse", "text": "Just to preface I haven't been diagnosed with social anxiety, and I am not one to self diagnose, but I always feel like I have some form of it, like at least a bit of it – when it comes to being scared of talking to strangers when i need something to socialising with my friends (that and OCD of the intrusive thoughts kind, but I won't get into that here)\n\nIg I just wanted to rant about how debilitating socialising is for me. There are days where i'm fine with others and can talk in person and online alright, but then something happens in my life that just causes me to avoid going online or socialising with anyone for like a day or two. i do consider myself introverted, so I anyway need to recharge my social battery after a hangout with friends, but when something ruins my mood, I just cannot talk to anyone, even my own parents. I am also notorious for not responding to text messages (and sometimes calls) immediately. One reason is that im not online cause of my mood, or health problems where I just sleep the entire day (dw I am absolutely trying to take care of my health LOL) Another reason is I dont like calling for some reason (ig the feeling of not knowing what to say in that moment? which also applies to texting) and whenever I get a text from anyone, i get heart palpitations and sweaty hands. i have no idea when this started, but I have always been an overthinker for a lot of things.\n\nThe reason why I'm writing this post is bcs of a situation that happened with one of my friends. For context, this friend left our friend group a year ago, but then we got back together, but ever since then I've been overthinking every interaction with her (and my other friends lmao bcs sometimes i feel i am left out, but merely bcs i am doing something wrong). But this particular interaction was where she invited me to hanging out with her one day. On that particular day I remember that I was sleeping most of the day cause of having not great sleep, and the next day I didn't look at my phone (also I didnt get a notification of her messaging me at all bcs my insta was on sleep mode and it didnt show it at all 😭) until mightnight bcs ofc for new years i wanted to wish all my friends, but that is when I see her message and I just get a waveee of like, dread? idk how to explain it, but I was so so so mad at myself for not seeing it sooner. Like how shitty would it be if that was me, being left on delivered when im trying to invite someone somewhere? that is why i dont invite people anywhere, that and the fact that im always scared of rejection, or feel like id be boring to people, or that something will happen and i'll have to cancel the plans (also goes for when others are making plans). it's like I wanna hangout with my friends, but all the overthinking that happens just puts me off, and even tho i have a good time with them (sometimes i do feel like left out, but again mainly cause i just feel like im hard to talk to), the overthinking repeats every time and i can never avoid those thoughts in my mind (my mind is a hell hole basically lmao)\n\nnow i did realise that even if i saw that message sooner i wouldnt have been able to come bcs she invited me to go somewhere on that same day where i didnt have a ride (if I am right bcs she didnt specify the time, so im assuming she meant on the same day), but STILL. i felt so horrible. i messaged her back as soon as i saw it apologising but when i see it through her eyes it absolutely seems like an empty apology. it doesn't help the fact that she has mentioned that i never message her back and stuff like that, to which she is defo right. I have tried to message sooner, but either stuff around me happens that i cannot reply sooner, or i have some problems going on internally which makes it hard to do really anything other than tryna distract myself. There are many times where I'm watching something, and I get a notification from my friends, but I just leave it be bcs my stupid mindset is that 'oh i'll reply in a few minutes' or 'i'll wait a bit to think of what to say' and then i get distracted and FORGET. and then when I remember I feel so guilty and shame and i avoid going online, which delays me replying back to them, which starts some vicious cycle. then when i come back online i make some shitty excuse bcs i rlly doubt they'd understand my thought process and still wanna be friends with me 😭 (though there are times when my excuses are actually right lmao, just that it makes it seem like im lying bcs i always have an excuse). it sucks bcs sometimes I believe I am an alright friend, but this one flaw of mine (and probs a lot more lmaoo) just squashes those beliefs and makes me think I am a bad friend/person. to the point where even if i do become better at texting sooner and stuff like that, it wont make much of a difference bcs it would be too late or they dont care anymore.\n\nperhaps self awareness is a big step to helping whatever it is i am going through, but my gawd is the process of trying to heal myself so hard. whenever i try to make a step forward, i somehow end up making 100 steps back UGH.\n\nim so sorry for this very VERY long post. this was mainly just me wanting to rant and let out some feelings that ive been trying to understand for so long. i absolutely dont expect anyone to read ALL of this lmaoo ('ll put a short summary below anyway), but to whoever does, i applaud u and i hope ur brain isnt fried. but thank you so much! and if there is any advice id love any LOLL\n\n(**TL;DR bcs i just realised how much I rambled on LOL**): my *possible* social anxiety makes socialising exhausting, where i have days where Im alright, and days where I just dont talk to anyone bcs of something that ruins my mood (usually overthinking). It has also caused me to be horrible at responding to texts quickly, bcs I always postpone messaging and then just forget to respond for a day or more, causing me to be in a negative cycle of avoiding texting cause of guilt and then making up some shitty excuse later (tho sometimes it is true bcs id have some other stuff happening). Texts and calls also always give me heart palpitations and sweating for some reason that I haven't figured out why. Also doesnt help that I overthink a LOT, be it fear of rejection, being judged, being boring to others, or just that something will happen last minute where id have to cancel the plan (these reasons are why i avoid inviting people places too). I am absolutely aware of this, and I rlly do wanna change. I just dont know where to start or how to do it.

I have a friend who has bad social anxiety, I reached out to him 3 years ago after we separeted at the end of highschool, and tried to be supportive for a good long while. He also tried to reciprocate my efforts, but in the end, it only overwelmed him, so we stopped texting for his comfort, it's been 4 months now. I very much like him and it pains me to know he's stuck where he is. I am also in a moment of my life where I've been and still am really lonely so I guess I kinda stick to him because of that (not only but still), and not being able to exchange just even a little bit really upsets me. The question I'm asking myself right now is : how long before he gets better ? How long does it take and how long should I stick around ? It's been 3 years now that I have reached out and recontacted him, and probably 4 to 5 years at worst that he has social anxiety and can't function anymore.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "Why can't I bring myself to talk to people around my age? How do I stop overthinking?", "text": "I'm 18M (turning 19 soon), I've had social anxiety for a lot of years. The pandemic fucked me up and I ended up dropping out of school before I even really started high school... since then, I haven't had a SINGLE real interaction with anyone in my age range. I played a ton of video games from like 13-15 (didn't socialize and hid in my room), 16 was a good year for me, I got out and did a lot of cool things, but I still didn't socialize really at all with anyone my age. At 17 I had really bad mental health and didn't really leave the house at all, and this year (18), I was super close to going homeless and that took up my year. I feel like I haven't even aged since I was like 16, my mental development is all fucked up because of how much shit has knocked my life off the rails during a crucial life development period, and all I really want is just IRL friends that I can relate to, hang out with, maybe do some crazy spontaneous shit, and live life.\n\nProblem is, I can't socialize with my peers. I worked on my social anxiety in general, I can spark up a conversation with literally anyone out in public... unless they're like 15-23 for some reason. I immediately start to feel judged and like the pressure is on me, even if I wanna say something, I just freeze. My brain starts to overthink \"I should say or do this... no, that'd be awkward, that'd be embarassing, etc\" and it makes me upset because I'm literally losing years of happiness because of this. I really want friends, so I think maybe my brain just sees people closer in age to me as potential friends, and I don't really get a lot of opportunities to talk to my peers, so when I do get one it's like \"I have to be perfect\" which makes me say nothing at all.\n\nI was just at an event and there was someone around my age there. I told myself I was gonna talk to them and try to become friends, they were awkward, but I was gonna try to break the ice... At first we just stared at each other the whole time, then we just avoided looking in the same direction as each other. It was weird. I don't know why I couldn't bring myself to just say hi or something. Still really annoyed at myself for it because the dude seemed friendly to everyone else, he probably would've been friendly to me too, I just had to make things awkward.\n\nAlso, it's not just me freezing up or not talking when this happens. I get competitive and I start to act like an asshole. I have no idea why because I literally wanna be friends, I'm a nice person, but when I'm around someone my age I put on this tough persona where I don't smile, puff my chest up, etc, and it's just a natural reaction. It legit makes me look and feel like a dickhead and I don't know how to stop doing it. I think I'm just intimidated because of my own fear of judgment.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "socialanxiety", "title": "Hypocritical mom admits my loneliness is \"partially her fault\"", "text": "This happened recently while we were having a conversation about school, friendships, and similar things. I'd like to point out that my mom (dad just agrees with everything she says) has always been incredibly mean to me about my social anxiety, always making me feel like a burden, an alien, and a disgrace, even though she tried to play the victim or sometimes tries to say she \"understands me\" even tho she doesn't \n\nBut last month she said, \"it's actually me who never let you socialize with other kids when you were in kindergarten and pre-K, because I was scared you would get hurt or sick\". \n\nYou see, I was born at 33 weeks and I got hydrocephalus as a baby. I was a very healthy kid otherwise, so much so that my parents managed to hide my medical history from me until i was 17 last year. So now she tried to tell me that she didn't WANT me to socialize with other kids - but I vividly remember her being frustrated at me when I struggled to socialize in elementary school. Or when I didn't want to do useless stuff such as school plays, or dancing on a stage back when I did ballet. She had beef with a literal child who needed support and comfort\n\nShe said SHE chose to isolate me from other kids when I was, let's say, 4 years old - but the moment I turned 5 or 6, she started putting the blame on me? Make it make sense. Not to mention she proudly tells people about the fact that she refused to let me see a professional about my social issues in kindergarten. Apparently she was \"traumatized\" because she spent too much time in hospitals when I was a baby, but.. how does that connect to her \"fear\" of MENTAL HEALTH professionals, exactly?? \n\nI like it when she criticizes herself for her choices and the way she raised me. For a few seconds, it makes it seem like she ACTUALLY wishes she'd been a better mom, but it's clear she believes I'm the problem. She's so inconsistent and volatile it used to really mess me up as a kid, but now it just makes me laugh.
