{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BPD", "title": "January Post (read before posting)", "text": "Hey guys! Happy New Year! This is a monthly announcement post to address the most commonly asked questions or issues faced in the subreddit. You can read the December announcement [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1pcc38x/december_post_read_before_posting/) to catch up on any important notes from last month. As always, If you need clarification on our rules or any of the items outlined here, please send us a modmail and we would be happy to help :)  \n\n\n1. **The Wiki has been updated!** The r/BPD Wiki has been updated to include an in-depth explanation of our rules and some of the most frequently asked questions here. If you have a question related to why your post was removed, please visit the Wiki before sending us a modmail in case the answer to your question is there! You can find a link to the Wiki through our Community Bookmarks sidebar or you can click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/wiki/index/) \n2. **We have recently modified our rules. Please review them!** As we update the subreddit we are actively reflecting on our rules and the language within them to help make sure we are communicating them to you as effectively as we can. If you’re confused about any recent changes or would like additional clarification, please [visit our Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/wiki/index/). If the answer isn’t in the Wiki, please feel free to reach out to the modteam through modmail! \n3. **At this time, we are implementing a 1 post per day limit.** We’ve been experiencing an influx in spam posts (ie., the same post being reposted several times over again in hopes it will bypass the automod filter or that more people will see it). At this time, we’ve implemented a 1 post per day rule to help fight back against the spam. If you need to make changes to a post, please edit the original post instead of deleting it and reposting it, as you will have to contact us via modmail then wait for a moderator to approve the new one. If you want to make two separate and unique posts, but you cannot wait 24 hours before posting the next one, please reach out to us via modmail. We appreciate your patience at this time as we test out this new system. \n4. **Posts with urgent calls to action, triggering content, or misleading titles will be removed.** We have noticed a recent trend for post titles to contain words like “URGENT” or “PLEASE HELP” or for the title to not match the content of the post, with the intent to grab readers attention in a misleading way. We’ve decided to begin removing these posts as the subreddit is not intended for urgent crisis support, it takes attention away from other members' posts, and we want to prevent karma farming. Please remember that minors can access Reddit, and post titles should not contain triggering content, though trigger warnings in the title are permitted and encouraged. \n5. **Posts about mania or feeling manic will be removed** **unless the user explicitly states that they have bipolar disorder**. Mania or feeling manic is NOT a symptom of BPD and to prevent the spread of misinformation, these posts will be removed. Discussing heightened emotions is permitted (ie., euphoria, ecstasy, joy) and it is recommended to avoid using the word manic altogether to prevent delays in your post getting approved. \n6. **Some content is too triggering for the subreddit.** Posts can mention traumatic events, but they should not contain graphic or detailed descriptions of them (ie., descriptions of violence, assault, overdose or medical trauma, abuse, etc.). We may remove posts with these descriptions as many subreddit members do not have the right therapeutic tools to help them process unexpected triggering content. If you need help identifying whether your post would be too triggering, please reach out to us. \n7. **Please remember we are just a small group of volunteers**. We greatly appreciate your patience as we work through the queue and our modmails during the busiest time of year. This is volunteer work for us, and so many of us are only able to help out here in our free time. Please remain respectful of the volunteers when reaching out for help with a post or comment, otherwise we will have to mute the modmails to protect our volunteers. \n8. **Why was my post removed immediately?** What's happening? Please read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1pxyfi6/why_was_my_post_removed/) for more info on why this sometimes happens and what to do.\n9. **Reporting is the most helpful thing you can do!** Anyone in the subreddit can help us by reporting posts. By reporting posts we will see things faster and can make the subreddit safer. Reports are completely anonymous, unless you wish to send us a modmail directly about a report.", "score": 9, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767314202.0, "id": "1q1k45v", "author": "skinkess", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1q1k45v/january_post_read_before_posting/"}

Such an obsessive preoccupation with the feelings of others is typical of psychologically abused children who in adulthood suffer the mercurial, intense emotional ups and downs that are sometimes diagnosed as ‘borderline personality disorder.’ Many such people are gifted at sensing what others around them are feeling, and it is quite common for them to report having suffered emotional abuse in childhood.”  \n\n**Goleman, D.

I know I'm not like other people. Sure other people have BPD and I relate to them more than normies. But I've never heard anyone speak about their feelings on a way that resembles what I go through. \n\nI'm in my 30s and have only been in love with 2 people. I spent 6 entire years thinking I was aromantic because the pain of heartbreak was too unbearable to fathom again. I would cry every night for well past the first year. Then it became every 2 days for a year. But 6 years in I couldn't go a week without something reminding me and sucking all of the life out of me. All for a relationship that was less than 1.5 years.\n\nThe only reason I even tried again was because... It was the same person I was still in love with that had broken up with me. 6 years later. \n\nI was meticulous about everything and put my all into it because I never expected in a million years I would get that chance. I knew it was unwise. But it didn't matter. I was joyful. And that was something I hadn't experienced in well... 6 years.\n\nI'm well aware this makes me far from the ideal partner. But honest to God I am always honest to the best of my ability because it wouldn't be fair to blindside someone with that if they were just looking for something casual. I'm perfectly capable of casual too. I wasn't entirely alone for 6 years. \n\nBut it's very hard for me to tow this line between being manipulative and being honest about my feelings. I know this is my burden to carry. And I would never hold it over someone's head. \n\nBut now they left me again. I'm sure most people will extrapolate that I must have some unreasonable behavior or something but even my ex would tell you they hadn't been honest about their feelings from the start. \n\nAll the progress I've made over 6 years  went up in smoke. I'm in absolute agony and it's been over 2 months. I would rather spend most of my waking life in a pot of scalding water than feel like this.\n\nI honestly don't want to die. I was just starting to feel alive. But I simply am not capable of handling this like a normal person. I've tried. But all the advice I get I feel like the person doesn't understand what I feel like.

I have an alcohol tester but I'm always too scared to ask him to use it bcs he tends to crash out on me and it scares me to death. I'm starting to notice that I cannot tell the difference anymore. He always seems weird to me. My thinking process is so messed up, anyone who speaks a little louder or acts in a joking matter triggers me to an uncomftable level. I'm not sure what to do. Whenever I try to talk to my family they always brush it off because all our problems are already the norm to them but I seriously cannot handle it any longer. \n\nSometimes I'm disappointed and I hold back from crying, the other I get so mad I think about fighting him.

She is very lucky to have you and you should be happy yourself that you ended up with her. Just so you know, us with BPD are not monsters, despite the stigma that I am sure you know about. We love just as hard as anyone else. We just feel everything (mainly emotion wise) so much more than the average person, it hurts us physically. Despite that, my biggest piece of advice is you need to give her reassurance. She will likely ask for it (if she hasn’t already). You two need to establish clear boundaries. Not only for yourself, but her as well. I am going to be completely honest with you, it’s not going to be easy and it’s not going to be pretty.

It’s a never ending battle in our minds. Biggest thing for you, take care of yourself and if she does “split” and have episodes, don’t take it personally.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "You will likely experience being split on, if you haven't already. It will be cruel. It will be ugly. It will feel like the most personal attack in your life and leave you feeling hollow inside. You'll probably feel unsafe and want to distance yourself.\n\nI think saying that they don't mean it is the wrong way to think about it. They mean it in the moment. Sometimes they won't apologies for what has been said. They will feel guilt though. You need to understand that when it is happening, it's an intense emotional reaction that they just need to get out. It could be because they're feeling bad about themselves for something but it needs to be externalised. Some people have almost described it like blacking out and the thoughts just flow out.\n\nIf you are unable to find a method around this, this will likely be the main breaking point of the relationship. Every person is an individual and there is no one method fits all - believe me, if there was *everyone* here would be saying it. All they're really wanting is reassurance. That you still love them; that you're not going to leave. Some people tell them this and it can pull them out of it. Some people try to say this and all is does is make them more angry because in the moment it feels like a lie. Some people embrace their partner and it will calm them. For others, it will anger them more. Sometimes they just need space (with reassurance). That could either mean yourself or the partner leaving the room (but do not mistake this with using their fear of abandonment against them - that is manipulation). Reassure them that you still love them and that you're leaving this moment, but not leaving them forever.\n\nIt's up to you and your partner to discuss what they ***and you*** need. Do not just take the abuse, if it gets to that. Cause is not an excuse for the action. You need to protect yourself first. If you let it get to you, it will turn into silent resentment. You will likely get confused at times if things don't make sense. They probably won't be able to explain it cleanly to you either, especially in the moment. When they're drowning in emotion, you can't expect them to be able to teach you how to swim.\n\n**People with BPD do not mean to act this way.** They do not wake up with the intent to hurt anyone. Under it all, they have likely experienced a traumatic life and this is how it how manifested into their lives. They want what everyone else does: to feel loved and wanted. Their feelings are just multiplied by 100. Which is why love feels so intoxicating, and hurt or hate feels world ending. Do not punish them for feeling how they feel. Listen to what they're saying. Truly listen. They'll usually give you the answer you need to know, you just might have to figure it out a little.\n\n**Be patient**. Cannot express that enough. If they split black on you, please don't yell back. They don't mean it and trying to argue back will get nobody anywhere. If you start to get caught up in yor own emotions, just walk away, or breathe. Never fuel the fire. You'll only regret how you acted afterwards. It's not wrong for *you* to feel upset at what they're saying. Just accomplishes nothing expressing it in emotion. That said, they shouldn't be able to just say anything they like without accountability.\n\n**Boundaries**. Good lord. Make them and keep them. You need to be consistent. Bottom line. If you say you're going to do *or not do* something, hold to it. Just because they have this condition doesn't mean anything goes. This stuff should be discussed during a time of stability. What is and isn't okay; for both of you. Your love may be unconditional, but access to that love sure isn't.\n\n**Reassurance looks different for everybody.** One compliment a day looks fine to me, but to someone else that might be nowhere near enough. You need to have clear conversations about this. Nobody is a mind reader. What does love look like to you? What does it look like to them? There's no *one-size-fit-all* method for showing love. If either of you is feeling less than what you need, make that known. Generally (from reading many peoples expressions here) BPD partners need a LOT of reassurance because their mind will tell them they are not enough. That's more something that shouldbe dealt with in therapy, but it doesn't hurt to remind them of your love.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768016110.0, "id": "nyq4olr", "author": "Nurolight"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "Hey. First of all, short answer is yes. The longer answer is suicide and ideation is misunderstood and taboo to discuss, which is bad because it affects so very many people. This is my framing to better understand how it exists in my own life. \n\nThere is a large space between the feeling I have regularly of not wanting to live (like this) and wanting to actually die. They are not the same and it’s murky and messy, but a very important distinction that can lead to real problems for us because others can feel a need for intervention that is inappropriate based on their fear, or dismiss us because it feels manipulative to them. \n\nI wake up in the morning and wish I didn’t frequently enough that it is normal. I find comfort in the SI at times because it seems like a simple solutik to stop the unbearable pain I feel at times that nobody seems to understand unless I cry out in pain and share the extent of it, that I’d rather die than feel this way. But what I want is a witness, and for that witness to understand how very overwhelming that pain is. There are no words for that a “normal” person will really relate to. I know you and others here reading this do understand it instantly. But most don’t. And they have been trained that any talk of it is an emergency that requires big messy action that for us, often is counter productive. There is no medication we have been lacking that they can top up for us to end it. There is no fix for it in the emergency room. The police treat us like criminals because that’s their training. The emergency staff often treat us with efficiency that leaves us in worse shape and even less regulated and now we have ruptured a relationship and lost a former support we had trusted. We now know to keep it to ourselves and that means we may get closer to the side of the space I mentioned that is wanting to die. \n\n\nAnyway, yeah. I do.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BPD", "title": "Potential BPD misdiagnosis? Unsure about next steps", "text": "Hello!\n\nI’m a 24-year-old trans woman living in Canada. I have been diagnosed with BPD last year and went through an intensive DBT program. I’m definitely doing much better now after a few months of treatment. However, I have a lingering sense that the diagnosis was a mistake — that the BPD-like symptoms are not part of my personality. Now I’m not sure what to do about it.\n\nFor context: I was a victim of an SA-ish experience when I was a child. I grew up in an Asian Christian household, where talk of anything like that was very much a no-no, and so I felt like I was “sinful being” for a long time. My parents often had high expectations of me. I was never into particularly boy-ish things (but also wasn’t super great at making girl friends either — I just did my own things as a kid usually) and wished that I was born as a daughter for as long as I can remember. Yet, they expected me an obedient boy/man who follows what a good, hard-working Christian boy must do. For instance, I would wash my face with cleanser after sweating or put on facial sunscreen and my dad would scold me for being too girly. Same thing for crying ever. Needless to say, there was basically zero room to explore my gender identity or even other things my parents didn’t approve of.\n\nI was lucky to live away from them during university, but I still financially depended on them and hence couldn’t really challenge their expectations out of the fear of abandonment that had real-life consequences. They expected me to get married to a Korean Christian wife, have a stable and respectable job, and have a couple of kids. And I remember often having lots of back-and-forth moments in my identity: one side that is my true self who has very different wants and needs, and the other that is what my parents want me to be.\n\nDespite having graduated, come to terms with my SA trauma, and began my gender transition a few months ago (at the point of my diagnosis), I still had issues with identity and mood fluctuations, which is why I went to the psychologist and got diagnosed BPD. However, after seeing drastic positive changes from reducing contact with my parents and living fully with only my true identity in the past few months, now I’m beginning to challenge it more and more. I’ll list the 9 diagnostic criteria here:\n\n1. Impulsiveness: Maybe somewhat, but I was always known as a kid with a lot of patience, and if anything, my problem is often that I stick with things for too long.\n2. Mood instability: I suspect gender dysphoria, trauma response from SA and balancing the double identity (me vs. parents), and plain old anxiety/depression could explain this.\n3. Dissociation: Nope, absolutely nothing like that. I’m always present in the moment even when I’m distressed.\n4. Unstable identity/self-image: Yes I did have this problem. But after drastically reducing contact with my parents over time, I have zero issues with it. I just… get a sense of finally, truly being sure of who I was all along in so many aspects of my identity.\n5. Intense relationships: Looking back, I feel this was sooooo driven by the conflict between my wants/needs and parental expectations. My first romantic relationship was with a South Asian Hindu person, and I remember having intense back-and-forth within about “I love them. But my parents will never approve of this. So I should break up now. No, that makes no sense — I still want to be with them. So I’ll just run away. No, that’s too extreme…” Now I feel way more stable in my relationships and feel I can be myself independent of my relationship with others.\n6. Suicidal gestures: This has indeed been an issue in the past, but it also has not really happened (at least nowhere near intense) since reducing ties with my parents.\n7. Anger outbursts: Also nope, if anything people called me as being too soft. Anger was very often self-directed from not being able to be a “good son” and meet expectations of my parents.\n8. Fear of abandonment: After becoming financially independent from my parents and putting a stop to the double-identity life, I feel this is much less of a problem. Sure I worry if people don’t like me and leave me time to time. But it’s not something I feel detrimentally affects any of my relationships now.\n9. Sense of emptiness: I felt this for a long time before, but after working hard to affirm who I truly am in therapy, I’m confident that I really don’t feel this anymore. In fact, I’m kind of amazed how much I’ve changed in this aspect in such short period of time (few months of therapy).\n\nThe issue is, I don’t even know if this truly is a misdiagnosis or I’m simply misinterpreting improvements from therapy as a genuine invalidation of the previous symptom interpretation. And who do I even ask about any of this? The diagnosing psychologist, my therapist, a doctor, or someone else? Is it even possible to challenge a diagnosis like this, especially if it’s only been just over half a year?\n\nI’m lost in all of this, and I’d love to hear insights any of you have.

It’s painful seeing her suffer again and again because of this. \n\nShe is in remission with most of her BPD symptoms now (according to her therapist!) since she has done years of DBT. She is still struggling with depression though which is manageable with her medication most of the time.\n\nShe said she didn’t \"earn\" finding a good partner yet \"despite being in remission\".\nShe keeps looking up very stigmatizing forum posts about how relationships with people like her are going to fail either way and how men wouldn’t date someone like her. \n\nIt breaks my heart somehow.

TW for this part:\n\nI’ll be honest with you. In my opinion she wasn’t even the only one responsible for her last relationship to fail. Her unmanaged BPD was challenging back then and I am not denying that BUT her ex also threatened her a lot and said a lot of really nasty things to her even with me being present. I’m talking about stuff like \"I’ll eventually off you if you do / don’t do XY\" , SA threats, etc.\nShe said that her BPD made him act that way so it’s her fault.

Male loneliness epidemic, I'm sure you've heard the turn of phrase. We're fetishized because of our vulnerability and how much we give and how much we'll take. I feel like the manic pixie dream girl thing is a stereotyped fetishized version of us.\n\nI am diagnosed bpd and I am in a relationship of 2+ years now, after having been in a very abusive situation previously for 5. I'm not going to say my relationship is easy. I've seen the ugliest side of myself in it. I've done what my abusers have done to me in episodes, things I never thought myself capable of doing. I feel like a monster sometimes and when I shame spiral over it (every single time) I can get suicidal still. Self harm still happens.\n\nBut, here's the thing: my bpd would have been in remission (less fear of abandonment) or at least better masked if I had stayed single. Do you want to know why? Because now you have to put into practice everything you learned/are learning in therapy. The moment you finally feel safe, everything falls apart. It gets worse before it gets better because you have someone there triggering you to help you process things you haven't yet. The stuff you hide from yourself and other people. The stuff you can't deny when the monster shows its face, because the monster shows its face when it is deeply wounded.\n\nI was put on the depo shot shortly after we moved in together and things got really bad. Months are a blur of rage for me, so much trauma for him. It takes a kind, patient, STRONG, and intelligent partner to go through this with you. Not everyone is resilient enough, and sometimes that's okay. Sometimes you can't take things back, but you will take with you the things you've learned. Successful bpd relationships require experience and commitment and trust and therapy. I require medication and therapy still but where I stand now is 1000% better than where I was when we started 2 years ago\n\nBasically, it's a choice of whether or not she wants to do the work for love. If she's not ready to face all of that, then she's not ready for that. Please show this to her for me, or reiterate some of this when you talk to her. You are deserving of love, if you want it. Everyone deserves love. If all of us had grown up with more love, we'd know that it's not about whether or not we're worthy. We make mistakes, we hurt people, it's your choice whether or not to learn from those mistakes and try to hurt people less. Think of someone else out there, feeling the same way but yearning for connection. Would you want that person to suffer? Or would you want that person to have a chance to be better? We can get stuck or we can get better, and getting better isn't a linear journey. It's a very rocky one... That will one day get less rocky, as two people come together and truly come to know one another.

During the time period when my life feels like it isn't mine, I am more likely to be more militant and strict about my own desires and ambitions and am more likely to go against the other things inside of me.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, after 3 months I still think that the falling out was a good idea, but I am also kinda regretting it in a way? Like I catch myself thinking: \"Maybe that was cruel to that thing in me. Maybe I should have just tried harder and accepted that this life isn't just mine.\" And then I think \"Oh my god, is that a split? Am I thinking that just because I have BPD?\" and I'm really worried about that. I'm really worried about being irrational and volatile in this regard.\n\nFor the record I don't think there's anything I could do to undo the falling out even if I somehow decided that it was actually a bad idea, which, again, I don't think that. I'm just starting to feel guilty about it (I didn't do anything to said friend, we just met up, I went \"Hey I don't think this is working and I'm sorry for entering this friendship in the first place, I don't know why I did that. Regardless of that it is making me function badly and I think it needs to end.\" and he went \"Sure, that's fine, I don't really care because I can just turn all the feelings I have for someone off. No biggie.\"; I'm more guilty about doing that to that thing in me because while I didn't really care about the relationship I know that something in me did?).\n\nBut yeah basically I'm worried that this change of opinion and feelings after just 3 months is very BPD of me?

It feels like I’m cursed, like it’s a looming feeling that I’ll never be able to actually end up happy with someone.

I have no idea how to relax when I’m alone or just at home with my husband. I literally scream the most insane words from morning to night to try to get the bad thoughts out of my head.  \n\n\nMeanwhile, I try so hard to appear normal and unproblematic to friends and acquaintances. I would rather disappear from existence than annoy or freak them out with how intense and anxious I am. \n\nI just got a glowing performance review at work yesterday, but my boss has no idea that every day I go into the office, I feel so exhausted from trying not to show how many small interactions make me feel hurt or excluded, or worried that I hurt or excluded someone else.\n\nIt SUCKS.

It’s 100% on us for reacting.\n\nI try so hard to manage my emotions and hold myself accountable, but when I do have a meltdown, I get little to no compassion even from my husband.

I think what I’m trying to say is, it sucks to be working overtime to not hurt, overwhelm, or stress out other people, even when you genuinely feel terrified all the time.

I explained to him it’s more like two primary fears that consume me daily. Fear of abandonment, and fear of betrayal. The thing that eats away at me the most is the fear of betrayal. I guess that just stems from when it has happened to you twice so far. Before I say anything else, to those who can relate, I wish you never went through such a thing. I know how it can distort your mind and make it nearly impossible to trust anyone ever again. I feel for anyone who has been through it. The point I am trying to make is, after my session today, I have been sitting with the thought of betrayal and just accepting it for what it is. I am slowly realizing, it was not my fault, no matter how much I was blamed for someone else’s choice. Again I say choice. People who say it was a mistake or it was the right thing to do are fucking stupid. It doesn’t matter. There’s no excuse to cheat, period. The cheater is the fool and so is the one who is also in on the betrayal, and is well aware this person is still in a relationship. A cheater is also a fool for pursuing someone and makes them believe/convinces them they are in fact single. I guess cheaters don’t realize they’re not just ruining themselves, they’re ruining the one who genuinely loved them. The one who is in on it, let alone encourages it is also ruining themselves whether they think so or not. The one who is reeled in and is convinced they are with someone who is single will only end up heartbroken. I simply don’t get it. Yet, I just accept it was never my fault and if it happens again, it is what it is. To everyone else who has experienced this, it’s not your fault. You are meant to be loved.

she thinks i’m seeing people too but god i wish i was, it would be so much bearable if i had other people around me to talk to. cus she’s my best friend and lover in one. i keep holding on to that deal about talking again in may because she was so sweet before and i just miss that part of her. she said she will really try to change \n\ntoday she texted me on the bus home. we hadn’t talked for over a day but then she had to go. tldr: she texted me as she was getting off the bus. i get confused why she didn’t text me earlier. i realized she was texting that girl. i split and get mad. she tells me to chill. i get more mad and she says let’s be done fr. i ask her why, she says she’s not my person. i keep asking why. she says she doesn’t want to be with me, not gonna work out, i need someone else, can’t handle me, etc. i cried and begged her not to leave me and said i wouldn’t talk to her until may and i’ll change i’ll try i’ll do what she wants, just don’t leave me. she said okay let’s try in the summer. i ended up apologising to her for my behaviour.\n\ni tried to kms a week ago cus she did the same thing. she was texting her at the same time and i split again. then she left in the middle again to text her back, despite knowing i was going to attempt :/\n\ni started self-harming because of her. so i do resent her for all these scars i have on my body. the past few years were painful but they weren’t this bad. i know everyone is gonna tell me to leave her and i know it’ll be better for me if i do, but i can’t. cus then why did i go through all of this just to not even end up with her. like why did i have hurt myself and have all these scars and become so miserable. why did i have to go through so much pain if we weren’t going to end up together. she’s the only person who knows me. she was my best friend and the person i loved most in the world. i don’t know how to leave her. it’s not fair that she gets to inflict all this pain on me and then leave me and live her life. it’s not fair. i don’t want to leave because i feel like i won’t find anyone else that will love me. then i want to stay to hurt myself. then sometimes i want to leave because she deserves better than me. there’s so many conflicting thoughts and i don’t know what to think. i don’t know what to do. it makes me go insane like am i being too much, am i asking for too much?

It's so overwhelming and stressful. Like I feel everything to the max, and nothing to the max. I don't even know how to even begin to TRY to cope with these episodes with something that isn't weed. But, because of the intensity I just physically/mentally cannot even begin to cope with every emotion at once. But then because of that, no matter how hard I tell myself they will, each emotion feels like another version of me in my head that I have to take care of, each version gets increasingly upset when I try to take it one emotion at a time and every part of me is screaming at the main part of me. And no matter how hard I try to tell myself I'll get to that emotion, that one freaks out even more bc everyone needs everything. \n\nThis has gone on for years. For years, nothing has ever helped these episodes besides weed or some kind of medication. And I'm chosing weed because I have a history of prescription drug abuse, specifically anxiety medication, so I refuse to go back on any medication for anxiety, and honestly my doctors probably wouldn't even prescribe anything like that either. So all I have is weed to get me through these episodes bc then when I smoke, every single emotion calms down, then I can get to them and cope with them. \n\nHowever I don't wanna keep relying on weed for these episodes, but no matter what I do the more I try to cope with the emotions, the more every other one doesn't feel listened to then it becomes a whole fucking spiral \nI dont even care about tips for this (which I will greatly appreciate anyway) I just want some fucking comfort.

My best friend is my FP, and honestly, I feel like my life revolves around her. When something happens with her, even small things, I crash completely. My emotions go nuclear and I can’t stop obsessing.\n\nFor example, today they were on a call with someone else just a two-hour call. Logically, I know it’s fine. They’re allowed to talk to people. But emotionally? I felt like the world was ending. I got jealous, panicky, and my brain kept spinning. That's OUR thing like we call till late in the night.I think stuff like : “Why aren’t they talking to me? Am I not enough? What if they like them more than me?” My chest tightened, my stomach sank, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I had a complete melt down\n\nOr when something goes slightly wrong between us, I misread a message, they don’t respond immediately, I spiral. I get this deep, sinking feeling that my whole world is collapsing, like everything that matters is slipping away. \n\nI am always checking if she's online, her reposts like a crazy person. I can't express how insane this feels. I plan my whole life around her. I logically know i'm being unreasonable but I physically can't stop. I get so jealous when she's talking to other people especially her other good friend. I see her as competition. I hate the idea that they're talking because wtfdym you talk to others when i'm here? \n\nEven when we’re fine, I’m exhausted. My mind constantly loops through scenarios: “Did I do something wrong? Did they like what I said? Are they going to leave me?” I know it sounds extreme, but I can’t help it.\n\nI’ve tried framing this as attachment issues, anxiety, panic disorder, or depression in the past but when i got diagnosed with bpd everything finally clicked.\n\nI just want advice on coping. How do people manage when an FP dominates their entire emotional life? How do you stop yourself from crashing, obsessing, or feeling like everything is falling apart whenever something happens with them? I feel trapped in my own head, and I don’t know how to handle it anymore. Nothing has helped me exept constant reassurance from her.\n\nThanks for reading.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "You are not a bad person and neither is she. You both have challenges and likely trauma you carry that is being activated repeatedly in cycles. The only purpose of weighing blame would be to determine if each or either of you is willing to work on the dynamic in a respectful and accountable way. To me this means taking time to understand each other which is difficult when we don’t understand ourselves very easily and knowing that you are not giving too much of yourself to be able to provide the grace and space for mistakes along the way. If that’s not the case it isn’t a value judgement on either one of you. Without this commitment there is not a lot of hope other than push/pull rupture/reconnect that lasts until the damage makes the above forgone. \n\nI will give you one piece of perspective from her side, which is we experience rapid mood shifts and they are usually cyclical and they can be triggered or just happen. The way we feel when we are full of love and light and not encumbered by the weight of the darkness and self abuse we experience is the real us. I’m sure of it. The way we are when we split is a fear response and maladaptive coping that we have learned long ago and yet to replace. They are awful instruments that are designed to protect us from a pain we have experience before and are terrified of. They don’t work but they have got us this far. We don’t want to be that way. Why would we choose it? Our agency lies in the ability to do very intense and honest  self reflection, trauma informed work to help our deep wounds and technical work to replace the bad tools we have. That seems simple but it isn’t and also requires us to be in a place where we are ready. \n\nThe behavior seems like it is driven by malice and that is something we have been told and even believe ourselves until we learn better, and still believe when we are vulnerable or dealing with shame and disappointment in the harm we have caused. But it isn’t. That’s why it’s confusing to others and ourselves that we switch so drastically. We must want to do it. Otherwise why would we? But one more question reveals the contradiction. Why would anyone want to harm their loved ones and set their relationships on fire? \n\nThe moods changes of BPD get overlooked a lot but I think they cause a lot of misunderstanding. When we are feeling awful and cry out in pain or talk about wanting to be done it is often followed by clarity and understanding and yet we have dragged someone else into that turmoil and now suddenly after they are affected we seem improved. Seems like we are manipulating out here and taking pleasure or comfort in their pain. It’s circumstantial. I just recently figured this out myself. \n\nThe question for you is if you can remove yourself from the way it seems, so very personal and downright mean, and what it is, a overwhelming fear response that takes our executive function offline and has us flooded with panic hormones demanding fight or flight. This is assuming she is aware of and working toward managing this so it doesn’t continue untreated. \n\nThere are steps you both can take to make this relationship safer and even more valuable than it is. It’s messy work. It’s not an obligation. You will not be a bad person if you can’t or even if you just don’t wish to. \n\nIf you do a great resource for understanding BPD behavior for friends and loved ones is Dr. Daniel Fox on YouTube. He’s honest and keeps dignity for all involved which is not usual in this world that misunderstands us so much more than doesn’t. \n\nI think you are a great friend and person for even being concerned and seeking answers.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "Does that really happen because of splitting? I took OP to mean they enjoy their behavior when they split, rather than what you’re talking about. \n\nFor example, if I’m invested, I am way too scared to “test”, and won’t do it or play any games whatsoever. This doesn’t make me better or more advanced than anyone else. I’ve just been too scared. Even now, it doesn’t make sense to start though I’m becoming less and less disorganized attached. \n\nIf I split towards someone else, it means I’ve been horribly abused, likely for years continuously and undeniably, maybe even assaulted, *plus* abandoned. That’s when I act like this. 98% of the time I only split on myself. Some call this reactive abuse, and I saw some people on a hate-other-cluster-bs place saying that it doesn’t even count as abuse, but I don’t agree. If it’s come down to this, yes, I outdo what the other person did; it’s how I survived. \n\nAnd there are a lot of people upset and discussing their progress. If it’s genuine and they haven’t just been fortunate enough to not be triggered at the right scale again, I’m happy for them. \n\nBut there are people like me, who know it’s not a matter of “I’m just too old for that now.” This is real mental illness and the severity scales are individualized to us all, through all stages of life. For myself, I did my DBT and EMDR. I wanted to do more of each as well as IFS, maybe mentalization and others. But my life has been too unstable to be able to stick with it long enough to have gone into remission. The best I can do is now, I observe and recognize a split towards myself without, and use skills to avoid it on others.

Well I sure as hell wouldn’t want someone to lie to me if I did something wrong socially or I smelt bad or whatever, anyway they struggle with severe self esteem issues and the slightest thing makes them feel as if they are the lowest being of all time and they had asked me if their breath smelt. Natrually I told the truth, yes yes it did. And I’m very sensitive to smell and this isn’t just like bad breathe it’s like really bad gets on my nose and annoys me but of course at the time I didn’t say anything because its rude right but since they asked I thought yeah were friends I should tell the truth.. well boy was I wrong it sent them into a spiral and I felt so bad, of course the right thing to do would be to apologise but my dumbass just kept pushing it like the idiot I am and was like yeah there are other things you do that’s wrong but it doesn’t matter- yep definitely a bad ass thing to say as they then persisted for me to tell them- being socially unaware they rely on me and others to persevere them for themselves- so of course I told them yeah you do this sometimes and this other times I find it annoying but it’s fine really. This just made it worse- I should have realised at this point hey your sending them into a spiral stop but sometimes I get carried away and push shit which again I know is wrong of me. Either way I tried to make it better but I just kept making it worse and in the end they decided to cancel all of our future plans and ghost me, now I’m not hurt by this I’m just fed up with myself and feeling really bad and also- at a time like this I personally believe this is a BAD time for them to drop all our plans… the thing is idk how to get them to respond to me- do I just leave them? Do I push them to go on with our plans? Show up at their house?

Everytime she would push away it would hurt so much, and when she pulled me back in it felt like everything was fine until she pushed me away because she told me she was scared to get close and so it started a push pull dynamic she would avoid me for hours and then message me telling me how much she’d misses and she would get me gifts and we would talk about the whole push pull dynamic.\n\nI was hurting a lot and just wanted to understand what she wanted if it was to leave me or be with me so I asked her to make a decision because the pain is hurting me a lot whether to stay with me or leave me. It took her days but eventually she said it’s best if she leaves because she can’t stay warm all the time and blocked me, i woke up that morning and saw the text my heart sank but I didn’t immediately feel anything I felt too shocked to feel anything and for a couple of days I felt shocked too stunned to even process anything.\n\nAnd to make things worse my parents asked me to go on vacation with them to a different state and so once we got there they revealed that the house were staying at is officially ours and that were moving here for a couple of month. Rather than making me happy it broke me down because all I could do is think about my fp, my mom ended up going back to the state we used to live in for business and my dad is here with me, he’s the only person here with me and he’s hardly home so I feel beyond lonely im in a different state &amp; city that I have no prior knowledge about other than visiting for vacations im alone with no one, and im losing my mind.\n\nA couple of days ago I felt intensity and I got extremely impulsive in contacting her and I decided to message her friends and even a family member of hers trying to get in contact with her and at the time nothing was going to stop me till she responded and so I went on a spree contacting her friends asking if my fp could unblock me and talk to me. I didn’t think about the consequences of anything or how I was wrong for contacting her friends &amp; family member. I just felt the need to talk to her even if it was for a singular second I was willing to do anything to give up anything. Almost everyone i contacted blocked me and ignored me which rightfully so, except her friend who was kind enough to ask me not to contact my fp’s friends and told me it’s best if I leave my fp alone and wished me the best of luck. And so that calmed me down, and I stopped and I unsent all the messages I sent out and accepted it’s over but it hurts so bad it hurts so much, the pain is unbearable even in my dreams I feel the hurt. Every single thought is about her and I keep imagining scenarios of me and her talking in the future. I’m in so much pain I just don’t know what to do I have no one to talk to, my friends don’t understand what BPD is and simply tell me it’s going to be okay and to get over it.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BPD", "title": "Your person exists", "text": "I’ve (30F) been diagnosed with BPD for about three years now, but I’ve been living with it for close to 20 years. I turned 30 in December and this whole past year I’ve struggled with accepting that because I truly felt like as soon as I hit that milestone that my value started dropping immediately. I have never been in a long term relationship, I’ve never truly been in love or had someone love ME (some people have “loved” other versions of me, the versions of me that I unknowingly created or faked to be accepted), and I’ve started to accept this year that I will never find the man of my dreams. I accepted that even though I am learning that I am worth more than just sex or casual situationships, that no one else really felt the same and I was destined to be alone physically or emotionally forever.\n\nThen in October I met him. I went back on dating apps because I was (once again) lonely and yearning to love and be loved. His smile drew me in instantly and I felt the warmth from it right away. We started talking and I started falling. It hasn’t been “easy”- parts of my past gave him anxiety and fear that I would deceive him and take advantage of him the way his previous relationships had. We have had a lot of deep, difficult conversations where I cried the whole time because I’ve never had these conversations with someone before where they didn’t end in me being abandoned or judged or belittled or yelled at. But he is different than the people I’ve faced in my past. \n\nHe is understanding, he is nonjudgmental, he is emotionally stable and intelligent, he has a strong need to communicate openly and honestly, and he is patient. He has made me learn how to have these conversations without fearing abandonment, without fearing anger or malicious confrontation, without feeling like I need to lie or hide parts of myself just so I can keep him. I dreamt and fantasized and imagined a relationship where I could feel comfortable being myself without reparations, where I could give my full heart and soul and love to someone without fearing they’d take advantage of it, where I could finally be treated the way I’ve learned I deserve to be treated, and where I could love and be loved in such a raw, instinctual, beautiful way. I thought I was broken for years, I thought I’d never be normal and I’d never have a chance at true love. \n\nThankfully, I was wrong.\n\nHe shows me in his words and his actions that he cares about me as a person (not as a sexual object), he shows me I am worthy of true love and adoration and respect and understanding, he shows me that I can speak my mind and my opinions and not worry about being judged or berated for them, he shows me that I do have a truly good soul and that I am worth the time and effort it takes to work with my BPD and make me learn healthier pathways in life. I never thought I’d find a man like him. I thought I’d dreamed up an unrealistic expectation of a man and that I’d have to settle no matter what (if I was lucky enough to even build a bond with someone). He shows me every day that I was wrong. His existence and his personality and his soul and mind and heart show me that this ideal person CAN and DOES exist. He shows me that I can love and be loved the way I’ve always dreamed of. He proves that people who genuinely understand, who WANT to learn more about us with BPD and WANT to help us continue our path of healing DO exist. That it is possible to find someone who wants to learn your fears and your anxieties so they can actively work to show you true understanding and help you conquer them.\n\nI never thought I’d find my forever person and I certainly never thought that they’d truly love and want me the same way I love and want them. Part of me is still so terrified that he could leave me at the drop of a hat. But his soul is so beautiful and his reassurance and actions show me that he WILL listen, he WILL try to understand my warped point of view, he WILL fight and put in effort to keep me. I still don’t believe sometimes that this is real. That he is real. But he is. And I know that if I, a warped, twisted, jagged, broken puzzle piece, can find the other piece that somehow fits into mine so easily, that you can too. \n\nIf you keep working on learning and growing, and don’t give up hope that you’re worth knowing and loving, you too can find your true forever person and you can find the peace that we all deserve. You will find the person who gives you the patience and understanding and support you need to help you unlearn those maladaptive coping mechanisms you’ve grown to become attached to. They exist. You are worthy of that love.

I’m (26f) posting because I’m having a hard time separating my emotions from reality, and I’d really appreciate perspective from people who live with BPD.\n\nI have BPD and strong rejection sensitivity. I’m in therapy + SSRI + mood stabilizers for years. I’ve been working a lot on not being emotionally overwhelming, controlling, or demanding in relationships.\n\nSo, I’ve been going out with this guy (26M) for 6 months, we’re both non monogamous with our separate partners and the relationships are very good. But something happened this week\n\nI asked him out for a movie on Friday, he said he has plans with his girlfriend and suggested the movie on Thursday. Then, when I tried to schedule the time on Thursday he said that he wasn’t in the mood for going out and socializing and asked to postpone our date for next week. \n\nLogically, I understand that energy isn’t equal across situations. But emotionally, my brain immediately translated that into:\n\n“Being with me takes more effort. I’m not worth it.”\n\nThat thought hit really deep. I became very self-critical and started questioning my value instead of just sitting with the disappointment.\n\nI eventually told him (carefully) that I felt sad, making sure not to accuse or pressure him. He responded kindly and reassured me that he likes spending time with me and doesn’t see me as a burden.\n\nAfter that, he asked if I’d be free next week. And this is where I got confused:\n\nI suddenly felt completely turned off from going.\n\nNot because I don’t like him, but because the invitation no longer felt clean. It felt tied to guilt, repair, or obligation and with BPD, that makes me feel unsafe and small.\n\nNow I’m wondering:\n\n\t•\tIs this loss of desire a healthy boundary or emotional shutdown?\n\n\t•\tHow do you stop your brain from turning “they’re tired” into “I’m not enough”?\n\n\t•\tHow do you express sadness without feeling manipulative afterward?\n\n\t•\tWhen you feel like you were second choice, how do you self-regulate without self-abandoning?\n\nI’m not trying to villainize anyone.

It's not a boundary because other people not wanting to do something isn't in our control. \n\n2 my best answer is affirmations.

It's all something i never experienced. \n\nAnd since she's my fp, i of course get crazily jealous and upset when she treats someone well.

I became antisocial because no one wanted to play anymore; they were all behaving like adults, talking about girlfriends and boyfriends. I thought having a girlfriend was the coolest thing to happen to a guy, so I made it my mission to reach that goal. I also felt so overprotected by mom that i started to detach emotionally from her.  I didn't realize it was going to ruin me permanently.\n\n I've been in too many relationships and situationships where everything ended in trauma, guilt, and shame. I wanted to be a hero or an angel to broken people, and I ended up with my wings being ripped apart by people who abused and manipulated me. Every year that passed, it became heavier in the heart, because I realized I could've stopped most of the abuses, but I didn't want to end up alone, so I endured everything and everyone. Now, none of those people are in my life anymore, and I still carry all that pain in my heart. I remember my last relationship from a year ago; she treated me like a king, like some sort of god. She just treated me so nicely, and that felt like heaven. Only to be crushed months later because she didn't know what she wanted. She forced herself to feel something for me. Something that took me too long to realize.\n\nThen I met someone, someone who treated me so nicely and so sweetly and had BPD like me. Someone who could really understand me. And the irony of life attacked. I realized I didn't have feelings for her because she reminded me of myself and my mother, so I pushed her away. I lied to her and hurt her, and it hurt me that I did because I know exactly how she feels. It makes me so mad that I didn't love her, that I didn't like her, but in a fucked up way, I still think of the girl who hurt me a lot, I still want that false love. \n\nThe reason why I love poetry is that I try my best to find an explanation to how exactly I feel, or to write how i feel, but maybe I'm not that formal or have the wide range of words, because i keep struggling to find meaning to all of this. I still yearn for love, I still want the \"one\" when I know she doesnt exist. It's in me, I'm supposed to be the love of my life. But how can I do that if I feel anger and hate towards myself?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BPD", "title": "Need advice", "text": "Hi guys I have kind of a weird question. I’m honestly not sure if this has anything to do with my BPD or if it’s more tied to my PTSD, or if it’s a combination of the two. \n\nAnyways - first things first I love my boyfriend. He’s great, and dating him the pros far outweigh the cons. He struggles with mental health as well but I don’t want to spread his personal issues all over the internet. The only thing that matters contextually is that he really struggles with depression, for months at a time (a good 2/3 of the year i would say he is severely depressed). I love him, and will always support him, and normally his depression does not impact our relationship except when in comes to sex. \n\nObviously, his libido drops when he’s depressed. It’s normal, and I expect it. So the reason I’m on here is because this has began to happen again, but I’ve noticed it has actually began to adversely impact \\*my\\* libido this time and I’m worried it’s going to affect our relationship overall. \n\nSo, normally when he’s depressed he still wants me to try and initiate, so for about a month I tried to initiate one or two times a week and he wasn’t interested at all. That’s fine, I never want him to feel like he \\*has\\* to have sex, but I’ve started to feel less comfortable initiating the more he says no. The way he likes me to initiate is by being physical with him, and then he decides whether or not he wants to keep going; but lately I feel kind of gross trying to initiate because I’m already anticipating a no, and it feels like I’m being creepy or something. This has in turn made me not want to initiate at all, and made my sex drive drop a ton, to the point where when I even \\*thought\\* about trying to initiate last night it actually made me physically sick. \n\nI haven’t felt that way thinking about sex in a long time; since right before/after my boyfriend and I got together. About a year before I met him and we started dating I was drugged and SAd, and have been struggling with sex and intimacy ever since, but it got a lot easier with him. I’m really worried that I’m going to have to re-do a lot of the work I did to feel comfortable and enjoy sex again. \n\nI’m really at a loss of what to do here. Obviously I’m not going to tell my boyfriend to suck it up and have sex more or whatever, so do I just need to accept that I might have to go through the uncomfortable phase of sex again?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767988749.0, "id": "1q8ijv6", "author": "Expert-Associate-451", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1q8ijv6/need_advice/"}

I will keep thinking about it.

I woke up today and that's the first thing I thought about.

Again events where people hurt me verbally or physically or emotionally, most of which they never apologized for, and I always wonder why this happened to me, what I did to deserve that, and why did they target me out of everyone else. But sometimes my brain answers those questions for me. They did it because they hated me, because I deserved it, because I'm stupid, because I'm cringe, because I deserved to be made fun of, because I'm worthless etc. Nonsense I know.\nI also have pure O-OCD so obsessively fixating on triggering thoughts/memories could come from that.

Even when I’m sleeping, my mind doesn’t give me a break and I end up dreaming about them and waking up crying in pure desperation, sinking into deep sadness because this person is no longer in my life… and that’s just the brutal reality.\n\nI empathize so much with what you’re going through. I know how it feels to have such a deep connection to the point where you truly feel that person is your soulmate. It’s even hard to put into words the happiness, emotional bonding, and extreme joy of having someone so similar to you, someone to share the same hobbies with, where both of you are in sync and aligned in life values and goals. It’s so comforting and one of the best feelings I’ve ever felt in my entire life.\n\nWithout them, it hurts so much, even after a long time and sometimes it gets so bad that I feel physical pain. It feels like there will never be someone I can connect with and match so naturally on such a deeper level ever again.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, people are unique, so I know I won’t find someone exactly like my past relationship but it doesn’t stop hurting (almost like grief for what it was and what could have been).\n\nI feel like I’m at a point where I still can’t resignify a lot of things… like hobbies we used to share, places we used to go together and the list goes on. \n\nTheir presence inside me still lingers and some places, music and hobbies are still triggering for me because all I can think about is how much I wish I could turn back time to be with them again but with a healthier mindset of my own because I was struggling a lot with mental health issues and I became a burden for sure in many ways :( \n\nSo yeah, I understand the pain and I’m really sorry you’re suffering but I wanted you to know that there are people out there struggling just like us. I hope you feel more validated and less alone.\n\nUnfortunately, I don’t have advice on how to navigate through this because I’m in the same boat.

Except it led to her telling me about the concerns she was having on her end about whether she's even ready for a relationship because of her mental health and I started freaking out thinking she was gonna break up with me. She ended up getting so stressed that she had a panic attack on the call and I had no idea how to help, while also feeling super guilty because it was all a result of my need for attention. \nIt's what I did with my last relationship as well, and let's just say there's a reason that relationship didn't end well.

Then, when I accepted it peacefully like he said he wanted, he got upset at me for not fighting back, as if I was supposed to beg or argue over a choice I had no control over. By then, I had already given up so much of myself.\n\nAnd then today happened.\n\nHe brought up topics we had explicitly agreed to stop discussing, topics we promised never to revisit because we knew they were sensitive and tied to very different beliefs and opinions. Of course, he brought them back up anyway. It triggered me badly. I split.\n\nI got extremely upset and finally told him how exhausting being his friend had become. I’m splitting all the time. Constantly. And I keep hearing this voice in my head telling me I need to leave, because forcing something to work when it isn’t meant to feels like self-abuse at this point.

Since I'm diagnosed with EUPD (some other type of bpd) they will not pass my FAA medical certificate to fly. I've tried, it's been two years of trying but its led to no prevail. What is even the point anymore. This also correlates with my past suicide attempts that I've completely forgotten about like they're recorded but I don't recall them at all.\n\nTo factor off all of that, I've attempted to date, had a girlfriend for at least a month. She was absolutely stunning she was the most beautiful girl I have ever met. Had to find out the hard way that I'm just incapable of any form of dating. I really really loved this girl.  She had the same dreams that I've had, she literally went to the same college that I went to. She was an absolute angel I cannot lie. I know she cared about me threes no way she didn't. I think I hurt her though, I really feel like I hurt her. She was really upset with me the other night because I forgot everything she said and I don't know why. But yesterday she broke up with me because I'm too unpredictable and she just cannot understand my emotions. Like she told me that I'm the most confusing person she has ever met. It's my fault though. I was the one that constantly tried to break up with her because I don't think I'm good enough. Because she deserves so much better than me. So I guess it totally makes sense. I think I definitely emotionally drained her and it really fucks me up. I cant stop thinking about her. But now I've completely given up on love. It's just not for me I guess.\n\nNow I genuinely don't know what to do with my life anymore. I fucked up all the friendships that I've had, and I'm stuck working in a fuckass restaurant five days a week. I feel like I'm all alone\n\nSorry for getting this off my chest. I don't exactly know what I'm looking for out of this. So I guess if you have something to say then feel free to say it!!! Also feel free to downvote I don't care", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767922835.0, "id": "1q7uw2k", "author": "Critical_Employee_20", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1q7uw2k/dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life_anymore/"}

My anxiety, which is what I struggled with most, was gone, and I slowly began feeling less afraid to interact with people.\n\n  \nAfter months of re-learning how to talk to others without instant panic attacks, I've found myself with three new friends. We're in a group chat together now. This is something that hasn't happened to me in around 8 years. I haven't had a \"friend group\" in that long.\n\n  \nI'm happy for myself, but I feel a sense of incoming doom lingering over me. It's there. I'd say I'm still stable for now, and I know for a fact if I weren't medicated right now I wouldn't even have befriended these people, and if I somehow did, I'd be absolutely freaking the fuck out right now, having a total breakdown, so I'm glad that I'm not. Still, the sense of doom is there. \n\n  \nIt's just that the few times I had a friend group, they all fell apart. Granted those incidents happened when I was a kid, and in this current friend group we're all adults. I'm sure nothing explosive like that is going to happen, and yet I keep feeling like something terrible is going to happen because this is too good to possibly be true. My brain doesn't feel \"safe\" in this situation, I think.\n\n  \nNot to mention that insecurity is slowly creeping in too. I feel kind of annoying every time I talk there, even though these people are openly and clearly showing that they like me and enjoy my company. And the mere fact that these feelings are popping back up in the first place is making me feel worse...\n\n\n\nI don't want to become a completely hollow and unstable person like I was in 2024. I don't want to have daily panic attacks over friendships again because of feeling hated and unwanted without any evidence. I really hope that, for my own sake, things don't come to that. I finally made fucking friends and I've been lonely for so long, I want to enjoy this. But it's hard to enjoy it!

These things also are severe enough in my personal opinion to cause disorder. They're also not explicitly listed as criteria for BPD.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BPD", "title": "Why am I this way?", "text": "I’ve always found it fascinating how deeply childhood experiences shape who we become as adults.\n\n\nAs someone who has self-diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, I’ve spent a lot of time trying to understand where it may have come from. \n\nAfter hearing about the severe childhood trauma many people with BPD describe, I often thought, “Nothing that extreme happened to me.”\n\n\nBut over time, I’ve come to realize that trauma doesn’t have to be dramatic or obvious to be formative. Sometimes it’s quiet, cumulative, and misunderstood — especially by a child.\n\n\nFor me, it began when my grandfather died when I was seven years old. My father was never around, so my grandfather had stepped into that role. He was a good man and, to me, a hero. Losing him at such a young age was devastating. My mother believed I was too young to handle the loss, so she kept his death from me for weeks and didn’t allow me to attend the funeral. \nI never got the chance to say goodbye or to process the loss in any meaningful way.\n\n\nAt the same time, my father’s absence and the revolving door of men in my mother’s life created a pattern I couldn’t understand as a child. I would grow attached, and then they would disappear. Without the ability to place responsibility where it belonged, I internalized it. I assumed something about me made people leave.\n\n\nMy relationship with my mother added another layer of confusion. She could be loving and supportive one moment, then angry, cold, or verbally explosive the next. After those outbursts, I was often met with silence — sometimes for hours, sometimes for days. That inconsistency taught me early on that love could be withdrawn without warning.\n\n\nLooking back now, I can see how those experiences shaped me. I developed a negative self-image, anxiety around confrontation, difficulty expressing emotions, and a strong people-pleasing tendency driven by a fear of abandonment.\n\n Over time, those patterns left me feeling used, disposable, and repeatedly rejected.\nToday, trust is something I struggle with deeply. I keep people at a distance because part of me is always waiting for the moment they lie, use me, or leave. It’s reached a point where I often feel incapable of having a healthy relationship — not because I don’t want one, but because I don’t believe one is possible for me.\n\n\nI’m sharing this not for sympathy, but for understanding — both for myself and for anyone else who might read this and recognize parts of their own story. Sometimes the things that shape us most are not the loudest traumas, but the ones we were never taught how to process. \n\nUnderstanding these patterns doesn’t erase them, but it does give me language for experiences I once thought were personal failures.\n\n\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767893440.0, "id": "1q7i13a", "author": "ItsFluffy316", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1q7i13a/why_am_i_this_way/"}

It will probably be a difficult conversation to have, but I think it's worth trying to talk about and find a middle ground.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767904649.0, "id": "nygtqjq", "author": "ViTheIdiot"}

My bf(27) of nearly 3 years practically broke up with me. He started the conversation by saying that he doesn’t know what he wants anymore. We recently started living together, about 2 months ago and he has been taking care of everything due to me moving with him and leaving my job. I’ve had no luck in getting a job, although i’ve applied at many fast food places, got stood up by one which was the one thing I was clinging to for hope to resolve all this. So given that I understand that he is stressed out. But then he started saying that he isn’t enough for me because he can’t provide and that I’m not happy. He started putting himself down and telling me I can find someone that has better hygiene (I would constantly be on him telling him to brush his teeth, wash his face pretty much constantly nagging) \nHe brought up how I lied to him because when we first started dating he shared with me his favorite anime with hopes that I’d like it and I did I tried to watch it with him to bond and all that stuff you do when you meet someone but eventually I told him that I didn’t like it all that much (at least not enough to sit through 1000+ episodes of it) This because a subject to be brought up multiple times. So he started asking me why I lied about liking the show, my body count, if he was the biggest down there. He said he didn’t know if he could trust me because I’ve lied or just didn’t admit to those things. Once he did that I didn’t know what we can do about it anymore. It felt like he just wants to break up at that point. I packed my stuff that very moment and left to my parents. I texted him and he said he didn’t want to break up.. I didn’t want that either but I don’t know if there is anything we can do here. I’ve got bills coming up, no income, my family doesn’t really have the resources to help me either. I’ve just thrown everything away. I don’t know what is next. He offered to continue helping me with my car payment but I don’t trust that too much because he doesn’t want that responsibility.

Nobody wants to feel negative emotions, but sometimes they’re inevitable and are something we need to sit with, even when they feel uncomfortable. \n\nIt makes sense why you don’t feel good with your partner moving in with his friend. Your relationship has been progressing and arguably doing very well, so it’s only natural that moving in with him is the next goal on your mind. \n\nYou’re already aware of the logic behind it: you don’t have income, and your partner is moving in with someone who does because otherwise it’s nearly unaffordable. Sometimes, even knowing the logic can’t ease the pain. So then it’s important to consider what actions you can take to feel better. \n\nYour fear of abandonment has been triggered, and you worry that over time, the living situation will cause distance in the relationship. To counteract that, I think planning things you can do together, whether weekly or monthly, can help you feel more secure and close. Movie nights, coffee dates, walks in a park, etc. are all common things my partner and I do together to feel closer.

I'm sk impressed honestly!\n\n\nI do also know that even with all the realisation, the feelings still hurt a lot. I literally have a similar story. I got back with my boyfriend 2 years later. We had a very dramatic last, but we started to date slowly. He was sweet and kind but wanted to take things slow. We moved in together 2 years later after we got together. \n\n\nIt was super important to him to experience me not pushing him to hurry our relationship. It was so important for me to learn how to do that... I've decided wasting the time apart was bad enough and I don't want to waste more time fighting. I decided to trust him no matter what. My feelings like yours felt easily hurt and I felt easily put aside... He has a very social life and sometimes even 3 weeks would pass without meeting and I felt only I cared ( we lived 2 hours from eachother). But I decided to push through the pain. I felt it plenty and still decided to trust when he said sweet things to me. I've learned how to express my feelings without accusations ( that was super hard!! I always thought I was doing that, but it actually took so much practice). I've learned to listen to his emotional needs, without taking things personally.\n\n\nResult is that now I feel so loved and living together is absolute bliss. It just took a lot of practice. Without it honestly I don't think we'd have the relationship we do. I'm actually not experiencing pain when he hangs out with colleagues and some are women. Before when I was hearing a woman joined his team is already feel so much pain in my body...\n\n\nI really think if you take this time while he loves with his friend to keep on processing your feelings in a healthy way, you'll build the most amazing relationship! You'll also build a more stable future for yourself. I'm now in my job for almost 4 years without changing teams .. before I'd change teams and jobs every few months.. it was impossible to hold any stability in my life because so many things were causing me intense pain.\n\n\nI'm again so amazes with how well you express yourself and how well you understand the situation. I think it's only a matter of time until the intense pain you feel now will din down and last less and less.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BPD", "title": "Healthy Relationship with BPD", "text": "I always see people talk about unhealthy relationships and the negative parts of BPD, but not a ton of the \"it is possible\" posts. \n\nFor reference when I say its possible, that's coming from someone who was diagnosed at 15 by a specialist and later told that I was the worst case they'd seen. PLEASE don't take that as that bragging stuff. It's just to emphasize that I know this disorder is hell. And I still struggle a lot, but I want to say its possible. \n\nIve been with my boyfriend for over 2 years now and we have managed to maintain a happy and healthy relationship. Here's some of the ways we do it if anyone is interested:\n\n1. We have a shared calendar. This is where we put events, work, school, and other commitments we may have. It also allows us to schedule time together if we need it that is booked solid and needs valid reason for either of us to change (because sometimes that needs to happen when something comes up).\n\n    This helps us both. We know when the other is busy. When you both have busy schedules its hard to remember others events, especially if they are like a week ahead. We go over it once a week so we both know what's going on. It helps a lot with change. Sometimes hes laye from work. It just is a thing, so I know he works until x time and then add a half hour buffer and can expect that. Its saved us so many times. \n\n2. Shared location. This helps both of us believe it or not. I'm not allowed to turn my location off, and if I do its an immediate call to my dad typically. We just use google maps so it updates every so often. Aside from it being a safety thing, sometimes it's funny to tease about battery percentage. It also lets me know when hes driving so I dont go texting\n\n    Another big reason we do this is just curiosity. We are long distance and so when I go down to see him its helpful for me to already know aboit how long travel takes or where things are so Im not lost constantly. Its also cool to learn what is around where he lives. He gets to do the same with me. It helps him push me to try new things that are nearby and such. \n\n3. \"I need an off ramp.\" Lets be real, when splitting it's hard to come out of it and apologize or admit you're wrong sometimes. This can apply to general overwhelm as well. So instead of continuing to argue, I can say (I say I because he's much better at calming down than I am) \"I need an off ramp.\" We immediately stop talking and take some deep breaths. He guides me through it which is a massive help. He usually manages to make me laugh during it which is really grounding. It prevents things from continuing to escalate which like, yes please.\n\n4. Talking hat or something similar. We both suck at interrupting at times. So the other either mutes themselves or has something to signal it is their turn and then they mute or take the hat off to signal they are done talking. \n\n5. Feelings wheel. If youve ever done DBT, you probably know the feelings wheel. For EVERYONE it can be challenging to talk about emotions and recognize you can feel multiple, even opposing things at once. We take a few minutes whenever we can, even if not overwhelmed or something to talk about how we are feeling. Sometimes something comes up we didn't realize was happening for ourselves our the other person. Doing this when in a good mood helps everyone learn the emotion words too so its easier. \n\n6. Asking directly about thoughts. He will ask directly if he senses it if I am having thoughts of suicide or self harm. If Im struggling to answer he gives me yes/no questions.\n\n7. Fidgets. When we are talking about a difficult subject I have to have a fidget in my hand. Otherwise I pick my nails or something.\n\n8. No hard discussions after 8pm. Nights are my worst time. By the end of the day usually I can't take much more. I'm tired, overwhelmed, and just nights aren't my thing. Doing this prevents arguments and misunderstandings.\n\n9. Having go to activities for different energy levels. So like are we in the mood for a movie (and then we have a list or you can use the queue app), board games, animal crossing, doing our own things while on call, and a few others.\n\nI think this is most of them.\n\nWe have been together over two years now and these things help both of us. These are things we came up with together. Theres other things we do for his ADHD and insomnia, etc. But these are the BPD specific ones I think. \n\nLet me know if you try any of them or have any other tips for people to try in their relationship.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "I leave the relationship stuff within our relationship typically. If there's something going wrong, it's our job to fix, together. I saw a post on here that went something along the lines of \"When problems come up, or you're having an argument, it's not about winning, or being right. It's about working together to solve the problem. Remember, you're on the same team\" and that helped a lot.\n\nI very rarely include friends in our relationship stuff, and if I do, I take a good 48 hours to think about it first.\n\nMy biggest suggestion (since you are asking) would be wearing something silly when you are starting to argue, both of you do that. It's a little hard to stay mad when the other person is wearing dollar store bunny ears or something. And then also, take some space when getting mad. Using that off ramp as soon as possible. Take 20 minutes or so to calm down doing an activity you love, or ask him to do it with you.\n\nA really helpful DBT skill I learned was the TIPP skills, particularly the temperature.

Even the most empathetic person would burn themselves out.\n\nBpd is considered treatable so could very well be that the partner - now also being fully aware of the situation - will become more self aware of their actions and find better coping mechanisms.\n\nI thought feeling this intensely was normal and now that I know it’s not, I’m actively working on getting better.

This is something that can show to a partner that despite there being bad moments sometimes it doesn’t define your future.\n\nAnd it’s not easy even if someone is making an effort but seeing that effort being made is definitely a big part in managing to stay calm and realising that even if it feels like you are the recipient it’s not really meant for you.\n\nMy partner once said: “it got easier when I realised that instead of yelling back you probably just need a hug.”\n\nI have been very vocal about him needing to think about his best (setting up the boundaries) and we communicate very efficiently and often.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "I’ve been w my partner w bpd for almost 5 years and Ive definitely not always managed to be as helpful as I wanted in every situation and I’m always learning but they’re are a few things that u should always keep in mind. Episodes are very distressing for the person w bpd and a lot of the times they may be/seem directed at you, because that’s how splitting works sometimes, try to not shift the conversation or the subject on the way that they may phrase themselves somehow (but always listen to what they’re saying) and mainly focus on the emotion behind it and on what they need to be heard and helped. You can always address things that might’ve bothered you or hurt you after the episode is over, and establish better communication through that. But the last thing that will help ur partner during an episode is accusatory language or blame even if u don’t intend it that way. Assure them that you’re not leaving them, that they’re not too much. I know it might be easy to be caught up in ur own emotions sometimes when your partner is having an episode, but it’s going to be healthier for both of you if they can acclimatise from their episode and THEN discuss whatever is bothering u. That also depends from person to person, but give them space. If you’re long distance or just don’t live together, and you’re texting during a breakdown or an episode and u feel like ur going in circles or that nothing is helping, OFFER them the option of taking a break and giving them some time to themselves. A way to do that without making it seem like you’re leaving them (besides saying that you’re not, obviously) is to send a text and tell them that if they need space they can just leave you on read and get back to u whenever they want to. That way they don’t feel like they’ve been the last one to reach out/ like theyre not being   Left on read in the process of “being given space”. It’s also important to have conversations about what helps them specifically at times where they’re feeling better. Some people will need more space, some people will need you to show them that you’re there. Usually it’s both, so u need to be able to figure out the signs and the ways they would communicate to u during the episode, so you can help them accordingly. Because asking them exactly what they need during an episode isn’t usually as productive. In bpd and cptsd in general, the nervous system goes into overdrive when triggered, and it also might be more triggering if they feel like you are asking them what to do and putting that on them. It’s hard to even KNOW what they want in that situation. So knowing what to do before is very helpful for both of u. There’s a ton of more things but it really depends on what ur partners needs are. Just remember to put them first when they’re in an episode, to always tell them that you’re not going anywhere, and that they’re safe, and to communicate communicate communicate", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767907577.0, "id": "nyh4s0m", "author": "Signal-Tiger-247"}

I've been with a person with BPD for about 2-3 years now and i truly love them with all my heart and soul, but right now it's been about a month or so that they've discarded/detached from me and about 20-25 days of NC now which it's truly painful and i will do anything i can to get back together and make them happy, take care of them and help them feel better again.\n\nI'm not sure if this is realistic/true or not but, i was thinking that let's say normal people have 70kg-100kg of rice usually and that's their capacity, so normally they have a lot more room to waste and test and etc, for example if they use 2kg for testing and 3kg for eating, they can put like 7kg instead of 5kg back to their capacity and even make it grow or just add the 5kg back like after a few days, but for BPD people their normal capacity is like 5kg, so they have a lot less capacity and rice, they don't have the luxury to test or fail, for them, even 1 seed of rice is extremely important and is really life of death, that's the reality. for the rich, 1000$ a day is like their dinner, it's nothing, but for the poor, 1$ is a lot and the line between them surviving or dying. that's why the BPD person is extremely sensitive most of the times and for most things ( not always and not every single time of course ). If you only have 5kg of rice to live with and that's the ONLY thing you have and it'll take for example a few weeks to just recover 1kg or 500g of it, then you can't afford to lose at all, you can't afford to fail, there's tremendous fear and it is justified and valid, it's completely understandable that the person with BPD reacts with extreme anger, madness, sadness, feeling betrayed or lied to or any other feelings, they have 5kg of rice, of course they're not gonna say \"oh well it's ok that i lost 2kg for testing that new therapy thing or new relationship, I'm gonna recover in like 4 years\", they're gonna be furious cause that's HUGE realistically for them, but most people have that 70kg-100kg of rice, so they don't even think about 2kg or 5kg.\n\nNow we can say the same thing for the personality. Let's say most people have like 50% to 70% of their personality usually figured out and it's consistent most of the times ( they know who they mostly are and what their goal is and what they want ), but for the pwBPD, let's say they have only 5% which is variable, so one day it could be 1.5%, another it could be 3.7%, next day 0.1% .... you get the point, so with that reality, of course they can't bare or tolerate any mistake or anything that goes wrong, the personality is already at the lowest point, lower than that is emptiness, nothingness and void. no one, literally no human ( i would even go as far as saying no living being ) wants to be there. for non-bpd people, 20%-40% feels like life has no meaning anymore, it makes you really depressed and you stop living and doing things, etc, now if you go down to 10% your whole body and soul feels dead and it's extremely painful/maddening state to be in, and it takes a really really long time to get out of, if you ever can get out of ... . Now try to understand and imagine how someone with 0.1% to 5% feels, in that state any reaction, like even the most extreme reactions are valid, correct and truly justified, so it's actually NOT \"extreme\" or \"too much\" it's completely understandable if you think about it.\n\n\\* It doesn’t mean that every behavior is okay, just that from the inside it can feel like that. ( if I'm not wrong ).\n\n\\* The feelings are as intense as life‑or‑death. that’s what I’m trying to capture.\n\nI hope this helps you understand a bit more about BPD.

It truly means a lot for me.\n\n\\* This is my personal perspective as someone who loves a person with BPD. And it's my attempt to understand what my person with BPD might feel. happy to be corrected by people who actually have BPD.\n\n**\\*** I'm not trying to generalize this idea and of course everyone is different and unique.

I really appreciate any advice.\n\nFor background, I was diagnosed with BPD this year. I'm in therapy and am starting medication. My issue is, I feel almost nothing as intensely as I feel jealousy. \n\nIt's interfereing with my relationships. When I percieve someone as having more than me, more resources or oppurtunities, I become physically ill and incredibly depressed. I just shut everyone out and ramble to myself or in my notes app. Today was particularly bad. \n\nA close friend of mine sent me a letter which I recieved this morning, and included were photos of her trips around the world this year, and pictures of her happy family.\n\n She's, admittedly, much more well off than I am, and I became so distressed by the fact that she was seeing the world and having affluent parents as a support system while I was doing practically nothing with my life but school and work. I spiraled all day in bed, from the minute I opened it to now. I've had at least five fits of crying (Like, full on ugly sobs.) This happens so, so often, everytime something makes me even the slightest bit envious. Every night at this point about various people I know.\n\nI'm incredibly embarrased to seek help for this, because jealousy so severe it causes people to hurl is, I think, not very common, and I'm ashamed of it. My therapist is still relatively new to me, so I can't help but project the image that I'm a little more put-together than I really am. Maybe that's stupid, but for now I'd be more comfortable trying to navigate this on my own, at least until my next session. I also need this feeling to be alieviated just a bit, If only so I can fall asleep.\n\nI'm hoping someone who's experienced a little more of life with diagnosed BPD can help me out here, any advice means the world.

I haven't built any skills as I've just survived my entire life, and even if I went and did my job I don't know if I would get laid off and get ruined. \n\n\nIt won't stop, the thoughts, the rumination \n\n\n\nMy mind takes me back to a BPD ex that was also struggling, saying she would rather self harm than leave me. Saying how if I left her she would never get over me, would never be the same, never love anyone again. I saw this as unhealthy but she really valued me at the same time. Also said she always loved me more than I did her, and when it ended went for a fling and started calling everything temporary in her life, including me and also devaluing me after. \nShe also saved my life from a heat stroke, bonded over a couple other traumas but it was a way to cope for reality for both of us, I resent dating someone like that I can't blame myself for being 18 but it was a baaaad idea to date someone like that as a lot of traumatic things for both of us. I shut down and my brain started to not live without her, or other people it got addicted to and she shut it off and moved on to drown out that pain ig. \nOfc not the worst person she had a lot of great caring qualities that stemmed from that abuse and awareness, but also triggered insecurities of not being enough, people pleasing and shrinking down to avoid being ridiculed, academic pressure being my identity in the community and schools I went to, and a very unstable probably BPD father with a mother with anxious attatchment. \n\nIt's every second of every day, in my dreams, it takes me to 3 people, telling me to be safe including my ex and I beg my brain to stop, it's all bullshit I know it this is a complete stranger but it won't stop, even when I beg it to stop so it's not all my mindset. \nI stalked her a while back and now those images don't go away. My mind keeps telling me to feel this crack when my life was filled with friends that loved me for me back then. and I finally felt happy. My relationships are all based on safety now or complete avoidance since I don't feel emotions, none of them are based on interest. I just rant about my conditions while I try to function as a human being, just eating, drinking water, barely sleeping but being in incredible shape to help me function. I can't do anything anymore, I try to watch shows and games but after this process of trying to heal, my mind just analyzed everything for why people act the way that they do, it's just psychoanalysis after psychoanalysis, and now I did it to myself to help myself but now I just see it as that, and it's so strong, I don't know how to function when I just see meaning in everything to cope. \n\nI've been dissociated for a lot of periods of my life, abused, probably neurodivergent, diagnosed adhd but don't know how much of it is this or the borderline. I can't enjoy anything I just see what can get me dopamine such music, I just mask with my impulsivity, my mind automatically sexualizes everything, and when I was healthy that never really mattered. I have severe memory loss and lived every day with dissociation constantly being denied by most family and friends. Was against meds but I am now on Wellbutrin, lamictal, and a few other meds being phased out. I get existential a lot and looked into religions of non duality, but now I can't go back to thinking normally, and now I'm scared I'm going to lose touch with reality as my brain defended me by shutting down my emotions. I always avoided weed and alcohol but in college did it to socialize with people, and scared damage has been done to my brain. I told myself that it doesn't matter since I'm so dissociated this wouldn't affect much. \nMy self esteem has always been in the gutter I think I'm not interesting and don't provide value to other people's lives. \n\nI can heal, but I will always remember rock bottom. This hell. when my family denied me this. The suicidal ideation is bad but I'm too scared for that, everywhere I look it's hell on earth. \n\nI'm going to New York in 5 hours, alone, when I'm scared my mind is going to snap all alone with all of these thoughts and this will trigger some type of psychosis as I am slowly losing touch bit by bit. \n\nFor a couple of days is my trip, I have no plans other than tour places and loosely booking a trip. \nThis is really bad right now, and I don't know what to do.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BPD", "title": "Sharing advice I was given by a friend with BPD and bipolar", "text": "Hi everyone! A few weeks ago I spoke with someone who was diagnosed with BPD and bipolar 3 years ago. She gave me some amazing advice that I want to share with you as I started to implement these things in my daily life that have really improved my overall health and wellbeing.\n\n1. It is necessary for people with mental illness and disorders to have a routine. Start your day by doing something that gives you comfort and happiness. However, it is not possible to turn your life around in the span of one day, you need to start your daily routine by doing one or two things only and then when you are ready you add more things to your routine. If something makes you feel uncomfortable or gives you bad feelings/emotions, do not do this in your routine. You ALWAYS need to make sure you have everything possible to do your routine. If you start your routine by making coffee, always make sure you have coffee, milk, sugar; ect the day before. If you need to ask someone to help you get the things you need to complete your routine every day, please do this.\n2. If you struggle to sleep, lay down flat on your back with your hands by your side and try to feel every single part of your body starting from your toes. Breathe slowly and deeply. This distracts you from anxiety and overwhelming thoughts. Watch or listen to something that gives you comfort at night like a video game walkthrough, look at pictures of a pet, read a book ect. Also make sure you turn off the blue light on your phone at 7 or 8pm. You can set your phone to do this automatically for you so your eyes feel more tired at night.\n3. When you are in crisis, do not stay in the same position. You need to do something that distracts your brain and refreshes it. Showers for me have been very helpful, if I am deep in a crisis episode I turn on the shower and sit there under the warm water until I feel better. This has not yet failed me. If you dont like showers, sit outside and breathe or take a walk outside.\n4. Go outside every single day, even if you have nothing to do. If you have a park close to your house go there and sit on a bench for at least 10 minutes. If you dont have a park close to you think of a nice place that you enjoy being at, ideally where you can watch people, cars, ect. Take a book if you enjoy it too, it is important to get fresh air every day.\n5. Take a journal and write something down every day, even if it is small or negative. You cannot let your emotions and thoughts brew up inside of yourself. This can also help you when you are in crisis. Write down how you feel and what is going through your mind. This has really helped me as I often have strong thoughts and feelings throughout the day. When I feel one, I write it down. Take your journal with you if you go somewhere so you when you feel a strong thought you can write it down instantly.\n\nThis is all I have so far, if anyone has anything else at all to add please share! If it can help at least one person :) Good luck soldiers it will be okay.", "score": 21, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767810348.0, "id": "1q6n9m0", "author": "Informal_Celery_6900", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1q6n9m0/sharing_advice_i_was_given_by_a_friend_with_bpd/"}

Don’t be afraid to ask for help, try to assess that the irrational fear of rejection/conspiracy/hate is worth it to simply try). Even casual talk, make it a goal to initiate conversations more often, albeit easier said than done. Support, acceptance and kindness from good people will help with the paranoia.

I don’t really know what it meant at the time, did a little research on it and went on with my life. It wasn’t until my Senior year that I was in the talking stage with a guy and he assumed I had BPD. That immediately turned off the idea of a relationship for him and he told me how the last four relationships he’d been in had been with toxic people with BPD and how. He told me that I was making him my favorite person and I had no clue what he meant. That was when I first looked at this subreddit and saw others experiences. Ive always had anger problems but I have no idea what things like splitting are. I’ve never been in a relationship so I can’t say much but I don’t think I’d ever split on a partner. He told me that it doesn’t matter whether I think I will or not and the fact that I have BPD alone means I’ll be exactly like them. I was heartbroken but I guess I understand what he means to an extent. Most of the guys I’ve talked to have blocked me. Mainly for crossing boundaries like spamming them and stuff but he was the last guy that had ever happened with. Now I’m a freshman in college and I feel conflicted. I don’t face problems as bad as before. It’s easier to control my anger but I am attached to this new guy. He doesn’t feel the same way about me but I don’t know if by me sticking around and waiting for him. That I’m giving into my BPD and treating him like a favorite person.

I think there is a bit more to it than that, bc personally it feels to me like a person I am very attached to and deeply sensitive about how they act towards me. I also think there’s an element of things “not being okay” without them. I think you are able to be diagnosed at a young age if you meet the criteria people were just not looking for it when I was younger and thought I just had ADD PTSD MDD GAD and we didn’t know about the OCD or binge eating yet. Then at 26 my psych was like hey I think it’s BPD. So if BPD resonates as true for you then don’t let someone tell you that you don’t have it.

Al I can do is either smoke cigs, eat, smoke weed and cry! Because no matter what I do I feel insanely restless and uneasy. I can't concentrate on nothing, not even watching a goddamn show beacuse all I think about is how painfully terrifying being alive.\n\nBut before this med, I wasn't doing so great either, this med I thought it was going to be my salvation.\n\nThis last year was terrible. I started to depend on meds to sleep (racing thoughts don't let me concentrate on sleeping); \n\nmy parents split up, I am alone most of the time and I hate it, I'm living with my mom whose presence feels more lonely than actually being alone; \n\nI got my first job but had to quit because of the delicate state of stress it put me through (it had me on a state of continuous panic attacks that lasted 5 days), this made me lose my classes and i drop the career;\n\n Because of strees i've been on delirant rants about dying multiple times of the year, the worst one was when my cat, who was having neurological issueas died, and i thought I was having the same thing, I would cry to my mom telling her I was about to die off of the same thing.\n\nI pushed aways friends because of my constant deppresed mood and irritability, my longest friendship, of 20 years.\n\nThese last 8 months I spent doing nothing, things in Argentina ard harder than ever so there's literally no jobs for someone who has no degree.

After that I spent two months completely doomed and deppressed, I felt demoralized as I never felt before.\n\nAnd after several months spending every day worrying about what to do with my life and how to not feel panic every single day, I came across a career I find interesting that it helped me feel motivated again.\n But now the cycle started again and with the akathisia I can't even explain how much DESPERATION I'm feeling. It's not that much different from my typical crisis but this time is constant, no matter what I do, what used to make me feel the least calm at some point doesn work anymore, and the feeling is 24/7, I'm going insane and my psychiatrist is not taking me that serious because I smoke pot ( I'm addicted to it).\n\nI'm honestly tired, everyone around me is progressing and growing up and getting their titles and i'm going nowhere and getting my brain fried each year it passes.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BPD", "title": "Unable to seek help, can I (19 ftm) manage myself?", "text": "Hello all. I was nervous about even making this post at first, but I decided to go through with it, however not without explaining why I'm even asking this in the first place. (If you want to skip this background info, I left a marker of where to pick back up underneath).\n\n  \nTo address what I said in the title, I am unable to seek help both for a diagnosis and for help with the issues I face regardless of not having anything diagnosed on paper. I still live with my father (61 M) who is very mentally ill, but he's part of the generation that doesn't believe in mental health in almost any degree (for example, he doesn't believe in the existence of ptsd, but he believes in the existence of the serious ones like schizophrenia, and any time I'm upset over pretty much anything it's just me being \"soft\" and being a little baby and I never have any valid reason to be upset over anything he does. Hopefully that puts into perspective the kind of person that raised me \\[or more accurately just gave me resources, I fully believe that I raised myself off of the resources he gave me\\] and subsequently explains why I am the way I am today.) I only bring this up because he makes it impossible for me to seek help for myself, and I can't do it behind his back because he is involved in *everything* that I do, nothing can ever go past him without questioning and/or ridicule, and therefore I am completely on my own. \n\nNow back to my undiagnosed point: I personally really frown on self-diagnosing, but my friend (who is also my fp; 20 ftm) and I have had it to a point where I am just unbearable and irrational that he is certain that BPD is some of what's wrong with me, and I can't wait any longer to try and seek some sort of help. I looked up how clinics give this kind of diagnosis and other things it could be, and so far, BPD has been the best fit. I've seen multiple versions of the listed requirements for BPD and I hit almost all of them. (Just a note: The only reason I really care about figuring out what it is on my own is, so I know how to effectively navigate it. Giving me a label isn't going to change how I am; I just hate how I am and I want it to stop.) This is why I come to this subreddit asking for help. I wasn't sure if this should be marked as question or advice since this is technically both and I can't tag it as both, so I'm sorry if this seems misleading in any way because of that.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe actual asking part begins here for those that don't want to read the background information:\n\n  \nI've seen that betterment is possible (as I've heard it referred to as remission) and I wanted to ask is this possible to achieve without professional help? And if so, how can I go about it?\n\n  \nMy only support system is my fp (bless his heart for how much he both helps and tolerates me), however we have excellent communication. He is always able to calm me down during a split, and he is genuinely really really good at handling me at my worst. However I always feel guilty and disgusted with myself, and I want to try and improve so that he doesn't have to deal with the splits nor the restrictions I impose on him from being overly sensitive and unable to handle a lot of topics (such as his friends, his self-shipping, etc). He says I don't, but I feel like I often drain him, and I just want to try and improve not only for myself, but for him. I am willing to put in as much work and effort as this requires me to put in, and I talked with him briefly about coming here asking the only place I feel like I even have a chance. I'm expecting this to be extremely difficult/a very bumpy road, but I'm desperate and I don't know if I can wait until my father finally dies.

You can also try using self help DBT books to potentially help with regulating your emotions, and journaling/posting on here even to help with coping.

I am a F36, just fyi, cause I dont know if what I am going to try explaining can change from one sex to another.\n   Writing this down could also help me understanding this process more or so I hope, and maybe facing in a better way reincidence of deregulation.\n\nSo the point is that I understood (after a tone of therapy and DBT and still taling antidepressants) that internal self-reflection (about me, my impulses, the reason why I do and feel certain things towards someone else or a specific situation, the possible consequences of my impulses on me and on others, etc) is the main tool I have to self-regulate, get more stable, stop the impulses and feel much much better (together with meds). \n\nThe issue is that selfreflection works properly only when I manage to FEEL it in my body and mind after a superhuman internal effort of logic, thoughts, self-reflection, external and internal analysis, and facts, then I can self-regulate and make healthy decisions that I *truly feel*; I don't say I am regulated just for the sake of saying it or cause its cool or to impress others. Those feelings are real. And then I feel okay, I'm regulated.\n\nNevertheless together with this new big step recently, it came the disappointment of....falling many times shortly after deregulating, often after a small trigger. \n    So: the good thing is that I know I have the capacity inside me of regulating by myself though self-reflection again, but the bad thing is that I understood how self-reflection really works ONLY when I really FEEL that self-reflection (for instance during self reflection on someone I start feeling emotionally detached from them, or I feel zero anxiety towards being unemployed cause I self reflected about why and what to do, and so on). These are true, strong, fulfilling feelings even when it is deattachment (as we are not used to feel deattachment towards others often, it can be felt strongly in the body and mind by pwBPD although it's difficult to imagine it from the outside) and if i do feel the things I self-reflected about, I later do regulate successfully, I dont give up to impulses, I am a mature human being and I feel so good and happy.\n\nBut when I mess with myself cause of some random trigger again, even on the same issue I regulated on already, it's tough. I have to do a huge amount of internal work with my thoughts to avoid becoming dysregulated again, but I often struggle to AGAIN FEEL the self-reflection, so the regulation doesnt work and I give up to my impulses.\n It means I can self-reflecting again RATIONALLY but its VERY HARD to FEEL again the self-reflection I am doing in my body and mind, which doesnt give me a successful self-regulation.\n\n Does it make sense?

Despite my extensive experience getting sick, I always find that about halfway through recovery (when I’m no longer bedridden but still symptomatic), I get so utterly anxious and sensitive. It really strikes-me-in-the-abandonment.\n\nWhen you are sick, obviously no one wants to be around you, which is understandable. However, even after you are better/mostly better, people still (unpredictably) don’t want to be near you. Some people treat you like a pariah for having been sick, which is deeply upsetting. It brings out all sorts of rejection sensitivity and feeling like everybody hates me!\n\nI find that it’s very normalized to be a little defensively-unsympathetic to sick people, and I hate to sound like a baby but it hurts my feelings. Even post-recovery, people are very quick to go “Oh, don’t get me sick! Stay over there!” which really sends the message that you’re not wanted. Sometimes it’s more like, “Yeah you can be here as long as you don’t give it to me! Haha it’s fine…but if I get sick I’m going to blame you!” which just makes me feel really responsible for something that’s kind of out of my control. Either way, it makes me feel so bad about being present and like I’m on super thin ice—it feels like everyone is or is going to be mad at me, and does not want me around.\n\nAnd, especially since the pandemic, we don’t have particularly hard and fast rules about when you’re allowed to reintegrate into a social setting after being sick. I often have one or two symptoms that will audibly linger for an extra week after getting better, which always makes me feel super bad and anxious about seeing people again, because I don’t want them to treat me like I’m still sick, but I can’t stay home for two weeks straight either. I know no one wants to catch something, and that medical anxiety is at a cultural high, but the way we treat recently-sick people like spilled viles of poison hits a sore spot for me. \n\nUgh there are just so many components that stress me out and hurt my feelings. Sorry if this was super ramble-y or incomprehensible, and so sorry for how long this is, I’m struggling to streamline my thoughts about this.

I've been living in hell for the past three years. Every morning I wake up with some kind of obsession or tension in my head. It's quite difficult to describe. Incredibly strong tension, mental and emotional. Something that is impossible to tolerate. You can't distract yourself from it. No matter what I do, no matter how I distract myself, it always wins. I would call it a meaningless obsession. During the day, it builds up, and after 4-5 hours after waking up, the feeling is strong enough to endure. But I continue to endure it, hoping that I will come up with something. After about seven hours, I start overeating. I can't say that this is exactly compulsive overeating, because I don't consume food at an incredible rate, but I eat everything I can until physical pain sets in. I can't explain why this senseless obsession is specifically related to food. I probably chose this method three years ago and formed strong neural connections in my head. I eat normally throughout the day and don't restrict myself; I don't have a restrictive eating disorder. I simply use food as a way to cope with this feeling. If at the beginning of my illness I did this once a week, now I overeat every day and spend 80% of my income on it. I have OCD, closer to pure OCD, and I understand how it works.\nI'm in stable remission and it rarely bothers me. I assume that all my obsessions were clearly connected to something, but here it's simply an initially unrelated, unbearable obsessive tension in my head. When I can't stand it, I commit a compulsion and overeat huge portions of food. With my OCD, I was afraid of something and created compulsions to avoid it, and I understand the logic, but in the case of food, there is no initial anxiety. The tension itself is empty and unrelated. It's just always been with me for three years. It hasn't gone away for a second, but my episodes of binge eating suppressed it for a while. Previously, it would last a week, and now it's one day. I don't want to wake up in the morning knowing that I'll have to face this feeling again, which is destroying me from the inside. I don't want to complain, guys, but my life is hell right now. I'm a hostage to this internal tension, and it makes me cry every day. Maybe you can help me. Maybe it's not OCD at all.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "I feel you. I just got diagnosed last year at 30 and it threw me in an identity and existential crisis then MDD that I’m still struggling to recover from.\n\nWhat I’ve found is that the emptiness you described is exactly what we feel once we stop distracting ourselves and start facing the problem. It’s super painful but I’d like to think we’re finally looking at the wound now. \n\nFor over 10 years, I’ve never felt empty but always managed to ruin every relationship I’ve ever had with good people, and I could not control my emotions at all, in any circumstances with anyone. But still, I never felt empty. Because anytime things got uncomfortable, I had my distractions and fixes. I practically drowned myself in alcohol and hookups whenever things didn’t feel right, so I never confronted the problem. I felt confident, I had an identity, I achieved a lot, I was always the life of the party.\n\nI’m now just about a year sober, and I’ve given up on dating and relationships and refuse to sleep with anyone. I thought it would be empowering at first because that seems to be other people’s experience but for me it just made me sink deeper and deeper into darkness. I’ve never felt this empty in my life, most days I feel like a ghost like I don’t even exist. I don’t know who I am, I feel lost, unsafe, insecure, unwanted, abandoned, forgotten, unworthy and directionless. I suddenly don’t even recognize myself.\n\nIn a way it feels like the diagnosis did this to me. But then I realized that the diagnosis just forced me to drop the distractions and unhealthy coping mechanisms to make me see that at the core, without those distractions and vices, there is a terrified little child who never felt safe and had to wear a mask and pretend to be the adult that he needed to be.\n\nI think I’m just starting to recognize the wound so that I can slowly learn to tend to it. Finally seeing the wound is the scariest part because it’s coming to terms with a reality that I’ve been avoiding my whole life. It feels like we’ve been standing in a burning house, and instead of putting it out, we turn on the tv to distract ourselves because dealing with the fire is scary. \n\nI think you’re doing the right thing. What we’re doing is essentially voluntarily stepping into the dark. It’s painful, but it’s necessary. I’d like to think the beginning is the hardest part because it takes a lot of courage and resilience to face who you really are and not run away or give up. Most don’t have to do this kind of work. Most who should do this kind of work also refuse to. \n\nThe diagnosis really forced me to face a reality I wasn’t able to accept yet, I’m still struggling with it everyday. But I’d like to think that one day we will find peace, somehow.", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1767776127.0, "id": "ny63nwa", "author": "Bam_Adedebayo"}

Blow the candle out when ready and with that the urge to blow up everything. Re-blow out that candle as often as needed.

Since then, life has been heavy — long-term relationship conflict, becoming a parent, financial pressure, and trying to keep everything together without really processing grief.\n\nRecently I was diagnosed with BPD, and a lot has started to click. Growing up, attachment wasn’t stable — one parent regularly pulled me away from people I was close to, which taught me early on that connection could disappear suddenly.

I’m not proud of it, and I’m not trying to justify it.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "my reply got really long im sorry . its basically all the other stuff my boyfriend has done in our 18 month relationship  \n  \nyes this is how i feel . but he told me i talk like that so much he struggles to keep taking it seriously . but its not really true . i dont talk like that to him often at all , its only picked up more recently . and to be honest the main time i talk so dramatically to him and get so upset is when he is purposefully doing things that upset me . like he has broken up with me on my birthday in front of everyone because he saw me getting assaulted as \"disrespect\" (says its my fault i went out getting too drunk with a guy he deemed 'unsafe' but i thought was okay since he was my best friend for literally 6 years) , he stayed with me because i was really upset and he wanted to \"make sure i was okay\" but then he ended up staying over and sleeping with me the next day and then just leaving my flat and telling everyone i cheated . literally made his entire circle hate me . during this whole situation , he once acted nice to me in front of other people but afterward came to my flat drunk while i was crying and upset and he stood in my face shouting \"you did this on purpose . you deserve to feel guilty\" and when i started literally CRASHING OUT BREAKING DOWN CRYING he hugged me and told me he loved me and we would be together again soon and literally said \"youre the one , i love you , ill always love you\" just to leave at 4am and later tell me he was just lying and didnt want me to keep crying . while i was at the police station telling the police about the NUMEROUS assaults that had happened on me in my life he called me and argued with me so bad i started screaming crying at the actual station and an officer had to take me to the bathroom to throw up because i was so upset that i was alone at a police station trying to get support and got this stupid phone call where he just wanted to scold me and tell me how hurt he was that i had \"disrespected\" him.   \n  \nhe once broke up w me over text while i was in hospital after getting spiked so bad at a club that i woke up passed out in the street at 3am with no memory . he has been lovely to me in lots of ways and done a lot of wonderful things for me too but he ignores my on the daily , argues with me daily , never comes to my flat and always makes me come to him , does little things that make me feel weird like keep a note from his ex in his wallet and argue with me when i say he should remove it . he never comes to my gigs (i have a career as a musician and gig semi regularly and he has only ever come to ONE while we werent even together) , once he argued with me for hours before i had to go on stage until i was screaming and crying so bad and physically ill , stuck in my bathroom IN MY HOUSE , litrally an hour before i had to be on stage , i literally PASSED OUT ON STAGE because of the stress and i didnt even get paid for the gig because i didnt perform fully .   \n  \nonce while we were kinda half together but not officially dating he came to my house covered in hickeys and when i mention it in arguments he says \"we werent together , we just slept together a couple times\" while genuinely disgusts me because thats not how i saw it at all . we saw each other for literally a WEEK and we werent even officially dating or anything and within that week i already started to get the impression that he wasnt into me so i left and saw someone else for a while and although i feel it was wrong to just straight from my ex to this other person , i was literally within my right because i broke up w him first and we were only hanging out again for a week , but now he brings it up over and over in every argument as some sort of golden ticket to treat me however he wants . he tells me i will never understand what its like to \"work a full time job\" because he thinks  i can just live off off daddys money , despite the fact that i worked full time when i was 16 , worked part time here n there through uni but am ultimately unable to work like he does because i am physically and mentally not able to because of my four diagnosed mental issues and three diagnosed physical issues that PHYSICALLY DISABLE ME .   \n  \nhe has no interest in travelling with me , wont even go on walks with me , hates my parents even tho theyre nice to him , has anger issues and gets so angry that he shakes and goes red in the face , once explained to me in graphic detail for like an hour how he wanted to physically and violently wreck some men that hurt me (idc if he was mad about what they done to me it still frightened me) , goes out in like joggers and a hoodie when i have dressed up and never reflects the same effort i put in to seeing him ,  goes to sleep and wakes up whenever he feels like it (often will wake up at 5am with a loud ass alarm , turn the lights on , get in the shower and either do work at his pc or go gym and wont even keep the lights off for me so i can sleep longer . never warns me about this and when i say i want to sleep longer he ignores me) .   \n  \n anyway im sorry thats a lot . im just venting at this point . i love him very much and we do have a lot of really wonderful times but he does all these things that are just horrible .", "score": 1,

They were going to put me inpatient but after 5 days at lotus they said they can’t see what can be done in inpatient for me so I went home.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "You don't deserve to be suffering like this. I know you're scared. I know that getting mental health help doesn't feel mental health friendly. But you are worthy of feeling better.\n\nYour doctor legally could not tell you that the psych ward is at capacity and deny you care. They could literally lose their license for saying that to you if you hurt yourself. If the hospital near you is full and you're having suicidal ideation, they will find one for you to go to. And if your doctor won't help, you can call emergency services and tell them you want to hurt yourself.\n\nI know you're terrified, but my frst recommendation if you can't get yourself to start taking meds on your own is to consider taking the leap and going to an in-patient psychiatric hospital. I work at one because it saved my life, and I see people who are just as scared and in pain as you are start to get better every day. I mean it. They come in on the worst days of their lives and leave with direction and hope.\n\nI know it's not what you want to hear, but you really need to get on medication. Going to a place like that will let you ask questions about every single pill, talk to a doctor every day to change what you don't like, and bug the heck out of mental health professionals with all of your concerns about the journey you're on. That's what we're there for! The routine can really help with the chaos, too.\n\nAnd there are tons of types of therapy. If the standard CBT doesn't work for you, that's okay. You may need a therapist that specialize in trauma, or DBT, or EMDR, or sooo many other possibilities. Saying therapy won't work for you tells me you haven't tried the right kind of therapy or found the right therapist. Good therapy is not \"how does that make you feel?\" It teaches coping mechanisms and life skills.\n\nAnother idea for some help is to look into community programs in your area. Groups for ptsd, stuff like that.\n\nAnd there are tons of things you can find even on YouTube. Look up stuff like how to heal from ptsd, what to do about overwhelming anxiety, how to get out of bed when you're too depressed or scared. You can even find things like how to move past narcistic abuse, how to ask for help, etc.\n\nI know you're overwhelmed. I've been there. It can get better, I promise.

I tried a few times and it did nothing. \n\nBut then i began every day and ending every night telling myself i was 'healthy, happy and capable' even though i wasn't. It took about 3 months to start actually kicking in. Now i actually am happy and in bpd remission. \n\nThese might not help you but i hope they do. Negative self talk was the root of all my evils because my nervous system could never calm down while i was actively telling myself i was unsafe and unhappy. That led to years of chronic pain of which I'm still dealing with. Anxiety and misery can cause physical pain, they don't tell you that at school 🫩", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767755351.0, "id": "ny4t1f9", "author": "Fun_Property1768"}

They had split on me a few months back, but in a way that also deeply hurt me. We've gone on multiple conflicts, back-and-forth serious talks, and communications on how to be better with each other. I have DID, so we do have to learn how to coexist in a different way than the usual.\n\nI won't get into it much, but what happened left such a deep wound within me that despite it being months or weeks, no matter what I do and no matter how much I really, really do understand their reasons - it won't stop hurting. They aren't a bad person, and since then they have apologised and sent me some genuine letters about how much they do love me as a friend and want to keep working on our friendship.\n\nI know a big part of this is because they do feel genuinely regretful and there is also a very reasonable fear that they will lose me. I want to admit that I have been considering drifting away, but I really do want to understand this.\n\nSo my question exactly; what do you wish you could tell your friends? It could be anything.

While I love the idea of ALWAYS having someone around I have come to realize, especially after exiting an emotionally and verbally abusive relationship of 25 years with an (eventually) diagnosed narcissist, that its not actually GOOD for me to live with my romantic partner. I utterly lose myself, likely because I have BPD and therefore not a great sense of self to begin with\n\n  \nRealizing this... I don't feel it's \"right\" or \"Ethical\" to tell my partner what to do in their free time in their own space. Control isn't rooted in love, it's rooted in envy or jealousy. I have to have really, REALLY clear boundaries for myself regarding things like this because of the BPD. So If I'm honest about the fact that I don't want to live with my partner, I can't tell them what to do otherwise by my own boundaries. So my partner is married to another woman and spends about 50% of his time with me, which is great because I also live with my two older teenagers and I work a LOT and I have hobbies. After my last relationship, I don't feel great being observed while engaging in my hobbies because my ex would often mock them or get bent out of shape that I was paying attention to something that wasn't him. So I can do those when my partner isn't around and when he IS around it's nearly ALL intentional time. It's kind of great. Only issue is he's my FP. That causes a few problems but so far not too many. Honestly it stops me from splitting or causing other issues because the alone time gives me time to decompress and process things. \n\nAnyway, your feelings are valid and your decision are quite prudent.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767715057.0, "id": "ny0xyj2", "author": "BPD_trash_panda"}

She was diagnosed in 2023 with BPD, depression and anxiety. She started therapy (I believe DBT phase 1) and ever since she became better, along with taking her meds. However, last year was really though on her mentally and she ended up having a psychotic episode in October. We took her to a mental health hospital where she stayed for 3 days. From there, everything went downhill, she says she barely remembers the experience but she knows that she was severely mistreated during her stance, and then it started affecting her short and long term memory, she can't even recall some events that happened months before the psychotic episode.\n\nShe's been dealing with intrusive thoughts, emotional blocking, impulsivity, aversion towards physical touch, panic attacks, meltdowns, she can't talk about her feelings or state without shutting down, she has constant nightmares about the hospital, she says she feels hypervigilant all the time, always on alert, her body is tense all the time and hurts, she has constant headaches too. Yesterday she had her first appointment with someone who is specialized in both BPD and PTSD and that's where she got her diagnosis along with an explanation of what has been going on in her head and body.\n\nNow, we don't have a lot of money and can only afford 1 monthly session. I know her psych sent her tasks and assignments, but I'm a bit lost and need guide or resources on how to support her through the process.

I have had PTSD to this level before where I didn’t want anyone to touch me and would have panic attacks until I passed out. I think general treatment is therapy and medication. The therapy was exposure therapy. I learned to rate how bad my PTSD was feeling on a scale of 1-10 and had to work on explaining what happened (and even visiting that place physically) until it didn’t affect me anymore. I was not able to speak to anyone not even my parents or anyone at the hospital I was completely shut down. Eventually after many many sessions my therapist told me his grandfather who was raising him was shot and killed right in front of him and I felt safe enough to start working on my trauma with him. Shame and guilt are two of the hardest emotions I have had to process. Learning the DBT emotional regulation module helped a lot, hopefully she will work on that. I’m sorry for what you’re going through I know it is hard to be a partner of a pwBPD when they are lashing out. I had a bit of trauma now from my last mental breakdown so I can understand.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "Okay, this is a long comment but hear me out, cause it's relevant. \n\nI am one year out of a 4 year relationship, and that in and of itself taught me a LOT about me and my BPD. \nI tried putting myself out there like once, but I'm still not in a place to commit. Heartbreak sucks. \n\n A couple Things I learned and how they relate to the 9: \n\n1. Fear of abandonment\n- I have been more willing to stay silent about being mistreated because the thought of losing the person I am in love with is too scary. \"If I speak out and they don't like it they are going to leave me.\"\n\nHow am I working on it? \n- I make a note of a behavior or pattern that makes me uncomfortable, or that I have an emotional reaction to. And then when I have some time to myself I look at it and I breathe and I think in the most \"filtered\" capacity that I can. I ask the questions\n\"What was the feeling? Where havw I felt it before? Is it rational?\"\n\n\n2. Identity\n- I am significantly MORE willing to stretch that \"compromise\" line out more than the other person is willing. I have been guilty of compromising the few parts of my identity and self to benefit the other person. \n\nHow am I working on it? \n- with the time I have had alone, I keep learning what things I used to enjoy and exploring old hobbies and interests and structuring time around doing those and questioning if I really like them or not. Am I liking this hobby because I am doing good at it and it's getting me positive attention? Do I like it for a while and then hate it when I *don't* get positive attention, or criticism?\n\n3. Mood swings \n- a lot of the time, I don't know what I need when I'm feeling, splitting, spiralling, or dissociating. And I don't know how to communicate that.\n\nThis one is harder for me to work on because I simply don't know what I need, and it's a process to figure out. \n\nI would also say that I am a poster girl for \"needy\". I need constant reassurance, I need constant reminders, I need the smallest of gestures. I need lots of physical touch. I need appreciation. I need consistency and to say and hear \"I love you\" all of the time. I need blatant communication, and most importantly I need more patience than someone without BPD. \n\nThe one time I tried to put myself out there I shot out all my red flags first, including my disorder. I am hyper aware of myself and my patterns, and regardless of how hard I work on them, this illness doesn't have a cure. We just have to adapt to the best of our ability. And sometimes that means that when we slip up after a good streak, we split a little harder and feel hopeless because \"omg I was doing so good and now [enter self-hate verbal diarrhea here], but we gotta try to stop the train in its tracks and remind ourselves of the progress we *just* made.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "I don’t even know where to start. Hypersensitivity towards anything I perceive as dislike, disdain, annoyance. “Are you sure you don’t hate me?” “Am I talking too much?” What’s worse is I feel so pathetic asking so often, yet for some reason I just can’t help myself, I need the constant reassurance. I am so quick to cry and I hate it, and during especially heated moments my emotions are so out of control and overwhelming that my brain just shuts down. Or during especially heated moments I’ll be triggered from past relationships and start feeling like I need to protect myself from physical harm. I know my current bf would never do what past partners have done, but it takes one door slam, one yell and I am either hiding in the bathtub or running out of the house. And words never leave my head, during heated moments i know things slip that people don’t mean, but my brain won’t forget them. It’ll stew in me for months, sometimes years and then no matter what, even when he apologizes, he already said it. I know how he truly feels, him saying sorry is only for me to feel better, not because he actually means it.  \nI also value quality time, to a most likely unhealthy degree. If more than 3 days go by without us seeing each other I start to slip, my mood shifts down and I’m more irritable. My whole life I’ve always been the one left out, it’s just one of the many things that have shaped me, and I’ve convinced myself over the years that it’s fine for me to be ignored and mistreated because one day I’ll find the person who loves me and who will be with me all the time. Unrealistic? Absolutely. But something I clung to for years. I love my bf and i know he loves me, so why is it this one section of my brain will poison my thoughts the second I decide it’s been too long since we have seen each other? I hate that it happens, but I can’t stop, and i cry and i drink and i do whatever to escape the crushing feeling of how insanely lonely I am. And despite them knowing the state I am in, also knowing there is nothing I can do that will make them come be with me. And after so many occurrences my brain just “accepts” that this is how things are. \n“It’s not that he doesn’t love you, you’re just so much to handle and deal with so he needs space from you.” (This is exactly how my mind speaks to me, like another person is in there talking to me, but it’s me. And normally not as nice lol. And I’ll have a full conversation, WITH MYSELF IN MY HEAD, dissecting how us going a whole weekend not seeing each other means and how I am responsible). Which of course, leads right directly to my self hate train, “i wouldn’t want to see myself either but here i am stuck with myself” “if he actually cared about me and how i was feeling he would be here, he would do something to prove he loves me, but if i know he loves me, but he isn’t coming, knowing how i am, then im just draining him. If i keep being this way he will leave me”. Which of course then brings us to me distancing myself, hardly texting or calling because it’s too painful for me, knowing no matter what i do or say, he won’t come for me. So then i waste the day away, laying in my bed thinking about how unlovable i am, and if we do text, i refuse to speak on any thoughts or feelings i have because I know it’ll just lead to an argument and he will feel bad and then I’ll feel guilty for saying anything at all. And if we argue then I’ll cry or blow up and then deal with the SH thoughts and ideation alone. \nHe will tell me that we belong together, he is mine and I am his and we can get through all the hard moments together. But he isn’t really mine, and i think that’s where my whole issue comes into play. I can’t just take him with me everywhere, i cant hug him when i want, or go to the movies or have a good cry when i need it. He has his own life, completely separate from me, his own issues and passions he’s pursuing. So how could he be mine? And i know it’s selfish, i know it’s wrong to have these thoughts. But why does it feel like im just not important enough to show up for? I’ve tried communicating my feelings but it just makes him feel so bad, he feels like he isn’t doing enough but he isnt acknowledging what i already know, i want too much. And then all i feel is resentful for ever trying to talk about my feelings in the first place. It is always my fault anyways, I’ll be upset about something and the root cause is something i did. I feel like i want more than anyone would ever be willing to give. Especially for someone as insane as me. \n\nSorry for any typos, on my phone and it is 1:37am - not a goodnight but fingers crossed i can actually sleep", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767771441.0, "id": "ny5v4ie", "author": "SadOrangesandMangoes"}

Pls help 🥺\n\nHey everyone, \n\nI’ve been feeling weird lately. I got officially diagnosed about a month ago and tbh I was really relieved when I received the diagnosis. \nI’ve spent the better part of the last 10-15 years telling people including mental health professionals that I think something’s wrong with me and that I think I might have bpd only to be dismissed because of my adhd diagnosis I received as a child. \n\nIn mid 2025 I started working with a new therapist and I absolutely love her but even then it felt like I had to fight for her to keep working towards a diagnosis because I went to her explicitly stating „I need to know what’s wrong with me and don’t you dare tell me I have depression because that’s not helped me in the slightest“ \n\nThen in early December I finally receive the bpd diagnosis out of the blue and I was so relieved. \nWe even went through the dsm-v criteria together and after every bullet point went „yep 😅“ after reading it out. \n\nHow come I’m now doubting my own diagnosis and finding things in my behaviour that don’t align with the stereotypical bpd picture and I feel like I basically gaslit myself and everyone around me into thinking I have it? \n\nLike, I’m never aggressive. I don’t „lash out“ at people and call them names when I’m splitting. \nI don’t get angry with them when I fear they’ll leave me but rather try to cling onto them and beg them to stay and, most importantly, beg them to do/be what I need from them.\n\nIt’s never been „I love you/you’re the worst person ever“ . It’s more a „I finally found people who love me and will stay“ turning into „I’m so disappointed why are you treating me like this and why are you leaving now just like everybody else? Why am I so easy to throw away like a used paper towel?“ \n\nI don’t physically self harm that much. Last year I started scratching myself after I was assaulted in my sleep as a means to both ground myself during an episode and punish myself for acting up and generally hating my body.\nI’m not a „cutter“ tho. Never have been. I guess my non existent pain tolerance saved my ass a lot. \n\nI don’t know if this is common and the common perception of bpd is just so skewed that it’s not accurate to what it’s actually like to live with bpd or if I went into a completely wrong direction in terms of trying to figure out what’s going on with me and I did it with such confidence that I’m now too embarrassed to admit it. \n\nAnyways thanks for listening ", "score": 1, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1767790203.0, "id": "1q6eiqr", "author": "wolfpack3d", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1q6eiqr/i_worked_hard_for_my_diagnosis_and_now_i_feel/"}

I was diagnosed last year as well and sometimes seeing other people talk about their experiences that I can’t personally relate to confuses me. Honestly though if you meet all the criteria sometimes it shows up differently and that can be just because of your individual personality or other things. Like I am probably more of a “quiet bpd” person; I also don’t lash out and although I do split on people and have problems with all my social relationships, it would be more difficult to tell I’m disordered (with bpd at least) unless we’re close because I internalize most things.

This obsessive crush could be for someone in real life or someone online (a content creator). I already feel embarrassed typing this because I know it's not healthy and it makes me feel like a freak. I will idolize the person so hard, constantly watch their content, or look at their Instagram. My mind will constantly be preoccupied with thoughts about them, I will fantasize about us having a life together, and even think about what I can do to myself to make myself more appealing to them. It’s gotten to a point where I will watch a content creator that I’m obsessed with and use the information in their post to pinpoint the general location where they live. I do want to preface that I would never show up at someone’s house or follow them around in real life. The furthest this has ever gone is me hard-core fantasizing about moving to their cities so I could run into them. I hate that I am like this, I know it's extremely unhealthy. I even think back to my last relationship with my ex, he was my “favorite person”. I idolized him and just wanted him to love and accept me so badly. I seriously would try to do anything to please him and I lost myself in that relationship. I’ll never forget the day when he told me I needed to dress a certain way and I didn’t even think twice. (he was obviously controlling so that didn’t help.) I apologize for the long rant. I just want to know that I am not a total freak and that someone else has struggled with this or currently struggles with this. I know I need behavioral therapy, and have for a long time.

In my case, the woman he cheated on me with was also married so im sure *one* of them is eventually going to do the same thing again. Thier relationship is built on betrayal and im sure you're right, it is not going to work out. \nI've found someone new who treats me great but it has been hard not letting my insecurities from the past affect us. I'm trying my best and he has been. So patient with me ❤️", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767757041.0, "id": "ny4y053", "author": "Reasonable-Back7792"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "Oh man… OP I was the cheater! The situation sounds different but kind of the same, I had a special friend I couldn’t let go of, and when my relationship was on the rocks and my mental health was in the gutter special friend said everything will be fine if you marry me so I said okay like a dumbass, and I was so overwhelmed with emotions and fear and novelty I thought I was in love but it was obsession. I tried so hard to get my man back I did everything under the sun but he decided not to forgive me and said he never wants to speak to me again or see me ever again. Trying not to kms and move on. It’s going okay, it’s just hard. Cheating is a horrible thing.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767758014.0, "id": "ny50qo3", "author": "Nataliant-117"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BPD", "text": "Ahh I see, i understand this perspective as well. Im not perfect and when I was with my high school sweetheart I did cheat on him. I felt like I wasnt getting the attention I wanted from him and this other guy was willing to give that to me. Then I realized it was just lust and not love. We all make mistakes. This I understand. But it is no longer just a mistake when you get called out for what you're doing and instead of admitting it and apologizing, you gaslight and lie. Like to this day he still hasn't admitted it to me himself.i found out through other sources. He decided to die on the hill that they're \"just friends\" like I wouldnt see thier pics on PUBLIC social media 😂\nIt sounds like youve taken accountability though and have tried to apologize. Unfortunately thats all you can do, you cannot control other people and their decisions. However, I would suggest trying to forgive yourself as well. You do not need thier forgiveness to forgive yourself. Take it as a learning opportunity for future relationships and be a better you!", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767758656.0, "id": "ny52i11", "author": "Reasonable-Back7792"}
