She reaches out very rarely—usually after she’s done talking to other people or when she needs something. Because of that, I eventually started replying coldly and keeping conversations short, which just made things feel even more distant.\n\nRecently, she asked if I was upset with her. I was, but I didn’t reply. It’s been over ten days now. What bothered me most was that there was no follow-up—no call, no second message, nothing. It felt like she asked just to be able to say she asked.\n\nShe often replies hours later or maybe sometimes days, sometimes ignores messages even after clearly seeing them, and keeps everything vague. I know she talks to a lot of people, and it makes me feel like I’m just another option on her list rather than someone she actually values.\n\nShe calls me a friend, but this doesn’t feel like friendship to me. There’s no consistency, no effort, and no clarity. I tried matching her energy, but I don’t like who I become when I do that.\n\nNow I’m considering ending contact—not out of anger, but because I’m tired of feeling optional and unsure of where I stand. At the same time, I’m questioning myself: am I expecting too much from her? Are these normal expectations in a friendship, or am I emotionally over-invested because I care more than she does?\n\nShe might be a good person overall, but the way she treats me makes this feel pointless.\n\nAm I missing something here? Is this just a mismatch in communication styles? Or is walking away the healthier choice?\n\n&gt; **Edit**: I’m not looking to confront her or force anything. I just want to understand whether my expectations are unreasonable or if this situation is simply not worth continuing.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768053021.0, "id": "1q94jmg", "author": "Ill-Insect-3499", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q94jmg/am_i_wrong_for_walking_away_when_someone_treats/"}

But now I am trying to make new friends and possibly trying to date someone.\n\nI made a lot of female friends but it seems like none of them are actually interested in me romantically.

Why is that ?** What I deduced is that because I used to help people often and often times these random people would just left me after gaining help from me. And this is now triggering me with a constant loop of insecurity. \n\nAnother issue that I am facing is that, I want to have a pretty girlfriend, I do not know why I want love or a girlfriend, but I am being desperate for Love and attention.

Even minor sensations could spiral into worry. It was exhausting, and I didn’t realize how much mental energy it was taking from me.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements came when I stopped fighting my anxiety and started understanding it. I learned that anxiety isn’t a weakness—it’s my mind trying to protect me, even when there’s no real danger. Accepting this helped me respond more calmly instead of panicking.\n\nTaking care of my mental health now means building simple, consistent habits. I focus on proper sleep, slowing my breathing when my thoughts race, and avoiding excessive symptom-checking. Grounding myself in the present moment has helped me feel more in control.\n\nMost importantly, I’ve learned to be kinder to myself. Progress isn’t linear, and some days are harder than others. But choosing patience, self-compassion, and small daily improvements has helped me move toward a healthier and more balanced mindset.\n\nThanks for reading.  \n— **Ankita Yadav**", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768040812.0, "id": "1q90scy", "author": "iampotato05", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q90scy/learning_to_take_care_of_myself/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "Getting frustrated easily", "text": "Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit because I'm not sure which one to post it on, but I want to improve on this issue in my life.\n\nI'm not really sure how to explain it, so I'll give an example of what happened today morning.\n\nMy sibling and grandparents are currently staying over at my parents' house, where I live, for the winter holidays. My sibling arrived from the airport this morning and everyone was talking, catching up, and what not. I'm not super close with my family, so I didn't really participate much, but after a while when everyone was talking in the living room, I got up to sit on the table alone because I randomly got annoyed. I didn't like how loud they were talking, I didn't like the touch contact I felt when everyone was sitting squished up on the couch, I didn't like that there was music playing in the background, I didn't like that the TV was on in the background. I became really aware of how much clothes feel and got annoyed at that. I just got really frustrated randomly with the whole situation and wanted everyone to stop everything and leave, because I wanted to be alone? I listened to music on my earphones to block them out while I sat on the table, but they would sometimes call for me or ask me while they were having conversations and I just wanted to ignore them and leave. They didn't do anything wrong, for some reason I just wanted to shut down. So I sat at the table blasting music in my ears to distract myself/ disassociate and block everything out, I guess. My dad came to sit with me at the table with his laptop to get some work done and started talking to me, but I got frustrated and left into another room. When I left to go to the other room, I could still hear everything from the living room, the cutlery sounds, the laughing, the conversations, which made me annoyed and angry. People kept coming into the room to talk to me about something but it just keeps making me annoyed that I can't be left alone to recollect my thoughts and feelings in my head that I get annoyed and angry but also feel like crying?\n\nThis whole experience just made me so so irritated. At this moment, I got extremely angry and annoyed, but also felt like crying at the same time? I don't really know, I just wanted a place where I could be alone in complete silence without anyone there. Again, my family didn't say anything triggering or something that made me upset, I just randomly wanted everyone to stop talking and laughing and turn off the tv, and just leave me alone. I know I could try to tell them that I just want to be alone, but they always just criticise me that I should spend more time with family and should be grateful and sometimes they make fun of me when I get angry during these situations. I'm not sure why I always feel like this. I then start to get annoyed and feel like breaking down at little things when I'm not able to be alone and calm down from the situation.\n\nThis happens quite often and I'm not really sure why, so I wanted to know is theres a reason for this, and if so, is there a way I can stop getting randomly irritated in these situations? I'm not sure if this is what people call a sensory overload, but I'm not diagnosed with any neurodivergence. I looked into stuff like ADHD and autism, and I do fit a decent amount of criteria, BUT I have not been diagnosed, or even contacted anyone who would be qualified to diagnose me, and I'm not self diagnosing. I'm just trying to figure out why I feel like the situation I described above so often.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768027301.0, "id": "1q8x3at", "author": "warmpeppermintt", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q8x3at/getting_frustrated_easily/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "How can I work on my self identity?", "text": "First off, a little context of my situation. This is very personal post I will make. I am struggling with a lot of things lately. I was born with a condition limits my sight and my hearing. It does limits my independence in some way. I always suffered from low self exteem. From every thing about me. For my education which I was on special education and was a illiterate that could not both languages(spanish and english)  until my late preteen I came to be more literate. I also do not like my sexuality which is being bisexual or being into macrophilia ( into giants) because its complicates my sexual experience. Though I don't have much sexual experience neither. I lived overprotected by my christian puerto rican mom. I also depend on my parents and live in their house even when I graduated with a degree of mechanical engineering. I am also into deep emotional crisis with my racial identity because of difference of hispanic/anglo view of race and been questioning many things about my culture. I am unemployed for 1 year and five months. I am growing more desesperate and beginning to doubt about myself and feeling disappointed. I am doubting if I am even worth to be call a man or a human. My situation is somewhat atypical and feel trapped, powerless and useless. I never felt this way. I was not always like this. I also give too much importance on what people think of me and other says. That was something it was more moderate in my younger years. There is my mom cancer that hit me hard and I pretend to be like anything is ok. But it shaken my world very aggressively. I am not necesarially mentally ok. I went to a psychiatric hospital for one week. I also failed friendships and harmed people. I just fail like a total weird and lower guy and horrible person. I cannot bring myself to be confident or like myself. I also self sabotage as a form of punishment or harm myself to mentally or physically out of hate of myself. Only thing that keep my mind intact are the pills from therapy,  working out or drawing. But the thing is I developed a dependence for drawing and my self esteem is tied to it. If I dont do it I spiral in self hate and anger at myself. It gotten pretty toxic. I don't like my body neither nor my face even though I am trying to improve it. All of this can be sum up to just having deep self hatred , lack of porpuse , lack of direction and existential crisis. For now, I don't know what else to do to improve all these issues or at least be more healthy mentally, physically, socially , emotionally. How can I bring up more self esteem and regain my confidence? Have a healthier relationship with myself? I would gladly hear your ideas as I am without any ideas what I can do on this moment.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "Yes: mainstream porn is structurally made for the male gaze, and not just “male” in some neutral sense, but a domineering, performance-driven, extractive one. It trains attention toward conquest, escalation, and visual control. There is very little in it that reflects how healthy femininity actually experiences sexuality,not as display, but as steering reception, pacing, mystery, attunement, containment, and nurture.\n\nWhat *is* present in porn, overwhelmingly, is unresolved male trauma: patriarchy turned into choreography. Anxiety about adequacy, fear of intimacy, dread of passivity, terror of being irrelevant , externalized as thrust, volume, novelty, and domination. Because patriarchy is so totalizing, and because almost every kid now encounters porn before they have language or counter-models, it’s easy to mistake this hyper-stimulated fragment for “what sex is.” It isn’t. It’s closer to a slot machine: intermittent reward, escalating novelty, dopamine without regulation.\n\nGood sex doesn’t start with friction. It starts with safety. With long, almost boring cuddling. With nervous systems synchronizing before bodies do anything impressive. That’s true for men and women alike, regardless of orientation. Porn is not sex; it’s a prosthetic for isolation. An anesthetic when there’s no one around. Sometimes useful, often corrosive, especially when mistaken for a teacher.\n\nporn has quietly functioned as a mass trauma-transfer device: one generation’s unprocessed fear about intimacy handed to the next as spectacle. . Flattened desire. Confused arousal. Difficulty tolerating slowness, ambiguity, or emotional presence.\n\nTake from that what you will, but don’t confuse saturation for truth, or stimulation for intimacy.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1768009547.0, "id": "nyplb98", "author": "BothLeather6738"}

To be able to live freely, do what you like and how you like, it is essential that you are not dependent on any one for your day-to-day life. At a minimum, you should be able to take care of yourself.\n\n1. Cook, to prepare your meals.\n2. Laundry. Every one has a washing machine nowadays so this is not a skill but still you need to know how to use it. Treating fabric and maintaining routine is still a part of self care and home management.\n3. Cleaning. Maintaining a clean and tidy environment directly affects your physical and mental well being.\n\nBeyond survival skills, there is another important requirement - how you spend your time. \n\nYou will have plenty of free time for yourself.  You need to have a hobby so that you do not bore yourself to death and keep your physical and mental health in good condition. This could be - \n\n1. Writing\n2. Music (Listening)\n3. Music (Instrument playing)\n4. Art/painting\n5. Photography\n\nThese are just some examples which are very common. You need to do something to keep yourself busy and be constructive. This gives you an identity when you no longer have professional titles or parental responsibilities. This also gives you an opportunity to socialize with like minded people . I think this would be a plus.\n\nIf you are not old and living alone, you still have time to learn skills and develop hobbies.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "How do you learn to respect other people’s boundaries?", "text": "I’m far too old (22 almost 23) to be learning this now, but I’ve noticed over my last two serious relationships that I’m honestly terrible at respecting other people’s boundaries. It’s not something I’m doing on purpose or maliciously but I also know that “oh shit I’m sorry I didn’t mean to” isn’t actually fixing the behavior even if those are words I GENUINELY MEAN when these instances happen. \n\nFor context, in November I got into a relationship with someone who I work with. He is wonderful, fantastic, sexy as hell, and treats me like a princess. But, he has made it very clear that he doesn’t want to flirt at work. I am realizing just how terrible I am at following this boundary that he has set. \n\nJust the other night (had to be less than a week) we had this big talk about how he feels bad because he feels like he has been stonewalling me at work and feels like it’s been affecting our relationship. We talked about the fact that he genuinely cares about me and doesn’t want me to pull away because of it and about how it’s because he wants to keep work and home life separate and that he just wants to be able to focus on work while he’s working. None of that was unreasonable. \n\nHere I am today and I see him pick up something heavy and it got me thinking about him in a really flirty way and so I started texting him what I was thinking hoping that it would be a little infectious. Instead all I got was laughing emojis and it hurt my feelings honestly. I think twice I kinda made a joke about it, nothing mean or backhanded or anything, just like “ya know laughter wasn’t the reaction I was looking for there ;)”. And like the second time I saw how pretty his eyes are and started talking about how I was drowning in them and he just said “no” and even then I kept pushing it because I was caught up in the moment and trying to be playful with him. It wasn’t something I had even thought about until long after we had that conversation and it wasn’t meant to be malicious or disrespectful or pushy. \n\nI later realized that the texting was crossing the boundary and apologized over text because we were still at work. He apologized for being standoffish and I told him that it’s completely understandable to have a negative reaction when someone is pushing your boundaries. BECAUSE IT IS! It wasn’t until after we got off work that I even remembered/realized that I had also just blatantly flirted with him which was YET ANOTHER boundary cross and what he was probably actually talking about in his response to my apology. \n\nHe seems to be understanding that this is something I’m having a hard time getting used to, but he shouldn’t have to be. I should be able to just respect his desire not to be flirted with at work. And like I have some follow up questions about the details of the boundaries but it also feels like asking them is just going to come across as “how can I get as close to your boundaries as possible without actually crossing them?” \n\nI know that this is a skill I should already have learned by now. I really don’t want to lose him over this and I think that I might still have time to fix this behavior before it sabotages something that makes me so happy. I want to be a better person overall which I guess is why I’m trying to see if anyone has advice on how to do better. Obviously “just don’t do it” isn’t enough because if it was that easy for me this wouldn’t be a problem, and I worry that I can’t just fix it overnight. \n\nTL;DR How do I learn to respect other people’s boundaries when I’m impulsive and am not very good at thinking before I act?

But then it got worse and worse like the way he acted towards me, Especially when he got a boyfriend in late nov. \n\nHe came home for Christmas break and we barely hung out, it was weird. Because I thought that this break would be fun because he always sees his friends at college so now he can finally see me. Well that wasn’t the case. \n\nMy break is over and I told him about how I felt. And he apologized but he also needed to tell me that he was leaving space for me to be my own person because if he left I would be alone, but the thing is that he’s never said that, when we sat at lunch alone, when we hung out together all summer, he never once said that. And I think he is saying that because he wants more time to be with his new boyfriend. Which is insane… betraying someone you consider your best friend for a boyfriend is insane. \n\nSo ive decided that im done, I can’t do it anymore.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "Discernment and Clarity: How to Know Which Self-Help Advice to Follow?", "text": "When you’re, you’re down, and everyone can tell.  People send all these little bits of advice your way, assuming the exact thing that helped them will help you in exactly the same way.  It’s usually little one-liners about motivation, positive thinking, acceptance, or maturity.  Sometimes, people write entire books full of these notions and make a lot of money selling them to those who are struggling.  Maybe you read some of those books or just saw some memes about them.  But nothing changed.  You’re still sick all the time.  You still cant get out of bed.  Why?  What is wrong?\n\nI have an ex-roommate who has spent his entire adult life at age 35 chasing one self-help program after another, trying to hack his way out of the pain and misery of the human condition.  First it was New Age spirituality, meditation, psychedelics, and raw veganism.  Then it was organic food and the P90x workout routine.  Then it was Hustlers University and vitamin supplements.  He’s still a mess and totally miserable.  None of this worked for him, and most of it hurt him pretty badly.\n\nI recently saw my old friend again after over 10 years apart.  His life has not moved forward at all.  His life is in terrible shape, he is confused as ever, and this is not about to change anytime soon.  It made me wonder how many other people are making similar mistakes.  This world is a confusing place.  When you are struggling, it can be nearly impossible to tell which advice will actually help you instead of wasting your time.  There are not enough years in the human lifetime to try every path and see where it leads.  And opening too many wrong doors will exhaust your energy, bring misfortune into your life, and depress you further.  But you have to try something.  You can’t just sit there.  You’ve got to pick a direction and move in it.  But how?  Who can you trust?  Will this path truly lead to a way out?\n\nFor many people, the correct doors eventually open, and they accidentally find themselves on the other side, forgetting what it ever felt like to be down.  The advice these people give is rotten.  It’s the blind leading the blind.  Anyone who succeeds from their advice either understood it better than the teacher or simply got lucky.  For the rest of us, it’s a search mission for the pieces and a puzzle to put them together.  You have to be able to pick the nuggets of gold out of the mountain of shit that is the advice people offer.  You have to journey far and wide to find the people who understand your mind and your situation better than others and learn from them.  You have to just try things and see what happens.  But you have pay attention, or else you’ll end up like my old friend just blindly following prepackaged programs for a prepackaged person.  You have to create your own self-help philosophy and teach it to yourself.  It might be a combination of two or three things, or it might be a little bit of everything.  This can be one of the hardest things you’ll ever do in your life, but it might just be the most important.\n\nDoes this resonate with anyone?  How would you describe your solution to your depression?  Did you ever take advice that was meant for someone else with a different life than yours?", "score": 2, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1767845035.0, "id": "1q71oq7", "author": "StrictLetterhead3452", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q71oq7/discernment_and_clarity_how_to_know_which/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "I find your analysis really accurate, especially when it comes to the trap of “one-size-fits-all” self-help solutions. A lot of self-improvement discourse assumes there’s a universal method, when in reality the most painful parts of someone’s struggle are often the least visible or hardest to put into words. After trying frameworks that don’t truly fit, people often stop questioning the methods and start doubting themselves instead.\n\nWhat really stands out to me in your post is the idea that the real work isn’t about finding the right answer, but about learning how to recognize what actually resonates with your own experience. It doesn’t sound like your friend lacks effort — it sounds more like he’s been trying to live up to narratives of “success” that were never truly his to begin with.\n\nMaybe getting unstuck isn’t about opening yet another door, but about slowing down enough to understand why certain doors feel so appealing… and why others quietly drain you.

Then he went and told everyone about it as if it were funny, although he tried to apologize, but then he took it all as a joke.\n\n\nFinally, the last friend, Tiziano, who never did anything to me. He listens, he's a good guy. The only annoying thing is that sometimes, to impress women, he tries to make jokes or comments that make you uncomfortable and leave you looking bad. Even so, if you talk about it, it gets resolved.\n\n\nMy problem is that I'm the only one in the group who no longer feels comfortable, and I don't know what to do. I tried to explain, but I can't make my best friend understand that what happened with my ex really bothered me, because he thinks my problem is only with the other two in the group. I broke up with this girl a long time ago, almost a year, but some things are hard to heal. And I feel like they won't take me seriously when I talk to them, first because I don't have the courage, and second because that already happened about 8 months ago and I kept it to myself.\n\n\n\nI'd like the group to regain trust, but I don't know.\n\nI feel bad, angry, furious. I'd like to be able to vent, but this time I want them to take me seriously.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767829714.0, "id": "1q6vv4m", "author": "Professional_Two7685", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q6vv4m/should_i_leave_my_friends_behind_to_get_ahead/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "Over the years I've found a few things happen with friendships:\n\n1. You outgrow some of them - sometimes you just grow apart, find joy in different things, or have different values  \n2. You adjust your boundaries - you realise that some people can't be trusted with a secret, and you also realise that sharing secrets with friends is something you do much less of in general (because it usually has no upside, but can go very wrong) unless you want advice or to talk through something. Gossip and secrets are exciting until they become exhausting and petty. These days I avoid talking about other people unless I have something nice to say about them.  \n3. Some get deprioritised - you find friends that are a better fit for you in terms of interests and values, and you put more focus and effort on those, which naturally results in the other friendships cooling off\n\nSo you basically don't need to make any dramatic announcements or adjustments. Just be realistic about what each of your friends are good for (e.g. hanging out, studying together, etc.) and what they are bad for (e.g. talking about emotionally-sensitive topics), and try to always be open to making new friends as you may meet people you click with better.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767841000.0, "id": "nybtltr", "author": "nooneinparticular246"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "I could use some help figuring out who I am. Thank you", "text": "Hello Reddit.  \n\nPosting this on a \"throw away\" as the biggest reason is I’m not sure what will happen with this post. I also hope that I am posting in an approved location. Please note my grammar and/ or punctuation might not be the best (yes English is my only language but doesn’t mean I’m good at it XD) \n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about this as I hear about reddit stories when I’m listening to videos and I was wondering if it could help. I’m not really sure what it is that I’m looking for, maybe some help trying to figure out who/ what I am or can do. To help you guys as my mind tends to be a bit random unless I actually have structure, I have labeled the paragraphs. Feel free to read them in any order, but please read them all as that is what I had intended when I made the post. \n\nMe \n\nI am white male 35, 6’3” built kinda like a strong man (muscularish with a bit of a belly that makes me solid). Hair thinned a bit, but still have most of it. I do have grey streaks due to my mental issues causing early graying. I have severe anxiety, panic disorder, severe depression, and autisim (I might have adhd to but never bothered to get diagnosed for it, least not yet). I wasn’t diagnosed properly until adulthood for the autisim. I am by no means a catch (yes I still have my v card), and harbor no ill will towards anyone (more later). \n\nBackground \n\nI have a long bad history but will try to keep it as brief and vague as I can. I have lost both parents in the past 15 years as well as my baby sister. I have also had legal issues with my still living sister about 15 years ago, but we have long since made up. It was a physical fight between the 2 of us. I went to jail for a day, probation and anger management. I worry our past may be something that stops me from being in a relationship amongst other reasons (more later). \n\nSexuality \n\nHere is one of the things that I could use some help/ advise on so I at least know what I am. I know that it is a spectrum, but much like my mental I’m not sure where I fall. Not having either of my parents around (mainly my dad) makes it hard to have anyone to talk to. When I was younger my mom, I'm sure by accident, made the topic between us a bit uncomfortable to discuss with her, or anyone. My mom, sisters and I were watching the movie Titanic (in my early teens) and when the sketch scene came up she just mentioned to us that she bet that scene made me a bit uncomfortable. I didn’t know why, asked why, reason was mentioned and at the time I just thought ok. Looking back I realize it might have caused some of my current issues. I do like women, I’m pretty sure anyway. I have had crushes in the past on women (yes they were white as well), and still have one on a woman to a degree (she is with someone, and I believe in monogamy so that is nothing I want to get into). I do like their front bumper as it were, but their downstairs does scare me a bit (this is why I’m not sure what I am). I have been hit on by men but was not interested. Yes when I watch adult movies I do watch regular, women only, or hentai. Yes I would imagine this past sentence will get me judged, but I figured it might help you guys help me.  \n\nFamily \n\nI have lost a good chunk of family including the previously mentioned immediate as well as multiple other members. The family I have left is highly religious and has certain expectations for me as I have the family name. The parts that make me worry about this is they frown upon women with unnatural hair color, or mixed-race couples. There are other things as well, but these are the ones that would affect me. Yes I know it shouldn’t, but I don’t have a ton of family left and don’t want to run off or cause issues with that of which I do. I am religious to a degree (I believe that there is some kind of higher power out there, though whom that is I don’t know). I’m also not sure were they stand on premarritals, but I know at lease one of them got divorced and remarried. My mother was my father’s only to the best of my knowledge. Not sure about before marriage or not.  \n\nI’m sure there will be mean comments but hopefully some helpful ones as well. If questions, I will try to update or edit.

Simple moments like waiting in line, walking or sitting alone for a minute felt extremely hard to do nothing. I always had that FOMO, so I would often check my phone in those times.\n\nSo I stopped trying to “use my phone less” and tried to fix my attention instead. I started watching podcasts (Cal Newport) and reading books (Dopamine Nation) that helped me get some ideas and methods to combat this addiction I had.\n\nFirst thing, no phone for the first hour after waking up. No scrolling, no msgs, no news. Just coffee, moving around, letting my brain boot up. First week sucked. After that, mornings felt way less chaotic luckily.\n\nSecond, I only pick up my phone for one reason. If I open it to reply to someone, I reply and put it down. No reward scroll after. Sounds stupid but this one broke the autopilot loop hard.\n\nThird, I replaced fast dopamine with slower stuff. Long walks with no podcast. Music without doing anything else. Writing random thoughts instead of checking apps. Way less exciting, but my brain calmed the fck down.\n\nFourth, I got clear on what I actually want to work toward. Once I had something real to build, scrolling felt way less tempting. Using stuff like Notion app and Purposa app helped me organize goals and focus on real progress.\n\nFifth, I pushed all the fun to night time. If I wanna scroll or watch dumb videos, fine. Just not all day. Knowing it’s there later makes it easier to not reach for it constantly.\n\nAt first everything felt boring as shit. Then slowly focus came back and now I can concentrate easily (obviously in tasks that I like haha)\n\nDon’t think I am monk now and I don’t scroll anymore. I still scroll sometimes. I still waste time. But now my phone feels like a tool again, and that’s a relief for me. That alone changed way more than any productivity trick I ever tried.\n\nWhat methods actually helped you use your phone less and use it in a more productive way? Would love to hear your methods/tools/apps!\n\nHope this helps you as it did for me, I wish all of you the best in this 2026!", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767820251.0, "id": "1q6rspa", "author": "Mammoth-Car3183", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q6rspa/how_i_stopped_getting_distracted_by_everything_to/"}

I've become \"friends\" with a lot more people, but there's never been that same connection. There's been people I've known and spoke to regularly every day now for 6 years, and I still couldn't hold a conversation with for more than 5 minutes without running out of things to say. We meet often, but it's just to play videogames, or speak about things we pretend to care about while waiting for something to start. Conversation with anyone just feels like a chore I need to do to be normal or get something from them. \nMy best guess as to why is that I've become a boing person. Since being bullied I've slowly been cutting out my hobbies one by one and failing to start new ones. Now all I do is game, and I'm not even particularly passionate about that either. I'm also not at all impulsive, despite my best efforts. I struggle to overcome my anxieties about going out to events unless I know everything about it a day in advance.\nAnother reason might be that I'm generally pretty awkward when it comes to social interaction. Like everything here it's something I've worked on over the years, and I think I have gotten better (active listening, less social anxiety), but I'm still out of practice after avoiding genuine conversation for so long. I also have a lot of ADHD symptoms. I'm not diagnosed and I've never gotten help, but it would explain a lot about my struggles and make it harder to connect to neurotypical people. \nI guess the main question I want to ask is is this something I CAN overcome by my self? I've never gotten help with mental health, and I'm not really sure how I'd justify it to my healthcare provider or my family. If any of you have been through similar times and recovered, I would really appreciate hearing if and how you recovered. All my relationships have been like this going on 8 years now (I am 18), and at my worst I seriously debate giving up and becoming a social recluse until I figure it all out.\nThank you as well for reading this. I think just opening up about it has helped take a weight off my chest, and obviously I haven't been able to do that because of all of the above...", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767796538.0, "id": "1q6gyj7", "author": "Actual_Ice_7772", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q6gyj7/havent_had_real_connection_since_i_was_10_and_i/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "How do I become okay with people touching my things?", "text": "Hi. I’m a 28F and I realized something about myself and I’d like to change it. I hate when people touch my things! I’ve always known this actually but I recently realized it’s bc it’s never returned in the same condition. \n\nI don’t have a lot of things so I never thought I was materialistic but every single thing I own has a home and if it’s removed it’s so noticeable to me. It makes me anxious when people borrow something, even if I never say no, it’s hard to accept that they’re using it and it won’t be returned as neat or clean as when I loaned it. \n\nFor example my friend 31f used my gel lamp, in the same bag it’s in I have my lamp cord and drill cord (bc the drill doesn’t have a bag) and she didn’t return the drill cord, and I had to go search for it around the house. \n\nLosing things or people taking them give me so much anxiety. \n\nI let my roommate 36f borrow a necklace I got from Ghana, and her cousin 22f came over and roommate let her borrow it and she never gave them back! I had to contact the cousin myself and wait 4 months and I just got them back. And the gold is all faded now. I’m so annoyed. \n\nSame family, a let someone 20M borrow something they needed urgently for a convention and they never brought it back. And it’s expensive! Like who does that? \n\nBut it’s just stuff! Why do I feel this deep anxiety when people ask, and why do I feel annoyed when they prove me right? \n\nFor context. I don’t mind giving, I’m extremely generous - if they’re keeping it. But borrowing???? Hell no please! But I never say no unless they wronged me before. And I’ll say people rarely get a second chance to borrow from me again bc they always fuck it up the first go around. If I love them and don’t want to say no they get lectured until they spitefully give it back in mint condition or they lose interest in asking ever again. \n\nBut ask for any gift and it’s yours - new from the store, not my collection! \n\n\nBut anyway. While writing this post I forgot I wanted to change 😭 but I do. But also this is crazy right like who does these things?!?!?!!!?? Am I even the drama? Just give it back like how you got it. Do I need to change? Or do I need to go harder and never let anyone borrow anything ever again? I just don’t want to be stressed while people are using my things. I want to let it go bc at the end of the day it’s all replaceable. No matter how inconvenient it is to replace. \n\nDamnit I’m mad again!

But I also want to be someone who gives without the anxious feeling of “what if?” \n\nwhen it’s important to me and irreplaceable I’m grown enough to say no. But It’s the small things that really are replaceable that I don’t want to stress over, things that I’m okay with sharing, and would like back in the same condition but it’s fine if it’s a little dirty or more used up.

Realistically, she just left the charger on the table and it got moved to the random cord drawer. So it took some searching but I found it and was able to put it back. And it wasn’t as big of a deal as it felt on my insides. \n\nMaybe my examples were too extreme. But if someone wants to borrow a sweater for example, even if I rarely use it I have this pit in my stomach that I’ll never get it back. And it’s just a sweater! I think if I were to let some things go, other things would hold more weight. For example the earrings from Kenya. Yes, I have so so many from Kenya but those meant something and if they had taken another pair I would’ve been EQUALLY as sad but I don’t think I should be. Idk if this is making any sense.

I would say I broadly don't have any positive qualities. I have spent the past year achieving things I've never done before (made close friends; going out and socialize basically every day; going to be getting my bachelors and masters at 21; and am doing fine in my classes; joined a fraternity and started volunteering/giving back to my community more; started building my career and have an engineering internship).\n\nDespite changing my life by real metrics, none of it makes me happy. I think day-to-day I'm slightly happier than I was a few years before, but macro-scale I don't feel much happier. I think I still have to improve a lot; I feel like all my friends probably secretly hate me and I can't imagine making friends in an enviorment less protracted than college. I think I'm still quite stupid and unlikable.\n\nI don't really understand where to take my self improvement journey anymore. I know I hate my personality and who I am, but I can't articulate why anymore. I used to be able to point to qualities about myself I needed to change, but I can't anymore.\n\nI don't really believe in therapy and self-love rhetoric. I believe that if I became a person of value and comparable to my peers, I would become happy. Everyone else I know was born with value(I would say nearly everyone my age is basically a perfect human being), and I don't have any value at 19, so I'm nearly 20 years behind everyone else.\n\nI want to gain positive qualities and improve, but I'm lost at this point. I don't know where to go and what to do to become a better person. Here are some things I have tried:\n\nJournaling: Doesn't really make me feel any different.\n\nExercise: I run off-and-on, usually I end up running a few times a week during spring/summer and then almost completely stopping in the winter (which is bad, I know). During the months where I am running every week for 10+ weeks, I don't feel any happier. I go out to run for a few hours a week and just get upset because my times are bad. Seeing them improve doesn't make me happy either.\n\nTherapy: I don't believe in therapy. I want to improve myself, not be told to love myself or cope. I can't really talk about my self-improvement journey with people in real life because they turn the conversation to these concepts (self-love, \"chilling out\", trying to convince me I'm somehow fine)\n\nVolunteering: I volunteer a few hours a month. I feel obligated to do it, but it doesn't really evoke any feeling in me. It's just one of those things everyone has to do.\n\nSocialization / Going Out More: I attend a few clubs regularly and hang out with my friends basically every day. I like doing this and I think it's the main reason I'm happier day-to-day, but it doesn't really make me feel better about myself long-term.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1767790892.0, "id": "1q6erft", "author": "SchemeEuphoric4565", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q6erft/lost_on_where_to_take_self_improvement_journey/"}

In the past 3 years, I’ve been in a total of 10 relationships, all 3 months plus, and often overlapping with each other. I feel that the only reason I pursue and get into these relationships is because I constantly seek validation, whether it’s romantic or not.\n\nNot to say I don’t love the girls I date, because to be fair, out of the 10, I would say I genuinely loved 5, including the one I’m dating right now. But it’s like the same constant pattern: for the first 2 months, I love this person and think they’re amazing and that they are the ones who are going to break me out of this cycle. Then I end up feeling unfulfilled in the relationship and start to look for other sources of validation, and the cycle continues.\n\nThis is extremely unfair on the girls, and I do understand that, but it feels like I can’t stop. I’m feeling the same way with the girl I’m currently with, where we’re about to hit 6 months, and I just feel unfulfilled in the relationship. I feel like I could invest my time into way more productive things instead of constantly chasing girls/validation. But this girl I’m with is genuinely an amazing person, and I’m scared that I’m going to hurt her by wanting a breakup, especially because she’s been through some stuff and is still going through some.\n\nI still want to stop this pattern because it’s starting to affect my sports, grades, and most importantly, my self-image and mental health.\n\nI know I’m a dick, so I don’t need other people to tell me that. I just need advice on how to break the cycle (be as harsh as you need to be).\n\nSide note: This post is a bit all over the place as I was typing this feeling very overwhelmed and in a rush, so please bear with me.

I’ve been in your shoes before hand, and let me tell you that seeking validation from chasing women or other people will NEVER fix what you’re feeling. It will just be a vicious cycle of idealizing people and pleasing them for the praise and appreciation you’ll get back - but that will just teach your cognition that people have to respond in some type of way whenever you’re being resourceful or helpful. What I found out to help me is to set up some boundaries and look for relationships that allow me to be myself unapologetically. Most of the times, the reason why your relationships feel miserable after 2 or 3 months is because you’re so over your head and heels over that person and the idea of them that you’re creating inside yourself that you don’t even put up boundaries and just swallow small hints towards stuff that you shouldn’t put up to until it’s deep in like 3-4 months and you’re both going to fight and argue around mundane things. But that doesn’t mean you’re a horrible person and neither should they be.

I was jealous and VERY attached to my mom like real separation anxiety when I was away from her, but our relationship got really complicated when my step dad passed away when i was 11 and my mom became very sick from cancer months after (passed away when I was 16).

The best advice I can offer is to try to find things you're passionate about and then keep yourself busy and distracted with them. Not only will it help keep your mind off of things, but once you're ready for a relationship it'll still be useful because everyone finds someone who is passionate and skilled at something attractive! Also I could just be coping in an unhealthy way so take this with a grain of salt, but I find it's useful to try to avoid things in your life that makes you think about being in a relationship.

Well when my grandma adopted me she adopted me under the name Jeromy G.K(giving me the last name of the man she was married to at that time).. fast forward 2008: she remarries and changed my name to Jeromy H.A.. getting to the problem: I have a social security card under my current name Jeromy H.A. and a Medicaid card to prove who I am. That's it. Well and some jail release paperwork which is not considered a valid form of ID here in Arkansas where I now live. I need an ID so bad so I can get my life on track. Employment, driving, etc. You can have 10 forms of identification but without a birth certificate you ain't getting an ID in Arkansas. Period. So before someone stole all my paperwork outta my tent when I unexpectedly went to jail(also lost 2G in stimulus checks I couldn't cash without an ID.) I had the legal name change paperwork from Jeromy G.K. to Jeromy H.A. and a birth certificate under Jeromy G.K.. That still wasn't enough at the DMV to get an ID because I needed a birth certificate under my current last name. I don't know if there is a birth certificate under my current last name or what. But I went to TX vital and Statistics with my mom and the lady up there basically told me that there is no birth record of a Jeromy G.K. or Jeromy H.A. (which is bull💩) cause I got a picture of the Jeromy G.K. birth certificate. The lady up there pretty much told me I'd have to go back to my BIRTH name Jeromy D.S.. which I dont think I can do because I have multiple felonies in multiple different states. This problem has held me back for so long I'm considering 1 of 2 options (neither do I want to do). 1. Getting a fake ID with my real information on it. Or 2. Committing another felony just to go to Prison so I can get State prison Release papers which are a valid form of ID(NOT COUNTY JAIL). Any advice at all would be helpful.

I get paid cash and none of the equipment is mine and I work under my boss who has rent houses and the equipment. If I go to jail my stuff will undoubtly get pilfered and ran sacked and stole and destroyed. Especially if my dog is not there to guard it. I CANNOT afford to go to jail. I've got a nice solar setup and nice tent and I'm finally getting my gear together and it would set me SOOO far back to have restart my life all over AGAIN.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "The world feels overwhelming right now.  I'm noticing something about how we respond to it that is NOT helpful in the long run.", "text": "I think few will dispute this:  the state of the world lately has felt particularly heavy. The constant uncertainty, the news cycle, a lot of things feeling out of control etc.\n\nA lot of us respond to this overwhelm by avoiding certain challenging conversations. When the external world feels chaotic, it becomes easier to tell ourselves \"now isn't the right time\" to have that difficult conversation with a partner, a family member, a boss,  or even with ourselves about what we actually  need.\n\nI'm not saying we should ignore what's happening in the world. But I see over and over again with the people I work with that addressing the conversations that have been avoided, even the small ones can help us feel less powerless. \n\n***So if you find yourself stuck, ask yourself: what conversation am I avoiding? The answer won't always be easy, but then again, there's not much comfort in being stuck either.***\n\nMaybe it's finally telling someone how you really feel. Maybe it's setting a boundary you've been scared to set. Maybe it's just being honest with yourself about something you've been avoiding.\n\nThe world might be chaotic, but that doesn't mean we have to put our own lives on hold. \n\nIt's one of the few things we can actually control: having the conversation. We don’t necessarily control the outcome, but finding the courage to be honest is one of the things that contribute to genuine and lasting self-confidence.\n\nFinal tip: you can wait until the discomfort becomes unbearable and you have no choice but to have the conversation. Usually that means you could be very tense during the conversation. You don’t have to wait until that point. If you address it earlier, that comes with a more regulated nervous system and a clearer head. Both of these factors have a positive influence on the outcome.\n\nDoes anyone else feel like the global stress has made personal conversations harder?\n\n\n\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767682384.0, "id": "1q5bklp", "author": "DifficultEase9838", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q5bklp/the_world_feels_overwhelming_right_now_im/"}

I am 30F and been in too much depression and despair to really move on with my life, but I have workes on fixing my body, and now wish to work ob more, but I do not know the way as everything feels like a scam these days.\n\nThe key points I am looking at:\n\n-I currently work part-time cleaning and maintenance for assisted living a bit above minimum wage. I barely have enough money to cover rent and grocceries. Its tough and pays low, but I found it was easier to get up for a job that had actual need and meaning, and I do enjoy being able to help people until I find a job I actually enjoy.\n-I do not have a driver's license , I had trouble spacing out, and cannot afford a car to drive, nor the insurance now that I have better focus\n.\n-I wish to find a career so that I may work with wild animals, I enjoy animal behaviouralism+zoology,  and get along with animals I find on walks and hikes, but people dont like to let you near them normally unless you have an occupation with them. I also have an interest in astronomy and meteorology, but I struggle with memorizing vocab and exact numbers(concepts I can get). I also showed an interest in being a death doula due to my comfort with death, but they require paperwork and financial literacy I struggle with\n-I wish to seek education now that I can  focus better, but currently have 10K in student debt when I tried to go back  to college to try to get out of poverty when I wasnt ready (was 2 terms during covid and my mental/emotional health couldnt handle it) ideally I would like to seek education out of the USA somewhere affordable. My grades are not that  great though, I am great at notes and tests, but homework grades always got me.\n-I hold a strong sense of integrity and kindness, even in the face of those being mean. This does make dealing with people a bit exhausting and steessful sometimes. \n\n-I live in a family of 3 with one disabled person in Oregon, USA. We are aiming to move out of the USA ASAP. Likely France\n\nI have a few bodily challenges:\n-I need 8-12 hrs of sleep depending on activity\n-My fingers and wrists hurt with minimal use\n-Pain tolerance/body numbness makes me not notice if my body needs rest or is taking damage until I notice I am not functioning/thinking correctly.\n-Knees/feet are still healing from overuse\n-overstimulated by noise and bright lights\n-ADHD+Memory Issues, I can hyperfocus on special interests though\n-Neurodivergent(I tend  to mask it, but may make me miss social ques)\n-traumatized by paperwork. I can push through when necessary, but a job centered around it is not a wise choice for me.\n\nI understand this is going to be an uphill battle, but I dont even know the first step. It feels like the jobs I apply to just take my data and sell it.\nI want to try and not surrender to my despair again, but I noticed its rising voice as things have been plateauing for awhile. I want to keep fighting.\n I know my life is half over and I may never retire, but my biggest goal is to get away from the USA with my family at least before then.\n\nPlease help me find a path towards a better future. I dont want to lose the hope ive worked on for the last 2 years yet.\n\nI am willing to answer any questions and am a people pleaser.

After some time she would ask me how I'm doing, I have maybe few minutes until she starts giving advice, comparing my situation to some of her friends and going into detail again of her experience. Example: I would say that last few days I was sleeping poorly, she would instantly find any similar situation in her life and ramble about it for 20 or more mins, or undermine that it's not as bad as it is for her and go on again about her problems. It resulted in me avoiding contact and not opening up to her and she noticed that and blames me for not intiating meetings etc.\n\nWhat I tried: saying I don't need an advice, saying I don't like her comparing me, asking if we can change the topic, nothing works for more than 5 mins. I feel like either I have to be constantly guarding my boundaries of how much I want to listen or I have to disassociate and let her talk. \n\nWhat I want: have a more healthy relationship where I wouldn't be used for ventilation.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "Hi man, I get the struggle. We’ve all been there.\n\nHere are my two cents.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be an “official” meetup.\n\nMost people meet others through shared hobbies and places they repeatedly show up. If you think those people are cool (shared interests help, but sometimes you just don’t click), and they hopefully think you’re cool too, that’s when friendships happen.\n\nEverything comes down to a simple Venn diagram:\n\n* **Location** — where you regularly spend time\n* **Interests** — what you enjoy doing\n* **Click factor** — partly out of your control, partly on you to actually interact\n\nRelationships whether friendships or romantic ones typically happens in the overlap.\n\nThis is why it feels easier in high school or college: same places, similar age, overlapping interests. After graduation, that overlap shrinks. The default becomes work, or for some, a faith-based community like church. You show up often, see the same people, and the ones you click with become your friends.\n\nSometimes the problem is that your circles are too small.\n\n* If you spend most of your time watching movies (interest) at home (location), you’ll only meet and develop relationships with your housemates.\n* If you love music, basketball and photography you'll most likely not meet a lot of friends at a yoga retreet (assuming that's not another interest of yours as well).\n* And finally, you could be at the right location, and be around the right people but do not interact. That's the final piece of the puzzle.\n\nSo for best odds, expand your interests, expand the places you show up regularly at, and give yourself room to talk to people without self rejecting and labeling yourself as awkward or creepy.\n\nA simple opener:  \n“Hey, I just moved here from X and I’m looking for things to do around here. Any recommendations?”\n\nUse context. If someone’s holding a book you love, tell them it’s a great book. You don’t have to be the most interesting person in the room.\n\nEveryone is awkward. For most interactions, you’ll never see that person again so you don't need to feel pressure.\n\nOne practical tip that helps a lot: **ask one more question**.\n\nYou: “How long have you been coming here?”  \nThem: “About six months.”  \n(Conversation could end.)  \nYou: “Oh nice. What made you start?”\n\nThat’s it. \n\nHope that helps and best of luck out there!", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767637538.0, "id": "nxuzelb", "author": "quiet-momentum"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "I hope my experience can help someone", "text": "I've always been lonely. Not the kind of lonely where you don't have plans for the weekend. I'm talking about that quiet, heavy loneliness that follows you around everywhere in school, at home, in public. The kind that makes you feel invisible, even when people are all around you.\n\nI can't remember the last time I got a text just to talk. Not because someone needed something, just because they wanted to hear from me. My phone barely lights up anymore. And honestly, I've stopped expecting it to.\n\nI used to think something was wrong with me. that maybe I was too awkward, too boring, too quiet. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized I've always been this way. I was a kid who sat at the edge of the lunch table, who blended in with the noise, but never really belonged to it.\n\nI remember watching groups of friends laughing, sharing snacks, planning after school hangouts, and thinking, \"How do they make it look so easy?\" Because for me, every conversation felt like an audition. Every word I said was rehearsed. Every laugh felt forced. I wanted to be liked so badly that I forgot how to just be.\n\nAnd the truth is, I think people could sense that. They could tell I wasn't comfortable with myself. And when you don't love who you are, people pick up on it. So, they kept their distance. And I blamed myself.\n\nI'd go home and replay every moment. Why did I say that? Why did I sound so weird? Why can't I just act normal? That kind of thinking eats at you. It makes you feel smaller every single day.\n\nAnd slowly, you start pulling away. You stop trying. You stop talking until one day you realize you've built an entire life around your loneliness. You convince yourself you're fine, that you like being alone.\n\nYou scroll through social media, watch people post stories with their friends, and tell yourself you don't care, but you do. You care so much that it hurts. You start wondering if maybe people are just built differently, some made for connection, and others made to sit quietly in the background.\n\nBut then something strange happens. One day, you catch someone smiling at you in class, or you share a laugh at work. And for just a second, it feels like the world remembers you exist. That small moment, the tiny spark makes you realize how much you've been craving it because we all want to be seen.\n\nI remember being 15, sitting in my room at night, watching the light from my phone fade away after hours of silence. I told myself that no one cared, but deep down I just wanted one message, one person to ask, \"Are you okay?\"\n\nI used to hug my pillow and pretend it was someone who actually cared. It sounds sad when you say it out loud, but when you've gone years feeling unseen, you start to make up your own comfort.\n\nThat kind of loneliness changes you. It makes you overthink every friendship you've ever had. It makes you scared to reach out because you don't want to be a burden. It makes you wonder if you're even worth knowing.\n\nBut what I didn't realize back then is that connection isn't about being the funniest or the most interesting or the loudest. It's about being honest. People don't bond over perfection. They bond over pain, over shared silence, over the feeling of you.\n\nWhen I started opening up, really opening up, people began to respond differently. When I told someone I felt lonely instead of laughing, they said, \"Me, too.\" And that's when it clicked. I wasn't the only one feeling this way. Everyone's lonely. Some people are just better at hiding it.\n\nThe truth is, loneliness doesn't mean no one loves you, just means you haven't found the right people yet. The ones who understand that silence doesn't always mean you're mad, that you don't always have to talk to connected. The ones who stay when you disappear for a while, who notice your absence without blaming you for it.\n\nI started finding people like that when I was around 18 or 19. It wasn't overnight. It took small steps. Saying yes to an invite I'd normally decline, asking someone how their day was and actually listening to the answer.\n\nI had to force myself into discomfort. But slowly, I realized something. People weren't avoiding me. I was avoiding them. I was so scared of rejection that I rejected everyone first.\n\nAnd when I stopped doing that and when I started showing up as myself, awkward pauses and all, people started to stay. It made me understand something powerful. Being alone doesn't mean you're unlovable. It means you're preparing.\n\nBecause when you finally do meet real people, the ones who actually listen, the ones who see you, you'll value them more than anything. You'll know what it's like to miss connection. And that's what makes you treat it right when you finally have it.\n\nSometimes I still feel that loneliness. I think everyone does. But I don't fear it anymore because now I know it's not permanent. It's just a reminder that I that I care.\n\nThank you for reading.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767605902.0, "id": "1q4hewx", "author": "Ill-Parking-8099", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q4hewx/i_hope_my_experience_can_help_someone/"}

Was doing group therapy for a while but was spending more time supporting the others than figuring my own shit out. \n\n3) I'm very overweight and most of the time I'm comfortable with it and other times I'm reminded that the world genuinely hates fat people and so then I start to really hate myself too. I've done so many things to lose weight. Diet. Exercise. Surgery. Medicine. I lose it, it comes right back. Especially when  I'm severely depressed so you can guess what the last year has done for my body image and weight. I even walk regularly but the other night I took a really hard fall and I've cracked my rib so now I can hardly move. \n\n4) and now I'm lonely. So so lonely. I've been saying for a while I'm happy to be single and I genuinely was but the last few weeks I've felt a pang of loneliness unlike anything I've felt before and I feel convinced due to my weight and depression (and state of my home) I will never ever find love again (been single 10 years. I've dated and had hook ups but nothing since covid)\n\nThere is more but those are the main things. \n\nHow do I overcome this crushing weight I am feeling? I'm in antidepressants and have anti anxiety if I ever need it, but it all feels too much. I have a good doctor, a psych, and a therapist but most tell me things I already know (get moving, sleep better, eat better, etc). \n\nI just don't know if I can do any of it anymore.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "The thing to remember is that life really is just made up of small decisions which snowball into massive change, and that’s something to take huge encouragement from. \n\nBut I’m also a stark realist and always err on the side of action, which is precisely why I mentioned that book for you. \n\nLet’s break it down into plain truth: you’re in a rut because you’re not doing what you yourself already know you should be doing. And better than that, you yourself **want** change. All that’s holding you back is fear. We give it all kinds of complex names like “depression” and “anxiety” etc but this just boils down to tiny decisions…\n\nThe apartment looks like crap? Okay- today you can wash up all cups and bowls and stick some laundry on. Maybe later you can focus on a single room and get it spotless while listening to music. Doesn’t all have to be done in a day but anything you **do** achieve will make you feel so much better. \n\nFeeling like you’re wasting entire days? Okay so let’s write a small list of jobs that absolutely need doing and **do just one of them today**. Lists are categorically shown to have profound impact on goal attainment and nobody is really sure why, but it’s likely because they establish mental clarity. Even making the list is a “job” you can easily do! \n\nOvereating? Again, keep it simple- decide that the next portion of food you eat will be far smaller than usual. \n\nAnd on and on…a series of small goals. \n\nBe sure to always keep the internal dialogue on track too. “I just ate far less than normal, and that feels good” or “I just cleaned out all that junk in the bathroom…it may not be finished but I did something useful today”. Focus on small achievements. \n\nI promise you, before long it becomes a habit, and that habit gives you the confidence to aim for bigger goals. Eventually you’ll be sick of the excuses you’ve made in the past and reach a point where you think “Right, fuck this, I need to get out there and start socialising again- this isn’t the life I want”. \n\nEverything you want in life is very simple and easily achievable. And, fuck it, you might as well give it a shot because we all die anyway so there’s zero point sitting around waiting for it to happen…might as well decide “I’m done living like this; I’m gonna give it my best shot”. \n\nTrust me- that little book by Susan Jeffers has changed millions of lives because it’s pure gold. \n\nI know for a fact you can change your entire life and it’s time you started knowing it too. \n\nPeace and love. \n\nNow let’s change this shit! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1767591981.0, "id": "nxrrjnf", "author": "Dave-1066"}

I’d recommend listening to the book recommendations. Anything you’re facing in life 9/10 someone else also went through it and wrote a book about it &amp; how you can move forward. Also make very small goals for yourself everyday, it doesn’t have to be grand it just has to be some type of progress. Set a timer and clean for 5 minutes. Doesn’t matter what it is just 5 minutes of your time doing it. If you feel like doing more than so be it…. You never know one day you might set that timer to an hour and clean away. Also try to consume positive media during your cleaning, those old 2000s songs we all used to love. Maybe some house music will bring your mood up. I hope you feel better soon I understand how difficult it feels. I have an eating disorder and I starve myself during depression so I also understand loving and hating your body at the same time. The key is to find a diet thats sustainable. If you dont understand how our metabolism works I highly recommend doing a google search. If we keep yo yo’n our weight our metabolism will slow down to protect us…look into it because it might not be that your not moving enough or eating healthy enough your metabolism just might be trying to protect you.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "It definitely sounds like an uphill battle. I think the best advice I can offer is to find ways to keep your mind and body busy and comftorable while moving in a direction you feel you might be satisfied in.\n-For body activity I mean things like ways to stretch or get your blood flowing that you enjoy, rather than with a goal in mind like losing weight. If you can find a flow state(like through dancing or flow toys) it can help your feel better than exercise I found. Eventually you may find the stamina to do things you enjoy even when depression takes your energy.\n-For mental activity just learning about something that interests you can help your neuropathways and neuroplasticity remain open to change. If you can find a way to laugh you can also help your body produce more neurochemicals at the ready that feel more enjoyable.\n-For loneliness I dont have as much to contribute, but if you have a pet, or an animal you visit and offer food to, you can try to see the world through their eyes and make a connection with them. It can feel fufilling. For people specific clubs and virtual groups for special interests or games can help open ways to talk about the shared interest, then just talk about what you appreciate in it and find resonance in what they appreciate in it.\n\nAs hard as it may be dont underestimate the value of rest either, I know it may be tough to recognize when we hit lows of depression than stop us from doing most things, but I learned eventually there are many types and ways to rest.

I didn't. I got stuck into a similar pattern. My mental illness ruined the best friendship I ever could have dreamed of having.

Since then, I've had to move back with my parents, am in no way able to find work, and have lost the ability to socialize.

You don’t try to “fix your life.” You stop making it worse.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "Help me out of a rabbit hole", "text": "I had a period from grade 6-10 where I was unusually quiet, had little friends and self isolated from my friend group. I’m queer and bullied for it, then one day our classes shuffled where the group of students I had been with suddenly got dispersed into different sections. I thought this introversion was because of my queerness and feeling othered in a conservative society. From 11th grade and onwards (8 years) I was very outgoing, mentally healthy, never had depression or things of that sort.\n\nThen, after I graduated, I was having a hard time finding a job and this friend of mine recommended me to get on aderall. The thing is, I used to lose things a lot but I did really well academically and socially, and I used to just joke about having ADHD, although never diagnosed for it. The weird thing is, I went to the clinic, just told them I had trouble focusing (which now when I look back, I was probably being experiencing some self doubt due to not finding a swe job) and they just gave me vyvanse 40 mg which they upped to 60 mg. I started also taking an antidepressant (wellbrutin) and propanolol for anxiety. Now this is a pivotal moment because I didn’t have emotional dysfunction or dysregulation or whatever you call it before I started taking these meds.\n\nThen I also started smoking weed, which triggered mania and I experienced psychosis inpatient where I was admitted for a month and diagnosed with bipolar I.\n\nSince my diagnosis, I trusted the psychiatrist and took lithium, during my internship I experienced confusion on it where I couldn’t tell the direction and felt something really off about myself on the inside, it was like having dementia, I can’t explain what it felt like.\n\nSince tapering off, I have been so heavily critical of myself in front of my family, to the point where I started feeling the effects of that self deprecation. Perhaps because of my own stubbornness I just started letting myself go, in the sense of sleeping and not doing anything, even when before my parents would try their best to wake me up. I also started talking negatively about my friends to them and it was just complain, complain, complain, something very out of character for me. I then started obsessively reading reddit posts about people with bipolar and maybe to a large degree, internalized the fear and stigma of those comments and what it meant for my future. Now I realize I am spending over 15 hours a day on my phone, I stopped going out to events my friends would host and now it’s been crickets.\n\nThe thing is, my sister recently got married and we had my cousins stay over for two weeks. They very largely and consistently told me that they felt as though I had gone mute and spoke even less than this other four year old cousin, and that I seemed a lot dull. A family friend also mentioned that I had changed, as I used to be charming, wise and outgoing to now not even being able to hold a conversation or not contributing meaningfully to a discussion? The thing is, I have also recently started just taking deep breaths whenever I wake up and I sleep a lot because how else would I pass the day, I am currently not taking any meds (tbh this whole downwards spiral started from those in the first place. I was a competent, confident, bright person with so much humor and insights and promise). Now I feel like an empty husk of a person that can rarely go beyond small talk. The endless reading of reddit posts doesn’t help either.\n\nNow back to my friend, I despise her a whole lot, because she sold psychiatric drugs to me like an evangelist. Just kept hyping how good they are, how they’ll help me, etc etc. I have been blaming her consistently in my head. She recently sent me a text checking in, and I have yet to respond to her. One of the sucky parts about this is, there was this really handsome, sweet and charming guy from college, who hit me up a few months ago, but my head has been so cacophonic that I maybe didn’t put in as much effort in texting/calling him. Like we went out once and he made some effort to text/send me memes but I have never had a relationship since highschool and that too lasted a total of 3 months. So how do I even flirt when I am this spiraling ball of anxiety, mess and obsession. Basically, he hasn’t responded to my last text about him recommending any series to me. My cousin sister told me that I need to talk to someone everyday or so to connect, and it sucks that I really wanted to date this guy but I have just let my life go for the past 7 months that I don’t even know who I am anymore.\n\nIt really sucks because I graduated with two BS degrees in Physics and Electrical Engineering from an ivy. I was usually the person people turned to for advice and I was always commended for my confidence, charisma and social prowess. Yet lately, I have just been reading a bunch of reddit posts especially about psychiatry (mostly antipsychiatry) and I don’t know what the next steps in my life are.\n\nIdk if the “symptoms” I am experiencing, is the disorder in of itself or just a self fulfilling prophecy, because I started obsessing about it. Idk if lithium or any other drug will actually make me feel stable and like myself again, or if it will harm me, the way it did when I put my faith in it the first time around. It feels impossible to stop comparing myself to my past or to have these internal dialogue with myself but I know I need to snap out of it. I used to diet, exercise, socialize and all that before I started this medication mumbo jumbo, and now I hate that friend that was so adamant this stuff would help me, i hate those therapists who thought they knew better and those psychiatrists who were so careless with my life.\n\nLess than half a century ago, they used to lobotomize patients to cure depression, queerness itself was in the dsm. I wonder how the people in the future will react to how casually we take these meds and the absurd amount of harm it causes. I know my brain used to be so quiet and calm, before I started complaining and bickering and endless reading reddit and especially before the lithium incident, but it’s been such a long time that Ik i need to move on.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "This sucks, it’s not weak or weird for still feeling this way three months later. Rejection hurts, especially when you really thought the feelings were mutual and you still have to see her regularly. That kind of constant exposure makes it much harder to heal, so it makes sense that you’re stuck on it.\n\nOne thing that might help is reframing this experience. This probably won’t be the last time you feel this way, and that’s not a bad thing. Dating and relationships are often about testing the waters, learning what rejection feels like, and learning how to recover from it. As painful as it is, this is part of building emotional resilience for future relationships.\n\nIt would be a good idea to unfollow or mute her on social media, not as a punishment, but as a form of self-protection. You’re also allowed to set boundaries, even if she said she wants to stay friends. You don’t owe someone continued emotional access if it’s hurting you, and if she notices or asks about the distance, you don’t need to overexplain. Needing space is reason enough.\n\nBut most of all, pal, don’t ask her to prom unless you’re genuinely dating each other.

It’s a valid degree, yet I can’t stop feeling that all the time and effort I put into studying went to waste. I used to argue with my parents and cry at night. Over time, the stress started showing physically too—I noticed increased hair fall and even developed bald spots.\nEventually, I decided to try being happier—maybe by connecting with people and working on my abilities—because I knew my university alone wasn’t going to shape my future. I felt that if I left everything in the hands of my dad and the university, my future would be stuck.\nSo I made a Discord account. After about a month, I met someone really good (let’s call her X). Around that time, I started thinking more about projects and ideas, and the constant crying reduced. She’s experienced and has been actively developing her capabilities for about a year. She also has ADHD. I don’t know how, but I connected with her deeply.\nWe started building a learning project together. People on Discord often disappear, but she didn’t. She guided me, and we actually completed a project. We communicate well, and I’d say we’re friends.\nFor the first time, I felt like I had found a real way forward.\nLater, she started feeling low because of exams and family pressure, but she still kept talking to me. I related to her because I felt the same way when I got into my dream university but wasn’t allowed to go because of my dad.\nWe decided  to start a new startup project in December. The problem is that I don’t have strong technical proficiency yet. She has been working on her expertise for the past year, while I only started in November. I feel like I’m holding her back. At the same time, I think I’ve become emotionally attached. I’ve built an entire future in my head around how this startup could work.\nI don’t know what to do. I feel like my lack of experience might be slowing her down. .it is bcz startup idea instead of in production level is in learning level due to me. But if I walk away, I lose the one thing that helped me move past those difficult nights.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "How do I stop being insecure in my relationships/friendships?", "text": "\n(This is my first post, so sorry if I mess anything up)\n\nI’ve always been pretty insecure when it comes to my real life relationships and online friendships. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember, but I never really understood why until just recently. Lately, it feels like these insecurities have gotten worse. I’ve realized that because of my insecurity, I have a hard time trusting my own relationships, and it’s slowly affecting both me and the people I care about. (Even now im not entirely sure if insecurity is the root of the problem.) I overthink a lot, which obviously does not help.\n\nOne big issue i have is that I often feel scared that my friends will replace me. For example, one of my friends that I used to hang out with a lot has started spending time with someone else. I contsaly try telling myself that its not a big deal and that our friendship is strong because we've have known each other for years. Still, I cannot stop thinking that they have found someone better and dont need my anymore.\n\nI also feel selfish for wanting my friends to mostly just talk to me. This is not the first time this has happened either. In the past, I have subtly tried to belittle someone who had tried befriending my friends. I have grown out of that behavior and reflected on how harmful it was to me and to them, but the feelings behind it are still there.\n\nAnother thing I struggle with is getting overly attached to people (sometimes just one specific person) I end up basing my mood for the entire day based on how they treat me or whether they give me attention and is the reason why I overthink so much when friends dont pay attention to me even for just a second. I know this is unhealthy, and I am actively trying to work on it, but I am not sure how.\n\nSo basically my questions are:\n\n●  How do I stop being so insecure in my relationships? \n\n●  How do I stop getting overly attached to people in a way that hurts both me and them?\n\n● What are some ways I can work on myself and get rid of this mindset?\n\nAny advice would help and mean a lot.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "What you wrote sounds really painful, and also really honest. That fear of “they’ll find someone better and I’ll be left out” can take over so fast. And when it’s running, it makes total sense that you’d overthink, feel pulled to cling harder, and then feel guilty about it afterwards.\n\nOne helpful way to frame it is that a lot of the suffering comes from fear of being forgotten, abandoned, or replaced. When that fear is strong, it can create wrong perceptions and a lot of worry, and then jealousy and desperation can show up too. The hard part is that once those feelings are there, if we keep “feeding” them with more thinking, they get more power and can push us into saying or doing things we don’t actually want to do (even subtle stuff, like trying to put someone else down). It’s also normal that you can see the behavior was harmful but the feelings behind it are still alive.\n\nAnother point that might take some pressure off is that letting go of attachment is usually not something you can force all at once. It’s more like learning from your attachment and releasing it gradually, starting with what you can actually notice in yourself.\n\nA very simple thing to try in the exact moment the insecurity spikes is to drop the argument with your thoughts and return to one small breathing pattern. You can use a short “breathing poem” like this: in, out. Deep, slow. Calm, ease. Smile, release. While breathing in and out with those words, you are training your mind to stop running and come back to what’s real right now. When you get to “smile, release,” it’s specifically practicing letting go of the worries about the future and the regrets about the past, so you are not a victim of them for that moment. If jealousy is there, you can include a gentle recognition like: I’m aware jealousy is here, I will take care of it. Not to judge it, but to stop it from driving the next message you send or the next thing you do.\n\nThere is a guided version of that practice on youtube. It’s a short contemplation on “in, out. deep, slow. calm, ease. smile, release.” The video is called \"Cultivating Calm and Ease: Immersive Contemplation Guided by Thich Nhat Hanh\", in case you want to try it.\n\nThis practice comes from the Plum Village tradition.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "Let me teach you something that will be one of the most important things you'll ever learn. It's called The Compound Effect. This means that there's power in small but consistent effort that can't be relocated by big but inconsistent effort. \n\nYou're young, you want everything right now. This causes you to make a mistake; you discourage yourself. \n\nBut let's do a little math here. Let's say that you walked 5 minutes in the morning, and 5 before bed for a year. Only 5. That's 10 minutes per day, 365 days. Now that \"only 5\" has become 3,650 minutes. That's 60.8 hours. \n\nBut what if you walked one minute more at each walk, every week. 5 becomes 6. 6 becomes 7. 7 becomes 8. There are 52 weeks in a year. So that's 5 weeks to get to 20 minutes every day. \n\nIf you stopped there, you'd be doing 7,300 minutes or 121 hours of waking per year. \n\nLet's say that after 3 months of increasing only 1 minute per walk, per week, you added 5 pushups. 1 more pushup per session per week. When you reach 10 pushups, alternate it with body weight squats every other day. \n\nThis is doable. Your body, your mind, and your life has time to adjust. Without misery, without discouraging yourself. It becomes a habit after a month. Suddenly you're no longer fighting yourself; it has become automated. \n\nNext, once that habit is installed, next you add in a healthy bit of veggies before eating your usual food. You replace chips with carrots and dip. One change at a time. Not huge instant changes. \n\nAfter a while of doing this, you'll realize that you've lost weight, and more importantly, you've done it without all the feeling of suffering. \n\nMaking incremental changes that you allow to become habits will create enduring change. Instead of a series of failures to work out for 30 minutes with a heavy, out of shape, exhausted, and miserable body... You will have created a lifestyle of health in the way our minds are best equipped to do it. \n\nWhen you miss a session, or a week, or even a month... Just get back to it. You'll work your way back up faster each time. \n\nThis idea that you can go from fully sedentary to Arnold Schwarzenegger type workouts in a day is bonkers. We don't function under those conditions. \n\nYou will best make real and lasting changes by doing it in a methodical way over time. Create one new good habit at a time. Master one and then move on while maintaining the first. \n\nOne day, not long from now, you won't recognize yourself. \n\nOr keep doing what you're doing and traumatizing yourself, whatever floats your boat. 😏", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767499117.0, "id": "nxkeydo", "author": "Sandi_T"}

Slow down, create the habit first. \n\nWe all want a magic bullet or a quick pill. Accept that it will take time, and remind yourself that you're gaining something even more important... Self discipline and delayed gratification. \n\nThis desire for instant gratification turns us into rats in a maze.

The reason I'm thinking of ending my life is a cliche: life is absolutely meaningless and purposeless, full of suffering for no reason. I also think everyone, including myself is stupid, which makes sense because we are imperfect, mortal, and have limited minds. However, I guess I literally can't accept or deal with the fact we are all this imperfect and stupid, biding time to all of our inevitable deaths into nothingness. I genuinely hate this thought.

People  commit the worst \"atrocities\" and \"crimes\" every single day, and I could do the exact same thing. What makes people do those things? How can you even blame them? Nothing matters. How could you be upset at someone?

And that's the entire reason I'm on reddit, where I can assume I will get absolutely nothing from, but at least its something.

Everytime I see a good looking guy, I just get fucking mad and angry and I wanna kick his ass so fucking badly. I feel terrible for feeling like this when I dont even fucking know the guy. I keep seeing reels about how these good looking guys basically do borderline SA and all the girls in the comments are talking about how hot it was or how beautiful it is, or how turned on they are, but if it was an average guy, or someone that looked like me, that mf would have been in jail. Like this whole fucking society is based on appearance and so many people get handed things because of their appearance. Everyone is so fucking shallow and materialistic and only after aesthetics and im so tired of it. Anytime I go outside to train or go grab food, and I see these stupid happy PDA couples who are so beautiful and have pretty eyes and smiles - i just have to urge to go up to them, challenge both people to a 2v1 fist fight - straight boxing, and ill fuck them both up badly, ill rearrange their fucking faces so theyll both turn ugly and theyll know how I feel, I wanna fucking hurt them so badly, but i cant. I sometimes wonder if said relationship would fall apart if one party got into a freak accident and altered his appearance, 9/10 it wont last.

Sounds dumb, but has worked for me with anxiety and other negative feelings that were unjustified. Something about the talking about it to myself gave the desire to stop thinking that way a little more power, and thinking about it objectively when I had the time helped get used to the feeling and get more ammunition for telling my brain to lay off and that it was bullshit.\n\nHope that helps a little, and congrats on getting it out and all the good things.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "I hear how tired you are—and I want to be careful here, because this isn’t a personal failure on your part.\n\nA hard truth I learned late is this: most people aren’t withholding interest; they simply never learned how to enter a reciprocal space. They’re trained to receive stimulation, not to co-create presence. So when you offer depth, curiosity, warmth—you become the signal, and they become the audience without realizing it.\n\nThat doesn’t mean they don’t care about you as a person. It means many people don’t know how to relate without leaning on the other to carry the energy.\n\nThe turning of the table usually doesn’t come from explaining yourself better or giving more. It comes from doing the opposite, gently:\n\nSay a little less.\nAsk one honest question, then stop.\nNotice who picks it up—and who lets it drop.\n\nReciprocity reveals itself very quickly when you stop performing it.\n\nYou’re right about screens amplifying this. They reward response, not presence. But the deeper issue isn’t technology—it’s that mutual attention is a skill, and most people were never taught it.\n\nThe frustrating part is this: people like you often attract many, but are only met by a few. And that mismatch is exhausting.\n\nSo the goal isn’t to get everyone to participate. It’s to recognize the rare ones who already know how—and conserve yourself for them.\n\nIf it helps to hear this plainly: wanting back-and-forth doesn’t make you needy.

From my perspective, it feels like I never woke up at all.\n\nWhat’s even stranger is that when someone tries to wake me up, I can respond, talk, and even hold a short conversation, but later I remember absolutely nothing. People tell me I sounded awake, yet my mind was clearly not conscious. It’s like my body is functioning on autopilot while my awareness is completely offline.\n\nI usually only wake up naturally after 10-14 hours of sleep, which feels extreme. What’s worse is that when I sleep that long, I don’t feel rested, I feel heavy, groggy, mentally foggy, and sometimes even worse than if I had slept less. If I try to wake up earlier, the only thing that works is physical force, such as someone pulling me out of bed. Even then, I barely register what’s happening. Loud noises, bright lights, or even water don’t reliably wake me up.\n\nAt the same time, here’s the part that really confuses me: when I sleep only 4-6 hours, I often function surprisingly well. I can think clearly, work, study, and feel relatively normal during the day. This happens regardless of when I sleep, at night, during the day, or in the evening. The issue seems completely independent of my sleep schedule, location, or environment. No matter where I am or how I sleep, the same pattern repeats.\n\nI actively try to improve my sleep quality. I always keep fresh air in my room, avoid extreme temperatures, and make an effort to create the best possible sleep conditions. Despite that, I frequently sleepwalk, talk in my sleep almost every night, and sometimes even walk around without remembering it the next day.\n\nThis all started about 2-3 years ago and has been getting progressively worse. Before that, I could wake up instantly to any alarm, no matter how little I slept. I was the type of person who could get up sharply and function right away. Now, it feels like the complete opposite waking up has become the hardest part of my day.\n\nFor context, I’m a civil engineering student and I also work around 30-40 hours a week in an online casino. My schedule can be demanding, but this sleep issue exists regardless of workload or stress levels. Even during calmer periods, the problem remains.\n\nI’m not trying to self-diagnose or jump to conclusions. I’m simply trying to understand whether others have experienced something like this extreme difficulty waking up, functioning better on short sleep than long sleep, and having no memory of alarms or conversations.\n\nIf you’ve dealt with anything similar, what helped you understand what was going on? What steps did you take, and did anything actually improve the situation over time?", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767400495.0, "id": "1q2fs2i", "author": "Evening_Row942", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q2fs2i/i_m_19_cant_wake_up_from_alarms_i_function/"}

(i apologize for the yap, it's just that i have so much to get off my mind. i'm also typing this at 4 am so there will probably be a lot of grammar mistakes, hopefully what i'm communicating is still clear). if anyone has experienced anything similar to what i am experiencing right now, i would really appreciate it if you could take the time to share your experiences and how you overcame it. but really, anyone is welcome to share their own perspectives and advice, even if you haven't been in this situation before", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767375121.0, "id": "1q24ucc", "author": "LongjumpingLead7889", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q24ucc/overcoming_procrastination_and_doomscrolling/"}

She forced him to go to cram schools, made him sleep next to her until he's 16, treating him like a baby and limiting certain options in his life, as extreme as deciding what he eats and spoon fed him until 12.

When he's interacting with his friends, he's a cheerful person, knowing how to use polite Japanese and read people's emotions but at home he's just isolating himself from everyone and it's making my mother mad.

Even brushing my teeth soon after waking up would be super difficult because I’d just gag the entire time. It got so bad that thinking about gagging/vomiting made me gag/vomit.

They even put me under some anaesthesia to put a camera in my stomach to look around for something and nothing was found. Though, the doctor left me with one question that I reacted to in completely different ways when I was 17, and then again when I was around 23. “Are you sure you aren’t anxious about something?” I guess I was in denial back in high school but I’ve realized that this is probably the root cause. \n\nToday it’s still the same.

A few steps I've taken are identifying anything that gives me acid reflux, as well as not laying down after eating, not eating too late, etc. The basic stuff for settling your stomach - even though the vomiting was from my anxiety, eliminating any other triggers helped.\n\nUltimately, it's been weekly CBT/DBT therapy, eliminating stress, behavior changes, and coping mechanisms like breathing exercises and exercise. The weekly therapy has helped me change my narrative that led to my anxiety. I put boundaries in place with work, my family, and myself that lowered my stress. I prioritized real rest. \nOne thing that I identified is not looking at my phone first thing in the morning. My alarm goes off and I go and make my coffee, have a protein bar (I also can barely stomach anything in the morning), get dressed, and THEN look at my phone. It's a never ending stream of stressors that trigger my nerves.\n\nDo I still have anxiety vomit? Sometimes - before a job interview was the last one. But I know now where they come from and I have the skills to ride it out and recover.\n\nThis plagued me for over 5 years. I wish there was a pill or a cream or a magical quick fix, but it ultimately took time and hard work.

I constantly feel like I'm behind and just a fucking idiot. This winter break while I did apply to more internship and did some technical practice problems I didn't build anything new. I've been trying the past week to do something with the homelab I set up but it all feels so worthless and it just overwhelms me to where its much harder to get work done than usual.\n\nBefore college there was at least some sense of path and direction but once I entered my 20s its like it all faded away.\n\nOne of my biggest goals in 2026 is to be more productive, but I don't know how. I don't know how I can sit and work on something when I don't know where even to go. I want to just learn and absorb as much as I can and figure what interests me the most but at the same time I have to lock down something in what feels like such a short period of time. Passion projects just turns into \"impress the recruiters\", and all learning feels pointless because even then it feels like I can't win against the ATS system.\n\nSo how can I make 2026 my year, because I feel my spirit breaking. I want to priotize my mental and physical health, start meditating and exercising and build new habits like being organized, but it feels like anything is a waste of time if I'm not like those people on Instagram grinding their life away and being ultra productive. I don't know how to break out of this mentality. My biggest regret in high school was worrying so much about the same thing and not building things that interested me, but now in college the doomerism has been eating away any passion I once had. I know people say that one of the most important things is to have a clear goal and believe in yourself but I feel like a failure and have no sense of direction", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767330220.0, "id": "1q1pr4o", "author": "BBQ_BolognaPB", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q1pr4o/how_do_you_be_productive_when_totally_lost_and/"}

I should add that it is all clearly lighthearted fun, so I don't blame him for being frustrated.

At some point I just lose the internal energy to continue habits that recently felt manageable.\nThe longest I can last is about 1–1.5 months. After that I crash for days, sometimes a week or even longer. Then I realize I need to change something again, restart self-improvement, and the cycle repeats.\nI’m exhausted and frustrated. I feel like I’m incapable of being consistently disciplined, and it makes me fear that I’ll never be able to improve my life in a deeper, long-term way.\nMy questions:\nHow do you prevent these crashes instead of constantly restarting?\nHow do you maintain discipline long-term without falling into complete burnout or self-destruction?\nWhat could be causing this repeated cycle if motivation and awareness are already there?", "score": 3, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1767306175.0, "id": "1q1gzdg", "author": "Reasonable-Effect442", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q1gzdg/i_keep_failing_at_selfdiscipline_after_115_months/"}

I feel bad about not eating what I'm given by parents. Parents help me with what I've just said, and both my head of year and mum agreed that counseling would help. \n\nWhat should I do?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "Cooked at young age, is it possible to redeem?", "text": "I am a 14-year-old math semi-genius. I have too many problems, but my biggest and most powerful one is my corn addiction. It started when I was 10 and very curious about everything because things bored me quickly. Like any young child, I soon stumbled onto it. At first, I thought it was weird, but then once I tried it, I got hooked on it. Pleasure, Relief, and so many more emotions went through me at the epitome of my sessions that I couldn't stop. It was sort of a coping mechanism for things going on around me. Whenever I was stressed, I would squeeze one out after school and then get back to my homework. For the first year, it wasn't a problem, once a month or so. It wasn't harming me at all. However, as school got tougher in 6th grade, family issues came onto me, and I would start to retreat to this terrible habit. Around that time is also when a couple of my friends got on it, ofc no one would say it, but from the jokes and stuff going on, I could tell easily that everyone was hooked. So some of the guilt was taken off, but it was still hurting me. Whenever I was overwhelmed, I would paralyze till I could do it. Sometimes I would sit in the classroom for hours, running on 5% brain power (somehow still enough to keep up with everyone) until I finally got home to do it.  - side info, I was and still am great at math, in 5th grade I was able to do trigonometry with ease, now it's around multivariable calc (but I skipped stats cuz it was annoying) - I feel like I really missed out on alot of things I could have done if I hadn't wasted my time waiting for pleasure and lust looking at women. In 7th grade, I fell for women and committed to them. (so no fap or corn) I had a good time talking and stuff, but I was and still am too young for that stuff, so it had to end with a stupid trust issue and her snitching on me being in a situationship. (since I'm not supposed to due to family reasons) After that, I fell deep into depression and addiction (multiple a day). It was a tough time for sure, but somehow I made it through to the point I actually started self-help on my own. That's when I picked up math again (6th and 7th grade, I didn't do much outside of the classroom because of the things I just said) and started on algebra 2. Around here, I stopped for like 2 months. But my self-help stopped in October because my new GF, who was there through most of it, but never knew anything, had to break up cuz her dad found out about our relationship, and I had to willingly agree because he threatened to get me jailed and ruin my future if I kept talking. So yeah, another depression phase. I picked up the bad habit again because it had been there for most of my teen years and just became impossible to stop. It felt like trying to walk through an avalanche. Even after 2 months, I haven't made much progress on this problem. Tbh I feel like that corn has helped grow some of my problems, such as depression, because post-nut clarity cooks everyone. Oh yeah, all this time I have acted innocent and unaware of corn. So yeah, idk what to do now, and kinda hopeless. My life looks grim, even with all my potential. Is there anything I can do in particular, because everything I tried last time failed me? If there's nothing, and I get rejected from my dream high schools, I might just off myself to end this misery.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nIts about a week ago, I have started regulating my addiction a bit, but its still not looking good.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1767280908.0, "id": "1q16l2c", "author": "Open-Excuse7123", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q16l2c/cooked_at_young_age_is_it_possible_to_redeem/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "title": "A Fixed Mindset and a Carnivorous Envy at 16.", "text": "Hi everyone. I’m a 16-year-old artist and writer with diagnosed Autism and ADHD. I’m currently at a crossroads where my dream of making a Shonen-inspired manga with themes heavily inspired by my real life but I'm being suffocated by a mindset that feels like it’s corroding my sense of self. \n\nWhat helps me is giving this envy I struggle with a \"character\". My envy isn't malicious, and I don't take it out on others (it's mainly misdirected grief), but I’ve realized that beneath every good intention I have, there is this carnivorous, scared, and envious \"dog\" barking inside me. \n\nEvery time I see an artist I admire talk about their fanbase or the impact they’ve made, this dog starts barking louder. It’s not just \"I want that skill\"; it’s this existential panic that keeps telling me, \"Because you aren't there yet, you are nothing. You are a joke. You are a disappointment.\" I feel threatened by these creators that have changed my life and moved my heart because of a\"One-Seat Fallacy\" where I feel if they have already saved people with their art, there is no room left for my story. As a result, they become a mirror of my \"unrealised potential\". I stop hearing their art (music in this case) and start hearing the future version of me that I'm afraid I won't become. I see them as a person who's already \"stolen\" the words from my mouth, rather than someone who proved those words are worth saying.\n\nBECAUSE of that, I’m trapped in a Fixed Mindset loop:\n\n* I see a creator I love being thanked for their impact.\n* I desperately want to \"mean something\" to people like they do.\n* I realize how many years of work I have ahead of me and feel like I'm already \"too late.\"\n* I beat myself up so hard that I stop creating entirely to avoid the \"proof\" that I won't have a legacy through my art. Not necessarily about it being \"good\".\n\nI like to cope about these feelings through writing dialogue between myself and a mentor figure. The side of me that knows what I need to hear but can't believe it without them being told. \n\nThe logical side of me knows the truth: \"If you want to make a story that saves someone's life, let it save yours first.\" I know that excellence is a habit, not a product. I know that even a single line changes the synapses in my brain and proves I’m capable. \n\nBut there is a huge gap between knowing the path and walking it. Emotionally, I’m terrified of the amount of time I'll have to keep trying before I can make something even mediocre. I’m terrified that every second I'm not walking that path, I’m falling. So I stand still and start thinking to myself, \"I don't know if I have 2-5 years to spend improving... every time I think about it, I just think of how behind I am.\". I genuinely want to put in the hard work and I keep returning to my art despite my feelings because I care about making myself proud.\n\nI'm in a constant state of mourning for a version of myself that could just exist as the kid who did things for the simple fun of it, not because it proved anything. The version of me who didn't set himself up to fill unimaginable shoes. I am so desperate to matter in the future that I am refusing to let myself matter in the present. I’m looking for advice on a few specific things:\n\n* How do you tame the \"Dog\"? How do you deal with that aggressive, barking envy without letting it turn into self-punishment or the urge to \"break the mirror\"?\n* How do you move from \"Meaning something to the world\" to \"Meaning something to yourself\"? I struggle to find value in my art if it doesn’t have a massive audience attached to it yet and I keep forgetting the advice that, \"your best audience are the people you are most comfrotable with.\"\n* How do you practice when your self-worth is tied to the result? How do I pick up the pencil for \"fun\" again when my brain tells me that if it isn't a masterpiece, it was a waste of time? I want to turn this pain into something that moves my heart, but the pressure to be \"someone\" is heavy. \n\nAny perspective on breaking out of this fixed mindset would mean the world.

I feel I am at my peak, flourishing. My mindset—I am doing so great. I have accomplished many of my weaknesses from my teenage years. The way I see myself, I see a beautiful young girl: good hair, good skin, a beautiful body weight. I wore braces in my 25th year; I am so confident in my smile. But one thing that I was never able to feel was being loved correctly by a man and being in a relationship that is leading to marriage, because after some time or months, the relationship would break.\n\nSo what is love? I feel love definitely starts with a strong attraction, and then you continue the courtship based on that happy feeling. Then gradually, you realise you brought another person into your life—a stranger who lived their whole life and was brought up by other parents who have different education, background, culture, and behaviour.\n\nI get so focused and so involved in their lives that I forget mine. I forget my goals, which is wrong, I know, but it happens so naturally; only when it ends do I realise this, which leads to regret and deep guilt because I was so focused on their every move.\n\nI focus on whether I am their priority, whether they love me, their thoughts, their thinking, the gut feeling that changes every day. I feel so drained and lack energy and feel so weak. Sometimes my gut feeling becomes true; I change the way I feel and they distance themselves—my biggest fear.\n\nI do not feel I would find love, nor do I want any advice. Just tell me what you think love is.\n\nIt is 2026. I just want to say that I feel enough. I am enough. I am worthy. I am beautiful. I am happy. I want to achieve each of my goals. I want to be at peace, be genuinely happy, have a regulated nervous system, achieve all of my goals, overcome the fear of being loved and left by someone, and have a committed and beautiful relationship that leads to marriage.\n\nAlso, I realise the man I would love has his thoughts and life too. I want to grow with him, work towards creating a multimillion empire, and build something together.\n\nJust imagine getting married to someone where he is just working, not planning dates, not spending quality time with you, not taking care of you, stopping putting in effort—it will finish me gradually. I want us to be happy, pursue each other, make each other feel important, seen, and heard, and accomplish things where we are both super obsessed with each other.\n\nI am scared of the love I have today, because I am facing all of it.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767253107.0, "id": "1q0yp8r", "author": "Impressive-Worth-633", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhelp/comments/1q0yp8r/what_truly_is_love/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "Here's the all thing.... ​I felt really hurt by what happened recently. My male friend went out for lunch with his other group, and even though that girl was with them,(she's also part of that group) he didn't invite me. What’s worse is that the girl also didn't message me to tell me they were going or invite me either. It really stung because whenever I plan our group gatherings, I always make sure to invite her specifically, even though she isn't even part of our group. I only do that because she’s his friend and I want to be nice, but she couldn't do the same for me.\n​What’s so confusing is how she acts. She’s always so sweet to my face and tells me I’m her priority, but my gut has been telling me something is off. She hadn’t messaged me in days, but as soon as they got back from lunch, she suddenly started texting me like nothing happened, asking how my day was. It felt so fake because she only reached out once the plans were over.\n​When I asked my friend why he didn't invite me on his own, he tried to use my current situation as an excuse, saying he was just keeping my circumstances in mind. But I know that was just a cover-up and the truth is he simply forgot about me. When I asked him, \"If my situation were different, would you have actually invited me yourself?\" he got really defensive. He told me that I had already made up my mind to make him the bad guy and that I was just letting my insecurities win. He keeps insisting that nothing has changed between us, but his words feel so manipulative.\n​It’s frustrating because he tells me to share how I feel, but when I actually do, he refuses to acknowledge my feelings. He just gives me these \"logical\" replies to shut me down and makes me feel like I’m the one being \"extra\" or overthinking it. I realized I had high expectations because I expected them to treat me the way I treat them, and now I’m just left feeling confused and unheard.\nand then i saw their snap together and all i just feel that the girl is mocking me intentionally and I'm really tired of this thingg.. 😭", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767250303.0, "id": "nx1nmrm", "author": "an_overthiinker"}

You’re just choosing yourself instead of staying stuck in a loop that keeps hurting you.\n\nAnd please, believe me, time will change everything.

Even when people are talking to me, I’m listening, but it’s like I don’t fully process what they’re saying.\n\nWhat’s confusing me is that I don’t feel motivated to work or do anything productive *but* I do have the energy to doomscroll on Reddit or Instagram, or spend a lot of time searching for trips, restaurants, or random things online. I can stay engaged in those activities easily, but the moment it’s something work-related or mentally effortful, my brain just shuts down.\n\nI also feel like my attention span has shrunk a lot, and my memory feels weaker than before, I forget things more easily or struggle to recall information I just read. My critical thinking feels off, and tasks that used to feel easy now take much more effort. Sometimes it genuinely feels like I’m mentally slower than I used to be, which is worrying.\n\nThis is worrying me because I *want* to work and concentrate, but my brain just doesn’t cooperate.\n\nHas anyone gone through something like this?  \nWhat helped you improve focus, mental clarity, and critical thinking again?\n\nAny advice or personal experiences would really help.

I went through a lot of personal issues, lies, and broken trust. Mentally it affected me a lot. Even today, I know I didn’t make mistakes, but handling everything and moving on took months.

I relaxed, laughed, and felt normal after a long time. After that, I slowly started focusing better, learning new things and exploring AI more seriously.\n\nThen October came. While everyone was celebrating Diwali, I lost my father. That moment changed everything. It was a huge downfall for me. Along with grief, I was left with regrets and thoughts that still hurt deeply.\n\nBy the end of 2025, it honestly felt like everything I trusted had gone wrong. People, faith, emotions, life itself. This has been one of the toughest years of my life mentally and emotionally.\n\nNow I’m trying to get back to a normal life. Some days are okay, some days are heavy. But I’m moving forward slowly.\n\nFor 2026, my plan is simple. I want to rebuild myself and focus on growth. I’m planning to post regularly, maybe every month, about my AI engineering journey.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "selfhelp", "text": "Hey friend, thank you for being honest about something that’s uncomfortable. That alone already shows growth.\nA few things that might help you see this differently:\n\n1️⃣ Kids do act out when they feel threatened or confused.\nWhen you were 11–12, your brain was still learning how to handle conflict and emotions. Most people have memories from that age where they acted in ways they regret now. That doesn’t make you a bad person — it makes you human.\n\n2️⃣ Guilt is actually a sign you’ve changed.\nPeople who don’t care never feel guilty.\nThe fact that this bothers you means you’ve already moved a long way from who you were back then.\n\n3️⃣ You don’t have to force apologies if it’s not possible or safe.\n\nSometimes the best apology is how you treat people now and in the future. You can still make things right by:\nNot repeating the same behaviours.\nBeing kind to others now.\nSpeaking up for people who get treated the way you once treated others.\nYour growth becomes the apology.\n\n4️⃣ Compassion for your younger self matters too.\nYou made decisions with the understanding you had at the time — often while feeling hurt first. You weren’t trying to be a villain. You were trying to defend yourself in the only way you knew how.\nIf you still feel like you need closure, you can try something like:\n“Hey, I’ve been thinking about how I acted when we were younger. I’m sorry if I ever made you feel bad — I was struggling with my own stuff. I’m trying to be better now.”\n\nSimple. Honest.

When I say “if it’s safe or possible,” I’m mostly talking about your wellbeing:\n\nSafe can mean:\nThe person won’t mock you or try to hurt you emotionally.\nThey won’t twist your apology into something against you.\nYou feel steady enough to handle whatever response you get.\n\nPossible means:\nYou’re still in contact in some way.\nYou actually want to open that door again.\nIt wouldn’t make things worse for either of you.\n\nSometimes the people we hurt when we were young were also people who hurt us — or people who still aren’t kind. In those cases, you don’t owe them access to you.\nAnd the beautiful thing is: You can still make amends through the way you live now.\nHow you treat others today is part of the apology.\nYour growth itself is a form of healing.\n\nSo don’t feel pressured to go back to anyone who makes you feel small or unsafe. Kindness doesn’t require putting yourself in harm’s way.\n\nYou’re already doing the important part: caring enough to ask these questions, and wanting to be better than yesterday.
