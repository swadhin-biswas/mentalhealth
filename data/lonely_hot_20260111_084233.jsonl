In my free time, I enjoy video games ( From story play to rogulike ) , and having genuine, deep conversations. I’m generally curious about people and their perspectives.\n\n\n\nWhat you’re looking for:\n\nPrimarily friendship and regular conversation. I'd love to find friends to chat with about our interests, daily life, or anything interesting that comes to mind. I’m also very keen on improving my Polish language skills (I’m currently at a beginner/elementary level), so I’d be happy to connect with native speakers or learners for practice.\n\n\n\nAny other little details:\n\nI’m currently located in Poland. I’m a fan of clever and loyal dogs (and animals in general!). My music taste leans heavily toward movie/game soundtracks and synthwave.

I just really need to vent because I think this is the loneliest I’ve ever felt, which is strange since I love to be alone.\n\nI just started at a new university and everyone somehow bonded during the first week and made friends. I am friendly with everyone, pretty I guess, very conciderate and good at school. But I am an introvert and stiff and awkward which is my curse and flaw. I yet again feel so excluded from my peers, I never get invited anywhere and never am I in the group. I don’t understand wtf is so wrong with me? When will I find my people?\n\nIn middle school I felt this way. Then high school. And in each stage of my life I just tought- things will be different at the next step, there I will find my people and belong. And now I’m at university, feeling ”uncool” and the same loneliness I felt when I was younger. A constant loop of never truly belonging anywhere and never being someones first pick.\n\nThat leads me to my next heartache and I think the core reason for my loneliness- inexperience with love. I have never dated. Never been on a relationship. Never had a talking stage or a situationship. This gnaws me and makes me feel so unwanted, flawed and.. doomed lol. Like I am so lonely, that I have lost all faith that someone will ever love me romatically. How sad to be a hopeless romantic without hope. People around me say ”go on dating apps, meet new people!” But honestly who would even want to be with me? Me? Out of all the beautiful, relaxed and fun people. \n\nI have sort of made peace with my loneliness. If I have managed to live this way for 21 years, I guess I can go on this way for 21 more. And I don’t want to sound pretentious of fake deep, but idk I have such deep inner life and ”niche interests”, that it feels better to just be alone. Where no one can reject me and I can be at peace.

I even thought, this feels too good to be true. But I ignored it because it was comforting.

Random observations.\nShe replied to my stories.\nShe stalked my followers and sent me other girls’ IDs, asking who they were.\nShe jokingly asked if I was in a relationship, with knife emojis.\nShe said things like, “agar relationship me hote toh batati.”\nIt felt like someone was paying attention to me.\nI’m an artist, and I process emotions by creating. At some point, I started drawing her. Not because she asked — just because that’s how my mind works. I spent hours on it. Shading. Coloring. Quietly caring.\n\nWhen it was almost done, I sent a surprise — a sneak peek of the drawing.\nI got a voice note back.\nA girl’s voice, reacting with excitement, saying something like “woooow, how pretty.”\nI remember feeling this wave of relief.\nLike, okay… she’s real. I wasn’t imagining things.\nA little later, another voice note came.\nThis time it was a man’s voice.\nHe calmly said what was going on — that the account wasn’t real, that he had been catfishing, and that the girl’s voice was his sister reacting to the drawing.\nThat was it.\nNo drama. No long explanation.\nI didn’t argue.\nI didn’t insult him.\nI didn’t ask why.\nI just replied with one line: “Khush reh.”\nSoon after, the account was deleted.\n\nAnd now there’s just… nothing.\nNo chats.\nNo pings.\nNo explanation to process later.\nI know the person wasn’t real — but the routine was.\nThe anticipation was.\nThe feeling of being noticed, even casually, was.\nWhat hurts isn’t the catfishing itself.\nIt’s that when it ended, I realized I don’t actually have anyone.\nNo one I could text about this.\nNo one to sit with me while the silence set in.\nI’m usually the listener, the calm one, the guy who’s “fine.”\nBut when I finally wasn’t fine, there was no one there.\nI don’t feel dramatic sadness.\nI feel numb.

I don't have the answer to that question yet but I'm working on figuring that out. Obviously I don't know your whole situation and if university is the right option for you right now then go for it but all I'd say is there's other options out there too. You're only 19 and have your whole life to pursue a career. Think outside the box like what if you went and became a forest firefighter in British Columbia for a year, or a ski instructor in Japan, or an English teacher in Thailand. Again I know these cost money, parents hold you back, etc so I I know it's a lot easier said then done but just remember there's so many more options out there than we are told to consider.

But since my father was from a Vipassana (method by Gautama the Buddha) background, Headspace naturally suited me. After the paid plan expired, I wasn’t too interested in renewing it because what I was looking for was not just meditation and mental skill but a community as well, to share my love and joy which I had so much in me that everyone around me seemed to be too busy or in their own heads to ever listen. This made me stop using the headspace app. \n\nThen I went for depression, and laziness, marijuana abuse and the whole spiral. \n\nThen I started listening to SadhguruJV on youtube and things started making sense. I stopped doubting my intuitions or seek validation for my thinking methods. Slowly after I was mentally capable enough, I took up the Inner Engineering course. It was a unique experience. I undeniably had an out of body experience (with no drugs 😄). \n\nRight now, I too use the Miracle of Mind app by him and it’s been totally lit for me since then dude.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "lonely", "title": "Feeling depressed about my life, depressed i didnt move to NYC sooner", "text": "Long post. 28F. As Ive mentioned in previous posts, ive always wanted to live in the US, specifically New York City. I have US citizenship, but Ive never lived in the country and had hardly visited until last year. I would have loved to study in the US but I was afraid of college debt. Also, my mother (she is from NYC, hated growing up there, left at 17, never went back) was always extremely negative and discouraging of my desire to move there, and made it very clear growing up that she hated life in America and that we (her children) were not American, that we were only American on paper. But I had always been very curious to go and travel there and live there, and had a deep desire to connect with that side of me, because on some level I did feel American. In the end, at 18, I left spain where im originally from and I went to study in Switzerland where I was never fully happy, even very unhappy at times, but I stayed because of the financial safety. I told myself that I would eventually leave, when I had enough savings. I wish that I had left after my bachelors degree in 2018 because I already had money saved up, but for some reason I did not feel ready to leave the traditional college path and enter the workforce, nor did I have the courage to go for college in the US, still. So I did a masters in Conference Interpreting in the same city I did my undergraduate in, which given the current situation with AI, I now regret. In 2020 covid hit, i was 22. And I also went through a horrible break up and had some minor health problems that turned into a mental breakdown. I lost a lot of self esteem and became super depressed, lost my desire to socialize, my motivation to start anew. By then I hated living where I lived, but I was so depressed and anxious, and I had a nonexisten support system. So I stayed and lived in survival mode for what I thought would be a few months, then turned into a few years that now feel hazy. I felt like I didnt know myself anymore, and kept feeling depressed and extremely anxious constantly. I desperately wanted a change but I felt completely powerless. And the few times I mentioned to my parents (I shouldnt have but I made the mistake of looking for support there, when I was unstable and feltalone) that I wanted to move to the US they said it would be a catastrophe and I would lose everything I have in Switzerland (except I hate the life I have here). In 2025 I had finally started to feel more stable for the past year (I was in therapy from 2021-2024). I decided that before moving to NYC/the US I wanted to travel around a bit to see the reality on the ground. I spent six weeks visiting NYC DC PHIL SEA PORT SF over the summer. And although I met people in similar age range and life phase, I also realized, that I had been living in a hole. That there's a whole world out there that Ive been missing out on. Its like all these years of my youth I was obsessed with being financially safe because I knew I could not count on my parents to be truly supportive (they will help me if necessary but with great resentment and chastisement). And that came at the cost of taking risks which would probably have led to happier places. For some reason, did not feel safe starting over elsewhere, even if I wasnt happy here. Anyway. Now Im 28 and I really wish I had moved to NYC sooner. I feel like I missed out on so much being depressed. I was very shortsighted. There's all these things I didnt do. And everyone says that your 20s are your formative years. And Im terrified that I somehow i missed a precious window for development and growth, and that the fact that I did not take more risks somehow defines me. Also, I feel like I have emerged from this extended period of self isolation and everyone else has been living their lives. I used to be very sociable and I want to be that way again and Im very depressed because it feels like im super sensitive and fragile in ways I didnt used to be, so Im less sociable. But I want to be more open again. And also now its like there's been this change of phase, this change of chapter. And people are moving on and I somehow missed out on a bunch of things. I wanted to travel and leave the city I live in now but I didnt even though I had the money, because I was so terrified of starting over but I was so unhappy where I was. Now im finally applying for jobs in nyc, and I know I should not sit around lamenting, which is what I have done for the past few years. I shouldnt regret. But its like I missed out on something huge. And Im a big fan of Kareem Rahma (subway takes guy) who said, in an interview, that moving to NYC at 25 is old, to move to NYC. And Im 28. After years of dreaming, I want to make it happen this year. Anyway. I guess since there is so little positive input in my life, and everyone I know has always said I shouldnt do it because life in the US is horrible, which is what I regret to say influenced and scared me, im looking for some optimism. Im so embarrassed that instead of making my own life decisions, I somehow on some level let my parents opinion, and the opinion of bad, unsupportive friends, be the basis of key decisions at key moments of my life that I now will never get back. It makes me feel violated and also self loathing. And also, its like, if I had moved there sooner Id have had more time to make friends, build a community. I dont know. I just feel depressed. I dont Like who I have become and how I have developed in my twenties. and I have this horrible feeling of doom. like ill never go back to being my joyful, sociable self. like ill never laugh and connect with others the way i used to. and its like, all those years that I could have made memories. I didnt. instead it feels like my twenties were a complete failure. and im very scared that that somehow dooms me to a path of being an unhappier, worse version of myself compared to what i could have been if I had been living in a place I felt I could be myself.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768097154.0, "id": "1q9mtwj", "author": "Admirable_Length1378", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1q9mtwj/feeling_depressed_about_my_life_depressed_i_didnt/"}

She begged that I send her money right now and that she’d come to see me the next day.\n\nI couldn’t help but laugh, and I told her flat out that I would never send her money before meeting her. Yes I know I fucked up by telling her I would then changing my mind. Whoops.\n\nYeah, she deleted her profile the next day.\n\nIt got me thinking. I wasn’t just alone, I was starting to get lonely. I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and PTSD, and I survived being without friends for this long.

Youre not a god, you dont hold super powers.\n\nYour children are going to love you either way. You are going to have to take accountability either way, and youre going to have to admit that it was a mistake marrying that person.\n\n1. You are going to take the long route, where you are suffering forever trying to wear a mask until you cant breathe anymore. That pain will seep into everything else. Your friendships, the way you interact with others, your decision making. Its not going to go away because you avoid it. You maybe even start justifying cheating in the long run because you already checked out.\n\n2. Youre going to break up and take the short route. There is no telling how your kids will react. They will be confused, hurt, mad, angry, they wont be able to understand why you had to do what you had to do…until they get older and become an adult. Then you can explain and they might understand, but still can say they were hurt by it.\n\nThe reality is. Your children we grow up either way, they will realize either way, even if you dont think they did.\n\n“You and (enter partner here) argued so much when we grew up” \n\nAt the end of the day its do you live a life of pain trying to make everyone else happy and live drowning in regret, or do you make changes to make things more manageable and give your children a chance to understand why you did what you had to do.

I am married to a man with severe ADHD and other disabilities that always seem to take precedent over my own struggles. I have such a hard time connecting with people and making friends. I feel like such a shell. I feel like I will be one of those old people that no one checks on because I'm miserable and don't have any connections. All my friendships feel fake. No one really likes me, I am obnoxious and a lot to handle. \n\nGenuinely, I am just tired and ready to stop living. My country has been going to shit. I do not feel stable. I have no generational wealth to help propel me forward. I put myself through school and became a software developer but I don't feel like I'm cut out for it. 2 years in and I still struggle. \n\nPeople keep telling me to go to therapy, go on medication. I have done therapy. I have done a lot of therapy with different therapists. I have done quite a few different medications. I have recently been on an anti depressant for the last month trying to save myself from this drowning and it's not working yet. \n\nI feel so alone. I feel so pathetic. I am snuggling up with my stuffed animal from childhood because somehow that's one of the closest ways for me to find comfort. \n\nI thought leaving my abusive home life would make it better. I thought going to school and getting a decent job would make it better. I thought I wasn't trying hard enough with friendships and went to therapy to work on myself. I hate who I am as a person. I hate the memories I have of my life. I hate how fat and ugly I am right now because I didn't take care of my body and let myself go. I hate the state of the world. I'm not built for this place. \n\nThe sexual abuse I faced as a child. The physical abuse. The homelessness numerous times before I was even 18. I am broken. I never learned to love myself. I was told there was nothing to love. I was a mistake. I am an affair child and my parents hatred for each other supercedes any love they might have for me. They blame my existence and each other for their failings. I am a reminder of their failings. \n\nI had 2 suicide attempts in 2016, back when my CPTSD was at its worse. I ran away from my mom's house and lived on my own for 2 years at that point. My mental health never got better. So I attempted suicide twice within this span of a month. The first time was admittingly more of a cry for help. The second time, I took a hundred sleeping pills and seized and was found frothing at the mouth. I was involuntarily held after that second time. I distinctly remember one of our group meetings where one of the patients said out of everyone there, I worry her the most. Most people who attempt suicide realize how precious life is and never do it again. And I've done it twice, and still actively think about it.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "lonely", "title": "Mental battle with self-worth and connection with others", "text": "TLDR: Text vomit about lacking, wanting affection, and coping with living alone; ig\n\nContext\n\nMy work entails me working night watch (6 pm - 6 am) two months at a time (currently on night schedule), and going back to days for another two months. Been living on my own for almost 2 years. Before which, I had a falling-out with my father, had a major disagreement with my study-group leader regarding my relationship, said relationship falling apart from the tension with her family and me putting an excessive amount of pressure on myself to finish my training (enlisted) and work out everything about moving to my first unit.\n\nLast winter was much harder than now. I wanted to give up everything. I was and am very alone, being 1000+ miles away from where I grew up, from everyone I knew, and my family.\n\nI enjoy standing watch with my co-workers and even call some friends, however outside of work there isn't many get-togethers, especially now.\n\nThe rest\n\nHaving been single the last 2 years HAS been an overall positive for me. I've reduced the pressure on myself to be what I think others believe I should be (leaning into a IDGAF mentality bit by bit). I (mostly) stopped berating myself for my needs, wants, vices, mistakes.\n\nI'm still in a state of feeling lonely. After moving, I haven't found new friends outside of work. One of my best friends from work moved back home (after the military equivelant of getting fired, unjustly btw).\n\nTonight especially, I wish to have a friend or partner to, not really talk, but enjoy their prescence. Hold, kiss, eat with, watch a movie with, etc.\n\nMy childhood kept me very sheltered. Being raised Christian (which is still my personal belief, not actively practicing or attending church; this is for a few reasons) left me stunted, taught my sexual urges were \"of the flesh/not righteous,\" and influenced to overthink about not making anyone uncomfortable/come off as creepy.\n\nThe result was an awkward mess, who wasn't comfortable in himself, wasn't comfortable expressing what he wanted (especially to a woman), what his needs are, naive, chronic overthinker, walker of eggshells.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if people thought I was asexual or something. Especially because of the Christian (practically) shaming of the natural desires (to be clear: the church's teachings, not necessarily theology).\n\nBasically, sex was bad unless it was after marriage, it's a horrible sin to want intimacy before marriage, etc.\n\nAs the saying goes that Christians are the freakiest; I believe that intimacy is normal, healthy, and necessary. Especially before marriage. The boundaries for what goes before and after a marriage is up to each individual, and their interpretation of scripture.\n\nI also grew up with a mother who needed to present a certain appearance, and a father who needed control and supervision (the latter of which was appropriate until my late teens, when it became a point of contention between us). My escape growing up was books, where I could fall into a different world as a reprieve from my own.\n\nFor me, I just didn't get everything I needed from my parents, emotionally. Yes, they clothed me, fed me, put me through school, made sure I was healthy, etc. But (and call it gay if you want) but I didn't have the most supportive or respectful parents. Especially during the last years living with them.\n\nI guess all this to say is I find myself in a mental battle with myself about wanting to hope for what I didn't have up to now, or realizing and accepting my reality that American society has gone belly-up and it's next to impossible for our generation to win (financial stability, relationships, injustice).\n\nDespite my body, job, taking care of my business, growth as a person, etc; I still end up feeling the same, from 15 to 19 to 22 years old. Isolated, unwanted, longing, and alone in how I feel.\n\nIt's no joke that men have their own deep thoughts and emotions. This isn't a \"it'll get better\" or \"you're still young\" situation (imo), since I've heard it for many years.\n\nIdk, thoughts? Ask for context; I share if I comfortable with it.", "score": 6, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768045623.0, "id": "1q924cq", "author": "Stellar_Konos", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1q924cq/mental_battle_with_selfworth_and_connection_with/"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "lonely", "text": "I can relate with some of your points. I too grew up in a Christian Baptist Household. My parents divorced when I was very young and I took that VERY SERIOUSLY! I rebelled not only against them but my siblings too as well as GOD. Well, long story short: I tried to kill myself more than once. I have been hit by a car twice. Attempted suicide/failed. I developed spinal menengitis when I was 5 years old and spent 2 years in the hospital. I have amputations of all 5 fingers from both hands. Amputations of both feet from the ankle of both legs. I am going to have to wear Prosthetics for the rest of my life. I beat myself up for years for the way I looked. I have burns. Scars. Missing teeth. Hair loss. Deaf in my left ear. But God: Who could forgive me for my sins. My trespasses. My unbelief. My brokenness. My shame. I am here today because of Christ's love and sacrifice for me. I have been wrong to myself for a very long time but God was there through it all. He heard my cries. He felt my pain. I am still dealing with pain to this day for some of the reasons you stated. I am still trying to find, keep, experience REAL LOVE IN A RELATIONSHIP. I am still waiting on equality and equity of hearts and minds. Me and God have a great relationship now and I think Satan is jealous of that. I have been in love, yes. I have been in long term relationships for the most of my life, yes. BUT: I have struggled and still been unhappy within those relationships because of differences in direction and feelings. I am probably never going to be married. Never going to have any kids. I am just too different and broken I guess. You have your limbs. You have your health. You have to go and be encouraged to be the best that you can be for yourself first. I am just now putting this into practice at 54 years old. There is hope and you as well as myself have to learn how to FULLY ACTIVATE the good parts of ourselves so that God shines through us.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "lonely", "title": "21F extremely alone.", "text": "I know posting this is a waste of time and I’m just going to sound pathetic here but at this point I don’t really care. I’ve been alone for most of my life, only friends I’ve had have been online except for a few I had when I was maybe 10 years old. But for the most part I’ve just had online interactions and some of them had lasted a good while but as all good things do, they all came to an end. I think probably my loneliness has a lot to do with being neglected and ”homeschooled”. I’m sure if I had been given better opportunities, I would have at least learned how to properly socialize. Unfortunately I suffer from extreme social anxiety and the mere thought of going out induces chest pain for me.\n\nNowadays though, any attempt I make at trying to make friends/maintain them (online of course, I don’t leave my house.) is very arduous and most people already have friends or they find “better” ones which just leaves me all alone again. I’ve never understood why some people claim to have zero friends when in reality they have 20. I personally truthfully have 1 or 2 but that’s including my boyfriend.\n\nI’m currently unemployed and I don’t go to college either unfortunately (could write a whole novel on why) so I guess all of that leaves a lot of room to think about how alone I am too. dont get me wrong, I am in a long distance relationship with someone I care about wholeheartedly, but we’ve had a lot of ups and downs and he just started uni so I know things will probably end between us eventually too. I don’t have many family members that care about me anymore, that is a whole other story but I do live with my mom and most of my siblings but it’s a bit of a toxic environment and I really wish I could move out but due to very unfortunate circumstances, I am unable to and I’m not sure I ever will be able to. I’m in a very depressing place in my life and i find it extremely hard to keep going these days. I feel so depressed it’s hard to stay awake anymore.\n\nI see other people doing really good and they have very supportive parents/families and I wish that was me. I’m 21 now and I’ve still done nothing with my life mainly due to growing up pretty neglected. I have absolutely no direction for my life and I feel like a real failure. Growing up, no-one ever cared about investing in my future or anything and it really sucks. no one taught me about the important adult life things, it’s like I was supposed to just know things on my own. I just don’t know what to do or where to go. Sometimes I feel like giving up is the best route because I am nothing. I don’t think my boyfriend even cares about me because he has treated me awful too. I just wish things were different. I wish SOMEONE would’ve cared about me GENUINELY. I give so much of myself to people and in return I just get pushed to the side once I have nothing left to give.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "lonely", "text": "Hello there, a fellow lonely person this side.\nYour situation kind of matches mine but it is slightly worse in some areas. \nA little boring account of my lonely life is that I have nothing exciting or a happy thing happen to me for the most part of my life. I have always found myself always left out and ending up with no one. Everyone just seems to make their work done out of me and then trash me. It's my fault for being too attached when someone shows the tiniest bit of care and attention towards me. \nNow that I have moved away from home for college the situation is way worse, I thought I might find some new people of my kind, but not everyone is the same here too, throwing me back at the square one that is the ugliest square of loneliness. \nI had my very first crush here for the first time in my life and I can't take my eyes off of her, but on the same day's night I mentally convinced myself that I don't deserve any love and care from anyone in this world and is made alone like this forever. That mental talk with myself suppressed the feeling for now, I hope it never returns as I know that I will forever be a loser. I am very clumsy and very ugly, maybe that is the reason that no one talks with me. I sit alone at the college. In the beginning I thought this would change with time but now I don't think it ever will.\nI think your situation is better than mine. All I got to learn is that trying to force a relationship with someone is never going to work but trying to form a relationship with patience while knowing about each other is what is the ultimate way of any connection.\nIf the person backs away during the first few conversations it is likely that he/she has already rejected you (I know because it is the thing that happens with me 99% of the time).\n\nNow I am not trying to get you to message me from all of this.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "lonely", "text": "Hey girl! first off, I wanna say I'm sorry you're going through that. You don't deserve to feel that way and you sound like a lovely person. I have no intention of comparing our situations bc that's just not helpful, only to say we have a few similarities in our stories. (I'm 20f and similar life/family/social situations) I want to say it'll get better, I have found that it does. but life comes in peaks and troughs. finding community takes so much effort and it's the last thing you have when you're already at the end of your line. I might sound preachy in the next few paragraphs but please bear with me. these are the things I try to convince myself of on the daily so I can keep going. \n\nYou're not a failure, you've just been set up for failure by your circumstances. That doesn't mean you can't overcome them. The first step is to acknowledge that it sucks! It's not fair! You didn't deserve it! Especially remember that it's not your fault. I was in the emergency department a few months ago and a nurse said to me 'it's not your fault that you're in this situation and you didn't deserve it. unfortunately, it's your responsibility to fix it. you have to choose if you want to or not.' Really brutal but I needed to hear that. You have to choose and you have to take the steps to change things but the good thing is you're not alone. Reach out for support! Like you did tonight. This takes courage to do (i know it sounds like a bs line but it's true!)\n\nAlso, I know that you're agonisingly lonely but you have to cull to make space for the people that are meant to be around you. It sounds like you're surrounded by people whose presence makes you lonelier because of the way they treat you. It's really hard, I know, and you might not be able to cut people off all at once but please try setting more boundaries. Something that really helped for me was realising that, yeah, I don't have anyone to look out for me so I have to do it myself. I'll be my own mum, my own family, my own friends. You said that you give so much to people. (Cliche again) What would you do if you had a friend that was in your situation? You'd probably be ruthless with the people that were hurting your friend. So be ruthless. A good antidote to sadness and helplessness is anger. Think about the things you deserve to be angry about and GET ANGRY. Fight for yourself. \n\nIt can get better, I promise. Better doesn't always look like how you think it does. \n\nJust my two cents, and you're absolutely not obliged to take my advice. I'll also offer just to talk if you like. I'm around. There's certainly good people waiting to be a part of your life. Peace and all love &lt;3", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768069516.0, "id": "nytt1iu", "author": "throwawayreksie"}

We own a flat together and next January, the fixed term mortgage will come to an end. I could possibly afford to buy the flat on my own, but I live just North of London. It's expensive. My quality of life wouldn't be amazing. I also have some debt, which I'm paying off at the moment, but as soon as the mortgage comes 100% in my name, I wouldn't be able to afford to pay much more than minimum payments. I'm also a teacher, meaning I can't work remotely at all. So in 12 months, there is a real possibility I'd lose my home, my dog, and my job. Renting wouldn't be much cheaper and because of the debt I own, would be a pretty stupid option, imo. I also currently live around 250 miles away from my hometown and family (in the UK).\n\n  \nSo, I've decided to begin applying for jobs internationally, primarily in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. There are a lot of benefits: significantly higher salary, free accommodation/accommodation payments, the opportunity to travel the world.\n\n  \nHowever... I'm lonely. I have been my whole life. I've struggled to make friends and when I do, I usually end up pushing them away accidently: I'm bad at replying to messages, etc. I actually think I might have ADHD, but that's another problem. Whilst here, I've built a small group of friends, but we speak mainly of work and I don't feel like I can talk to them about other issues. Essentially, I would say I have friends, but the loneliness is still crippling, if that makes sense?\n\n  \nTaking a job internationally would allow me to pay off my debts and save. Selling the flat would also allow me to pay off a chunk of my debt - potentially all of it (property prices have dropped since we bought it, so we will probably end up selling for less than we paid.) It would be a fresh start.\n\n  \nBut then I'm half way around the world. 14-18 hour flight from home. In my head, I envisage this change in me: confident, outgoing, etc, when I can reinvent myself abroad. But what if that doesn't happen?\n\n  \nWhat if I just end up just as lonely abroad, with nothing to help stave off the depression?\n\n  \nI'm scared and I don't really know what to do.

I did not end up getting in my desired college infact i ended up in a place i did not even think about (1 tier college filled with unpolished rural background people)* **.**\n\nSo when i entered college -\n\n1. I was highly disheartened, demotivated, depressed on not getting into my desired college.\n\n2. The people made me hate the college even more , they did not have the manners to speak to walk or to present themselves .\n\n3.

Tried to get into groups but it failed people never chose me , They ignored me , judged me for my looks .\n\nAfter numerous tries and broken friendships i finally got into one group , felt forced but i had no option ( to survive in dental college you need people). I put on a mask on myself, i was afraid of expressing myself freely because they used to judge me . I was the first one to say sorry , i was the first one to console them , I was the first one to help them.\n\nNobody showed up when i needed help, i was ignored . There wasn't even a single day in my first year when i did not cry ( THEY WERE NOT MY REAL FRIENDS I KNEW THAT )\n\n 3Years passed they fought with each other. we were a group of 5 girls. Only 3 of us remain now ( T, A and AAF ).\n\nWe are not true friends. good friends don't talk shit behind each others back but this is what that exactly happens . im being brutally honest i literally vent myself out about them to my childhood friends.\n\nThough we have grown close now, i now freely laugh and express myself ( **which makes me think that time indeed makes the bond closer)** *and ive started to love them .... but still somewhere in my chest it burns , it aches when i remember all the things they did to me in the initial years .* \n\n*Even now i feel excluded ... Ill give you a few instances to explain this....*\n\n*Whenever someone from us comes back from home to hostel we all rush to meet her with big smile on our faces but when i came back last week nobody came to meet me , i also messaged AAf that im back she didnt even open it .

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "lonely", "title": "2026 isn’t looking great", "text": "I’m not really sure what I’m hoping to achieve apart from feeling better by shouting into a void so here I go. \n\n2025 was a year of lots of ups and downs for me. I got onto an apprenticeship which is awesome and is probably the best thing in my life right now but around march I lost all my friends. \n\nI’ve always had pretty severe depression, I’m both on meds and am trying to keep up with therapy to cope but around February I really slipped and had a pretty severe depressive episode. Lots of rhetoric of suicide and I was abusing substances and self harming a lot at the time. That, plus some disagreements I had with some of my friends in general resulted in the whole group leaving me behind. They called me toxic which in hindsight, I definitely wasn’t the best to be around, but in depression mode it just felt like a massive hit. \n\nMy birthday last month was really hard since it was the first one in a long time where my phone was just silent. I don’t really get on too well with my family since we have major religious differences that caused a massive rift (they’re Muslim and I left the religion). So it was just me and my cat which in its own way was nice but I definitely missed having the people around. I don’t really care about celebrating or the gifts but it was nice to have a day where people show up for you. \n\nAnd then to make things worse just before Christmas my cat who was like my emotional support everything got a very serious case of cancer. It developed quickly and she was in a lot of pain and unable to eat so I had to put her down. I still dream of the moment she collapsed when they injected her. I wanted to be with her in her final moments but I feel like maybe that was worse for me overall, especially since i was so distraught with the whole situation I didn’t ask for her to be curled up with me when they put her to sleep. When I think about her in the end on that cold table instead of being able to be warm with me I just break down. \n\nTo top it all off I’ve had some trouble with work because I’ve been turning up a few minutes late for the past week. It’s on me and I know that and it’s dumb but I work hard and deliver above and beyond so it’s frustrating that I don’t get even a little leeway. I know that’s not how the big bad working world works but my mind is just at a low and it’s another thing on top of it. If I lose my apprenticeship my future feels so much more uncertain. \n\nThought the year wasn’t all bad since I finally managed to upgrade from a shitty 2008 Hyundai Getz to a 2021 Mazda 3, and I do love my new car despite some people’s distaste for it. \n\nI’m only 22 and people tell me all the time I have my whole life ahead of me and I shouldn’t be so down and pessimistic and I get where they’re coming from to an extent but it doesn’t change how I feel in the moment. Without my cat my depression feels crippling. I just feel very alone in the world. I’m very socially awkward. I have pretty bad body dysmorphia and feel like a blob so I don’t bother trying to date either. I live in Dunstable (uk) which is a relatively small town so word travels quick and everyone knows each other so it feels like another layer between me and friends. My likes aren’t really in the norm either and I can’t drink or smoke like I used to since I’m regularly D&amp;A tested for my job. \n\nSo how does one make friends that I can do shit with? I feel like a lemon for even asking questions like this but going out and meeting people is scary. I got a gym membership but don’t feel comfortable going so I just sit at home and play games or watch some old tv show I’ve watched 1000 times (currently rewatching bones). \n\nI’m trying hard not to slip back into any form of abuse or suicidal thoughts. I don’t want that for myself again and it’d cost me so much more now than it did before. It’s just very crippling to feel depressed and alone.

A reflection of peripheral youth.\n50 Cent, Tupac, Big, Racionais, Facção Central, a286, Sabotagem.\nBesides classic reggae, because, well, my brother likes that plant.\nThat was incredible, that energy, parties, hanging out in the streets.\nHe's what we call a street kid.\n\n\nMy other brother, how can I describe this guy?\nI was going to describe him, but I'll avoid it, after all it's too intimate, and I dislike dealing with other people's sensitivities.\nBut anyway, my brother, a young man who lived through the same things as my other brother. And decided to be a rapper, yes, he sang in some amateur shows in the neighborhood.\nIt was cool, I went to some, he was a duo, him and my cousin.\n\nHe truly lived, friends.\n\nMy sister, she's cool, she lived through that Facebook era, the peak.\n\nIt was cool, she had lots of friends, and she was always at the mall.\n\n\nThis description only serves to confirm a fact I've been observing.\n\nI didn't live through it.\n\n\nShitty childhood.\n\nAnd now, in this damn adolescence (yes, I'm just a fucking teenager), but I feel like a failure (I know I'm just starting my life).\nBut how can I say it? I'm just a blank slate.\n\n\nI'm not a radicalized guy, I dislike that, it wasn't anyone's fault.\n\nBut damn it, I have to put on my humiliation show.\n\n\nI remember all the times I was there, walking in a group, with people who didn't care about me. I was always left behind, it was like the universe was pushing me.\n\n\"Look, you have to stay behind. Useless.\"\n\nThe bullying wasn't very nice. But I encouraged it.\n\nI had a shitty perception of things, maybe because I never received attention.\nI thought I had to humiliate myself, so I did it, I liked the look of laughter on people's faces.\nSo I spent a good amount of time humiliating myself, I had become a court jester.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nI've never kissed, never dated, and obviously never had sex.\nThat doesn't bother me, I even think I'm asexual.\n\nBut the fact is that I never lived.\n\nI never had a real friend, everything was a shitty relationship. I humiliated myself for attention, they laughed, and that was it.\n\nI was like a dog, they would look at me and laugh, and that was it, no conversations, no hanging out, nothing.\n\nBut that's not the main point, I don't hate my appearance (even though it's a bit worn out), but it's so bland.\n\nI have no style.\nI have nothing remarkable.\nI'm not good at art.\nThere's nothing interesting about me, absolutely nothing.\n\n\nI'm a blank sheet of paper.\nIn truth, I think the only part would be me being a fucking lunatic.\nThere were so many diagnoses after my shitty breakdown. So many medications, so many trips to the doctor.\nI don't feel human, I'm empty, and that's not cool.\nDamn, I don't want to be like this, I just want to be in a park, with friends, laughing, drinking, doing something stupid.\n\nI don't want to be locked in a shitty room.\n\n\nThis is a new year, a new school, I hope for a new chance.\n\n\nI just want to live, just like my family lived.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768031842.0, "id": "1q8yd5m", "author": "Ok_Second1283", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1q8yd5m/i_guess_im_just_too_young/"}

I actually made a friend fairly recently, but I think hes done with me. Hes leaving the state later this year and doesnt want to get attached. Of course the only person who actually sees me as a person worthy of their time has this giant string attached, because I can never just have something.\n\nIm tired of this. I hate coming home to see no one texted me. I hate sitting in my room in my free time waiting for something to happen. I hate thinking of fun things to do but no one to even so much as ask to do it with. I genuinely can not name one single thing I did yesterday. Much less the day before. Last week? Nothing. The entire month of december? Like it never even happened.\n\nI have stuff to do but no energy to do it. Whats the point? It doesnt matter. All it does is pass the time for me. \n\nI feel like I could scream right now at the top of my lungs for a full minute, and it might as well be silent. No one would hear. No one would care. If I stopped leaving the house the only text I would get is from my manager asking why im not showing up for work. If I stopped texting people entirely no one would notice (and in fact, ive already stopped texting plenty of people. They never texted me anyway).\n\nNothing good happens. Nothing bad happens.

Mention of : SA, abuse, grooming.\n\nHi, I'm sorry in advance if this post seems messy, I just need to get it out of my chest even if no one reads it.\n\nI am a 23 yo woman and recently I started to daydream about a relationship I never had and could never have, I always daydream, always had a big imagination ever since I was a kid... But this time is different, at least for me.\n\nThis daydream is about a relationship I'd have with a guy I met in school like around when I'm 12yo, he's two years older than me and the big brother of one of my classmate. We'd fell in love but wouldn't confess it by fear and shyness until my 14th birthday, he'd confess and I'd accept obviously ! My life would be the same as mine, same traumas, same abuse with my mother and with my dad, BUT, he'd be there, he saw everything and stayed. He would choose to stay by my side, help me eat when I don't have the energy to do it, he would accept my fear of intimacy, my awkwardness, and my body, my tainted body. \n\nThe reason this dream is so different from my other one is because I can't stop thinking about it, it's been maybe five months I created this fantasy of that guy and that relationship and I can't get out of it. I guess it's a coping mechanism of what I need in a relationship but sometimes I'm so lost in this illusion that the moment I remember he's not real and just a dream, I end up crying because I'd spend hours in my bed just thinking of our relationship.\n\nMy past relationships were long distance when I was very young, not supervised and free access to internet so you can guess what kind of relationships and risks I went through. My last relationship was in 2016 and the only physical touch I got in my life were without my consent.\n\nWith all this, I feel unlovable, with all those traumas ? With all those things I need ? I just accepted the fact that I cannot be loved properly, I'm not smart or kind or funny or talented or cute or beautiful, I am just a big bag of sadness.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry if this was messy, I wrote this without really any more thinking, just needed to write down this situation.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768017046.0, "id": "1q8tscz", "author": "L0velyChubby", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1q8tscz/im_daydreaming_a_relationship/"}

The situation is made harder because she has repeatedly postponed medical appointments, and it feels like no real progress has been made. I have already spent about a year waiting in this same situation. We have now agreed to focus on the next six months to get her surgery done and help her recover enough so I can begin my studies.\n\nMy concern is that I do not want to waste another six months doing nothing. I spend most of my time at home playing video games, and it is starting to affect me. Although I am introverted, I now strongly want to go out, meet people, and do something meaningful, but that is currently not possible. I have also lost contact with most of my friends, both online and in real life, which makes things harder.\n\nHow can I make sure that, in six months, I can look back and feel proud of how I spent my time?

Later on, she came back to my place saying how much fun she had ‘most people usually skip stuff with her, but i didn’t. I remember asking if she wanted to go to the park and do some jumping jacks, and she just started laughing . Then we were sitting on the balcony just talking i don’t even remember what about exactly, but it felt real, like one of those deep, comforting convos you’d actually wanna have with someone you care about. She ended up staying the night, and yeah, the dream got a little spicy after that (can’t remember much though). What stuck with me was that after, we were lying in bed talking about life goals, dreams, why we wanna do the things we do and i woke up with this warm, kinda lonely feeling. like maybe i just really want someone in my life I can have those kinds of moments with. someone to care for with everything i’ve got.\n\nAlso for the last 6ish month i've been having dreams of having an SO.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767968285.0, "id": "1q89fbr", "author": "Intelligent-Hat-5528", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1q89fbr/had_a_dream_about_connection_and_it_hit_harder/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "lonely", "title": "People don’t put effort into relationships anymore", "text": "I’m a 18 year old college girl and i’ve grown to notice how little effort people, especially my age, put into relationships anymore. I didn’t necessarily notice it that much until my senior year of high school where  my friends at the time put little to none into our friendship. They would never invite me out, I would always have to invite my friends in order to hangout and always waited to have it reciprocated. Ones who said they did want to hangout never carried through with plans, cancelled last minute, made up excuses and hung out with other people they’re closer to, etc. the list goes on. Physically, they were absent but even emotionally as well. Often they would talk about themselves or keep to themselves/keep it surface level. I never got reciprocation with my relationships and even now in college it might even be worse. I’m also coming to the fact that life is only going to get busier as we get older, but purposefully treating and acting this way towards your friends is wrong. \n\nI’ve tried branching out to make new friends but it’s the same every time; it’s surface level, toxic, no reciprocation/effort, or the person I’m talking to shows me why they have nobody real in their lives. I just feel like gen Z specifically has this attitude of “low effort” friendships and that they don’t owe anybody anything when the truth is when you have a relationship with someone YOU DO owe them your presence, that is part of a relationship. You show up for your friends, you hangout, you text, you’re there physically and mentally, etc. I just want real friends or a best friend who enjoy being with me and reciprocate instead of the surface level small talk or only talking to me when they need something. I’m struggling with it a lot and honestly it’s really sad to think about how I barely have any close friends or any at all. I mostly hangout with myself and sometimes it’s nice, but sometimes it would be even nicer if I had somebody to spend my time with. I miss having a best friend to talk to everyday or my #1 go to person to hangout with even if it’s doing nothing all day. I have hope i’ll find my people eventually but it’s really hard to deal with this loneliness and feeling like i’m missing out on life because of it. \n\nIs it just gen Z that is having a big issue with this or anybody also noticing this? I would love to hear people’s thoughts on this matter as I feel like there’s a lot of reasons why people are starting to treat their relationships like whatever. I think COVID did a big number on gen Z, esp in social terms as it genuinely did stunt my growth too. I think social media also creates this illusion of friends, everything is expensive, people are depressed and tired, and gen Z just overthinks too much and has so much anxiety over their FRIENDS who they should feel comfortable with. Please let me know what yall think about this, anything will help but especially knowing i’m not alone on noticing this!

All through middle and high school she made me and all our other friends promise that we would stay friends, like she was very possessive and didn’t like us hanging out with other friend groups. I get it after high school we drifted apart mostly due to me joining the military. \n\nEvery time I came back home though I would reach out to her to try to set up a date/time for us to meet up, I was even willing to come to her because when I left I knew she had no intentions of getting a car or her license as far as I knew. Every time I would message her though she would kind of blow me off. She’s say ‘yeah that sounds fun can’t wait to see you, I’ll be busy as I have these things to do but I’ll let you know when I’m free’ then she’d just never text me back (I’d tell her I’d be back about a month in advance, check back about a week before I’d come home, the day I was home and then a few days into me being home, she’d never get back).\n\nThe last thing I remember telling her was that I had become pregnant and that if I had kept the baby (adoption I wasn’t going to abort) I would love for her to meet them. That message went completely unanswered as well as subsequent messages after that. Including but not limited to me seeing a post about her toxic, abusive and cheating ex bf that I had hated all through high school but still supported her through. \n\nI was going to message her asking her to be my bridesmaid since each of us had promised each other to be in our weddings when I noticed I could no longer see her posts. I had tried messaging her phone number as well but it seems she has changed her number and or blocked me there too. \n\nI just don’t know what to do. What do you do when one of your closest friends blocks you out of nowhere despite the fact you tried to keep in touch with them years after high school?

Its not just me, she will be invited to things and wont see the text until a month later. I love her to death but we never talk and have a 6 hour drive to one another. \nI know how silly and stupid this sounds, but did I just miss the part in my childhood where I learned how to make deep connections that result in long lasting friendships? Im starting to wonder if people dont like me for some reason and dont have a way to tell me. \nIts worth mentioning too- since ive been married, We go out way less and hang out with people way less than what we did when we were dating. Is this normal for couples who have the same work friendships? I feel isolated and like I did something wrong.

You tried to contact her, and she didn’t reply that likely means she doesn’t care as much as you do.

Sometimes people get busy, sometimes they lose interest, and sometimes they simply don’t care and only show fake concern. It hurts when you realize this, especially when your intentions were genuine.\n\nPlease remember that you deserve friends who value you, respect your time, and make an effort for you. You shouldn’t have to chase anyone just to feel important.\n\nWhy don’t you try making friends in your neighborhood instead? Those connections can feel more real and comforting.

I reached the brink of suicide and saw no reason to live, since she was the only person I told everything to, and without her, everything seemed very empty...\n\nFor people like us who form very deep emotional bonds, it can take years to deal with this.

I already had a Disc account, but I had never really used it or joined any servers before. I found a server called VALORANT INDIA and posted an introduction. After that, I didn’t bother checking my DMs because I assumed no one had messaged me, and I also quit Valorant a few days later. Out of curiosity, I checked my account again after about five months and saw that I had 30+ DMs. I went through all of them but only accepted one, because that person had messaged me twice once in February and again on June 15. I accepted his request and replied on June 30. We started talking, and even though he didn’t remember why he had originally messaged me, he still continued the conversation. He was mean but nice at the same time, and he genuinely helped me improve my communication skills. I was very awkward with him and sometimes came across as cold, which I never intended. I just had trouble expressing myself, and I think that annoyed him a bit. I was also caught stalking him online not in a bad way I just accidentally subscribed to his YouTube channel and to me he said \"get a life\" . After that, I felt really guilty and didn’t text him much. About two months ago, he stopped using Disc. I don’t know if he has another account, but my guess is that he wanted to focus on his studies since he’s preparing for JEE. I don’t really have any way to talk to him now, except through Wuthering Waves, but I’m not allowed to play games because of my boards. I know this might sound a bit creepy or obsessive, but I’m genuinely grateful to him. He’s one of the main reasons my social life, which was really bad, became a little better.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "lonely", "title": "Lonely for what I no longer have", "text": "TW suicide\nI have spent most of my life struggling with mental health, much of it stemming from how my parents treated me as a kid. When I was in high school, it began to tank significantly and someone reported me to my year advisor. Since then through all six years of high school he had been checking in with me weekly/fortnightly, sometimes less and sometimes more depending on how I was doing. Towards the end of high school I was at the lowest I had ever been, I had been failing all year, me and my mother had to move houses, my sister (who was the main person in my family supporting me) was getting ready to move out, and there was the impending doom of leaving high school and my support system at school, particularly my year advisor. I had so many other things going on too.  I had been attempting to take my life several times which meant I was having daily check ins, which I guess made me more attached to my support people at school. Graduating was one of the most difficult things I had done, I just had to leave them behind all of the sudden. I went from daily check ins to zero.\nIt’s been more than a year since I graduated but I am still having frequent dreams about talking to them again. They felt like the parents I wish I had but now I’m an adult which automatically means I’m alone and need to fend for myself now. I felt like a thrown out kid again. I visited the school once but a teacher made a “joke” about how I can’t seem to get enough of this place, plus I think it makes me feel worse after visiting. I feel like I’m forcing them to talk to me, and I really have been a big burden on them over the years. Me going back to visit is really just me desperately trying to grip onto what I can no longer have.\nThe year has been so rough and I still feel so lonely. I always hope that I’ll run into them when I go out, just so I can even just say hi again. I feel so dumb for being so attached even after so long and it’s just making me so miserable. \nI’m just too emotional and sensitive I mean like I’m autistic too so idk if that plays a part but everything just feels unfair and I wish I could talk to them again.

I just changed as a person, and went through alot of hard stuff. \nIm coming to the realization that most of my friends didnt like me, and I didnt really enjoy them anymore either. They were all built on need and the fear of being alone. \nFor my part I was such a people pleaser and so willing to destroy my own wellbeing for the comfort of others I was essentially a non person, a mirror of whoever needed my comfort and a fixer. When I stopped doing that, the dynamics of my life shifted. \nI have always been someone with many very close friends. I love hard and big. Im autistic and I often feel like I maybe love a little harder and bigger and louder than the people around me love me. \nI had a major surgery recently, and I was expecting to have at least a couple people reach out that I felt I had gotten close to, even considering the many friendships I had lost, but I only had one person reach out or even respond. \nMy wife has been here for me through it all. But she is one person, and also deserves and needs her own time and space. And I just feel desperately lonely. My family pretty much only contacts me in case of a crisis, or to ask something of me, and Im honestly just burnt out. \n\nI used to be the friend that got someone a gift because it made me think of them. Or brought you flowers and a coffee if you got dumped or fired. I gave thoughtful gifts for special occasions and sent funny stuff about niche interests only they had. \n\nLooking back I cant remember having had a friend do anything like that for me in almost a decade. I dont remember the last time someone checked in on me unprompted except the one person after surgery. \n \nIts been a rough year of homelessness, and health issues and losses of many kinds. \nIm just too burnt out to put any effort into making new friends.

Moving to a small high school, language barrier, already being shy and quiet, being unatractive and unlikable, etc\n\nNow im in college and I still dont have anyone. Its really hard to connect with people. It seems like they all already have their own friends, and im just another student in class. \n\nI wish I had someone to talk to about my interests, or dreams or aspirations, or silly things. My brothers are younger than me, close in age, they like the same things, and they constantly talk to each other. Even my parents are best friends with each other. So my family is good and happy, meanwhile im alone all the time. Im the oldest and a girl, so naturally my brothers dont want to hang out with me as much, and my parents are busy.\n\nAnyway, I've been feeling very lonely lately. Im always lonely, but it is hurting my soul again. Its a deep hurt in my chest, like I am mourning the teenage hood I never had that I get to watch my brothers have together and with their own friends. I had to figure college out alone, where no one seems to want to get to know me. I thought that being a girl would make getting friends easier, online i read that is usually the case. When I was younger, I had hopes of going to college, being friends with roommates, maybe finding someone to like me romantically. But instead i get terrible roommates year after year, and no one who seems interested in being friends or even talking to me beyond school stuff. \n\nThis whole winter break, i havent spoken to anyone besides my family, and I feel like im going crazy. I havent even been able to make or keep friends online, it seems like I am too boring because I dont know or really care about memes, or fps games, or whatever else others seem to like and enjoy. Maybe I should learn to like more things so I can talk to more people. Its just so tiring changing things about myself to be accepted. I lost weight, i understand most spanish now, i try to talk first in groups to break the ice, im not as quiet. Still no one sticks around.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "lonely", "title": "Highschool sucks and I feel like I'm going through genuine hell.", "text": "Every friendship I've had has either broken off violently or faded away this year. Even Lily, who was one of two people who didn't leave me when two of my friends cut ties with me and started spreading rumors. I'm not texting her first anymore because she literally never reaches out to me even when we're in class together and I do not have the emotional energy to be the only one fighting for my friendships. Over winter break I did not text her and we didn't speak for three weeks. I could have died over break and she wouldn't have even known about it until school started again. I just can't handle that.\n\n I've been the one there for everyone else, I've supported everyone else, I've been the shoulder to cry on and the one everyone goes to when they break up and need emotional support, and there is exactly one person  in my life now who hasn't just taken what I have to give and then ran. \n\nI thought a girl liked me and today I asked her out and came to realize I've just been misinterpreting things. I like her as a person but I don't really get romantic feelings in that way so I'm not heartbroken. We'll either continue to be friends or we won't, our friendship consists of me being the only one to reach out (wow what a shocker) a few times a month so it's not devastating if it doesn't, either. But it was the idea that maybe this was the doorway to having a person, someone who would choose me and expect intimacy and doesn't need me to audition just for closeness and losing that hurts. I don't have the emotional energy anymore to be the one to reach out and invest in new friends and nobody cares to do that with me so I might just continue to be this lonely until college at this point. I've survived it, I had the chance to die over break and I didn't take it so I will continue to survive it because for better or for worse I'm stuck here now. But I would be lying if I said it hasn't worn me down so incredibly much. I guess I just hoped this semester would be different somehow.\n\nI know I'm worthy of love. I believe I deserve it and that I'm a good human being, I'm beyond abandoning myself for this anymore. But I also believe that life isn't fair and not everyone gets what they deserve just because they're good people.\n\n  \nI hope college is different but man I expected to have bounced back already and made new friends and recovered by now and nothing has changed externally for half a year. I didn't think this would be such a big deal. I didn't think things would still be like this.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "lonely", "title": "Hyper Aware, Hyper Lonely: To Know my Brain is Only Mine is Profoundly Lonely.", "text": "A brain dump about loneliness, fearing the human mind, narcissists, intimacy, and the weight of my own consciousness. (19F, autism/adhd + assessing for bpd and ocd)\n\nI feel like an alien, like I am not experiencing this world the way it appears most do. I worry people can sense that on me like a lingering bad smell.\n\nAll my life I’ve been unsettled by the fact that every person carries an entire consciousness, as vivid and complex as my own. Each mind is self directed, capable of interpretation, distortion, intention, harm and care in ways I can never fully know. I deeply analyse how everyone around me experiences being human, that I barely focus on enjoying my own experience.\n\nTo know that my brain, my reality, my experience is only mine is an incredibly lonely feeling. There’s only so many words in the English language I could use to try and get someone to understand, feel or immerse themselves in my lonely consciousness. I can’t flip myself inside out for someone to understand me for all my complexities and intricacies. I wish for nothing more then someone to see me for my entirety, even the parts I can’t see or understand, and stay to bare the crushing weight of it with me. But I also wonder if I would even be capable of such vulnerability.\n\nAs a child I was captivated by the workings of the human mind. With that curiosity came a growing fear of the cruelty and inhumanity that people are capable of. As an adolescent, I would watch alot of true crime videos and noticed how disturbed and on edge it made me feel. Trying to understand the mind of the perpetrator was like trying to venture into parts of the human psyche that, as a naive child, I didn’t realise were there. It would especially freak me out to think, we are biologically the same. Humans. I couldn’t wrap my head around how someone could be capable of such evil. But then I would spiral into thoughts (in a less articulate, child like manner), such as “Could this really be a fear of the dark parts of my own mind? The parts every human brain is technically capable of possessing? I could be just as evil as this person and just not realise it?”, Cue the mental spiral from there. This has most definitely manifested into my adult life, as I have huge fears of being blindsided by manipulation, coercion, power. I am quick to put people into the box of “they want to harm me or have bad intentions”, and I think you’ll see more of my black and white thinking patterns in this post.\n\nOn the other side of that, I deeply crave human connection. Intense intimacy, deep understanding, comfortable vulnerability. Only once in my life did I allow my walls to drop, just fall into the trap of a narcissist. A vampire sucking all the life, passion, energy and love out of me, to fuel himself and feel grandiose. Like a balance scale, his side was overflowing while I was left empty. Like I voluntarily entered a cage and blamed it on the pursuit of connection. I was molded, used, manipulated and discarded. After, I spent 2 months straight in bed, screaming and crying until I vomited daily. and am still trying to heal years later. My fears became a reality, I was blindsided by naivety. I’ve never felt so naked in my life, I never thought I would look evil in the eyes and give it my mind, body, soul. What scared me more than him, was that I would’ve stayed until the day I died. I would’ve given him every ounce of me, just for someone to exist with me inside the unbearable loneliness. For better, or for worse.\n\nThe complex ways these experiences have shaped me as a young adult are hard to articulate. There is a reoccurring pain that follows me daily. A brief but abrupt charge of impending doom, isolation, insignificance and unexplained guilt, that pulsates through my whole body and mind. It’s something I struggle to encapsulate in words. It’s more then a thought, deeper then a feeling, but more complex then a sensation. It twists my stomach and piles bricks on my shoulders. It’s like a wave that comes out of nowhere, body slams me constantly and man am I tired of trying to swim through it.\n\nI so desperately want to be able to simply feel peace, feel present and content. I think about changing the external factors around me that I hate. Like my town, my job, my home. I try to imagine starting fresh and think “yeah, that would help most people, but not you”. If anything it reminds me that I cannot escape, there’s nowhere to run. Trapped in brain that is hardwired for hyper vigilance and self inflicted alienation. Trapped behind my two eyes that show me the world with a filter of darkness and dreary. Trapped by my body and its aches and limitations. It feels like there’s too many parts of me to “fix”, that trying is simply pointless. How on earth can I heal and rewire so many parts of me and still keep my head above water in this fast past world, let alone be successful. I don’t have dreams, I don’t have direction. I hate being asked to picture my ‘dream life’, as I’m convinced that as long I live in this mind, soul and body, a life I want to live doesn’t exist. Yet I don’t intend to end my life. If being alive is so full of pain and loneliness, I fear what awaits me in the unknown.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767790882.0, "id": "1q6erb3", "author": "Hour-Brilliant878", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1q6erb3/hyper_aware_hyper_lonely_to_know_my_brain_is_only/"}

That alone takes some self-awareness which a lot of people don’t have.

The quiet nights listening to music, gaming, anime, it’s cozy and it’s safe but it can also highlight that gap the “someone to share this with” feeling. You’re already owning your life in a lot of ways self-care, work, hobbies, confidence in what you bring. That’s huge. The next part, finding a woman you connect with isn’t about “magic” or “game” as much as it is about connecting over shared moments, being vulnerable and showing that you care in ways beyond the physical. Your humor, your music, your presence those are your bridges and the truth is the people who vibe with that will come often when you’re least expecting it. Maybe it’s about taking little steps talking to people who share your interests, letting yourself be a bit more open in everyday interactions or even just sharing your world online or locally with others who get it. Not forcing it, not chasing perfection just letting the genuine parts of you be visible. The right person will see that also it’s okay to feel lonely. That’s not failure that’s human.

How has the friendship aspectin my life has been so far.\nSo im gonna divide this into two parts. Part one is gonna be about my childhood and schoolfriends.\n\nPart 2 is going to be about my college friends.\nSO YEAH .... Ive always been an introvert girl with a shy personality. I don't talk much until I'm comfortable with the other person and the surroundings, I have a stern face (don't look approachable) so making friends have never been easy for me. I did not have much friends in my school up until gth grade. I used to be alone during lunch breaks, I used to be alone during picnics or even in class but that never bothered me, I was happy in my own world I was happy being with myself.\nI had friends in my residential apartment\n... MY BESTIES We basically grew up together, we laughed we fought but everything is forgiven in childhood friendships ( OR AS I MAY SAY THE AGE IS SUCH !\nINNOCENT YOUNG CHILDREN). 6pm to 8:30 pm used to be my playtime with them...and I used to wait for the clock to strike 6 and I would call my friends and run to the playground....LIFE FELT AMAZING I COULD FEEL EACH AND EVERY SECOND OF IT.\n\nThen came 9' standard ..THIS WAS THE TIME WHEN I FINALLY FOUND MY TRIBE MY PEOPLE HAHA. We didn't even realize when we all became such close friends. We were 14 people, me and my other friend (GAP) we were the only girls rest all of them were boys ( YOU SEE IVE ALWAYS BEEN WITH BOYS THAT IS WHY I HAVE SUCH A HARD TIME IN MINGLING UP WITH GIRLS).\nLife felt great!\n\nThen came the year of 2020, we had to shift to another city because of my dads business, This meant that I had to leave them, I had to leave those people for whom I had prayed to god for, those with whom ive laughed the most, those who felt like family.\nI shifted but promised myself that I would keep in touch with them and trust me I tried my level best to do so. Always up or calls. lways messaging them updating them about whats going on in my life.\nBUT SLOWLY THE CALLS REDUCED THE MESSAGES DRIED UP/ SILENCE OVER THE PHONECALLS\nINCREASED. No matter how hard I tried to hold on to them they kept slipping away.\nThat early college phase! The age when you actually grow up! When you learn how to drive a car ! when you have your first drink! when you have your first cigarette! They did all of that together They grew more close whereas I just drifted away. I WAS ALL ALONE.\nTHEY MET DAILY... I MET THEM ONCE IN A YEAR. THEY HAD THEIR OWN JOKES NOW AND I WAS NO LONGER A PART OF IT.\n\nIt hurt it really did. ive cried a lot of because of this. And ill be honest I am very jealous of them. jealous of their friendship. I now talk to only one of them (out of 14 people. no one is interested in talking to me somewhere. also left it because I had grown tired of it I could no longer keep on holding after seeing that the other person had totally given up.\n\nThey all meet when they come back from their colleges during their vacations ( IT ACHES) ...Even when they know that im in the same city they never call me never ask me to meet them .. YEAH WE HAVE COME TO SUCH A POINT ....ive accepted it but it hurts it hurts a lot because I deeply love them im so attached to them...it has been 6 years since ive shifted but there isn't even a single day when I don't think about them ...there isn't even a single day when I don't think about rushing back and just hug them.\nI love you guys.

You’re not alone on how you feel and it’s good that you’re at least trying to be healthy while you’re struggling with it. \n\nThe boredom and nothing to distract you is honestly the worst thing about being lonely, but there are some ways that work for me personally. I’m not sure what your hobbies are but hobbies help me out even though I don’t have very many! I play video games, listen to music, write, hang out with myself, talk to people (both online and/or irl), clean, do something i’ve been putting to the side, etc. You don’t need a companion to go out in public and enjoy yourself; even doing small errands like grocery shopping or buying a little gift helps me take my mind off the void for a little bit. I will say as well that being around people in public like a mall, even if you’re not talking to anybody, can help ease the depressing feeling. Just having people physically be in your presence helps me out a lot. \n\nI hope these ways help you out in some way and anyone else reading this comment. Any other questions or ways I’d be happy to answer the best I can. I know what it’s like to have that endless pit of loneliness sitting in your body and it’s not fun but you make best out of the situation you’re in.

No messages, no calls. Just long stretches of silence in my apartment. After a while it starts to feel unreal, like I’m watching my life instead of living it. Around my family, I mask it well. Too well. I show up calm, functional, normal enough that it’s easier for everyone—including me—to pretend I’m okay. I think the topic of my loneliness is uncomfortable for them, so it never really comes up. It’s easier to assume I’m fine than to open something none of us know how to handle. Because of that, I feel like I’m on my own with this. Not abandoned—just unsupported in a way that’s quiet and unspoken. What makes it worse is that I technically have freedom. I’m an adult. No one is stopping me from changing my life. I know what I want to do. I know the steps. And still, I don’t have the courage to do them. That freedom—having full responsibility for my choices—feels like a prison. There’s no obvious obstacle I can point to, so the blame turns inward. I feel like I’m wasting time. Like I’ve failed at something basic everyone else seems to manage. Each day I stay stuck, that feeling gets heavier. I wish I had someone to lean on while I figured this out. Someone who could just sit in it with me so it didn’t all feel like it rested on my shoulders alone. But it doesn’t feel like that’s an option. It feels like it’s up to me—and I don’t trust myself enough right now to carry it well. I still function. I work. I eat. I get through the day. But underneath all of that is this constant sense of being trapped by my own life, frozen by choice, and quietly disappointed in myself for not moving. I’m not posting this for advice or reassurance.

As a 22M guy, having never done anything with a woman does definitely weigh on me a lot, and it would be easier to think “it will happen one day” if I didn’t have these few issues, so I’m going to dissect each of them below. (For context, I’ve written so much stuff on my profile, so if you want to see more info about other issues, feel free to look.)\n\nHeight: this one is arguably the least damaging of the 3 I’m going to mention, but being 5”5 is not helpful, and on average I’m the same height as most girls, if not shorter, which does not help me in finding someone, because it doesnt give the safety asset most woman crave.\n\nLeg: when I was 5 I had a brain injury, which after dying twice, having my skull cut in half to stop a bleed, and waking up paralyzed. I currently walk with a limp on my left leg, which once again, is extremely unattractive. It’s not mild, but rather big, but it’s not genetic which is nice to know for me. \n\nPersonality: this one is one that’s starting to get on my nerves, because I have a very camp personality. I prefer to get on with woman than men, my best friends a girl, I currently live with 6 girls, and I’m very over empathic, passionate and emotive in the way that I speak and act. Everyone I’ve ever met has assumed I’m gay, and I’ve been hit on by so many guys it’s insane. (I’m not btw). It’s weird though, bcoz I like to act like the man, and I like protecting woman. It makes me feel more masculine which is a nice feeling.\n\nIt just sucks to think that individually working past these issues is feasible, but all of them together just add up to, there is no way there is a girl who would want this kind of guy. I also need to accept that I have preferences too, and I have to like the girl as well. It just seems realistically impossible for me. \n\nI do wanna hear what you guys think though, anyone out there who’s been through similar and worked it out?

And you may have a limp, but I’m glad you’re here! Brain bleeds are no joke and you made it out alive and that’s the most important thing.

I didn't quite have the vocabulary within myself to describe it to others or myself, but somewhere I knew to myself that if I told anyone they'd likely not believe. Albeit I was young, I had read about pedophilia in the magazines, but I couldn't quite get around to saying I could've said to those who cared. I tried to live with it as if nothing happened, and I wilted away further and further. I learned to lie, to deflect, to never having to face up to any oncoming confrontation. \n\nI began to live with a quiet desperation, I wanted the things other boys my age had, or that's what I thought - I was chasing the feeling of not knowing of the horrors that most kids do not have to encounter, and I wanted to fill this hole in me that kept growing by the day. I didn't have the words on me to share it anyone I knew, not that they'd understand, but as the days passed and I tried to find glee in my own company, I grew dimmer and dimmer in the face of all the subtle ways in which society first starts making you aware as to your shortcomings and your place in the schematics of the world. I wanted everything, and the smallest jibe regarding my skin, or my hair, or me not having this or that toy, it gnawed at me. I could never let it go. \n\nAt first I started lying about having those things, and those lies unraveled ever so quickly and caused me even more embarrassment. I couldn't take it and started getting more violent and aggressive, trying to shut down any murmur as far as my deficiencies were concerned. I couldn't ever make my inner murmering, formed out of the small niggles and heartache caused by the words and gestures of others, go quieter. \n\nEvery relationship, every small victory, every happy feeling I've ever has come with the baggage of being unsure about whether I deserve this, will I lose it in time? Today, I see people ogling at handsome men, rich men, this men, that men - I feel like an outlier, cause there's no one who has even remotely loved what I am.

And I have nothing…\n\nWell I have a job at least, it pays minimum wage and is probably the worst place to work ever but at least I got some money in the bank, soon enough I’ll be able to buy a fancy car- and Piper Rockelle just made 3 million dollars in the first HOUR of her OF being live…\n\nNo matter what, I’m falling behind.
