I’ve been bugging her about it for months now and her reply is the same she says she lost the phone. The phone is a very old iph 6s that was my aunts . Should I just let it go or ask her to pay it back but at a small cost. This is really bothering me because she shows no remorse for losing it and the reason she borrowed it was honestly really petty. There was a recent college exam in our city and I noticed she was really desperate for the scholarship it just so happened I took it first and when she asked me about it I said that my proctor was so chill and I jokingly said I could have cheated on it if I wanted to. So she borrowed my old phone so that was the one she surrendered. I m really conflicted what should I do? I didn’t react yet because I honestly feel like there’s no use for me to be mad cause the phones lost already but at the same time I feel like it’s very unfair that I have to deal with this while she suffers no repercussions for her actions. Losing that phone really is an inconvenience to me because I use it as a dummy phone. I honestly feel very upset towards her because she tried passing the blame off to me at first saying she had given it back even though she didn’t and when I asked her that if she did give it back when and where that was when she couldn’t reply this is the part where I feel hurt and disappointed towards her.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768048648.0, "id": "1q930v9", "author": "Real_Body_9855", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q930v9/what_should_i_do/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "The gift of sensitivity", "text": " am a sensitive person. I used to hate that about myself. Sometimes I still do. For a long time, it felt like a curse to feel so deeply especially on my darkest days, and man, those days felt unbearable. My sensitivity trapped me in my feelings and made me dwell on pain longer than I should. I used to pray to God to make me different, but instead, He showed me the beauty that comes with having an emotionally rich inner world.\n\nI realized that my life is a lot more colourful than most people’s, which makes life a lot more beautiful. Some people have never experienced listening to music and being touched in the deep crevices of their soul to the point of crying. If you are sensitive, you are also most likely an empath, meaning you can connect to emotions through movie characters. You can feel every emotion as if their feelings were your own, and if you’re like me, you can even connect with villains. That’s why this year I vowed to watch more movies to experience the colourfulness of my inner world through my sensitivity.\n\nThis doesn’t only relate to movies but to real life too. Sensitivity also allows you to see people who are unseen. You can feel people’s emotions even when they try their best to hide them. That is ultimately why the world needs people like us. We notice the small things through our feelings. It feels like a curse a lot of the time, but it is also such a gift. I’m not going to lie I’m still learning to love this part of me because no matter how hard I try it will not go away. Just in case you’re just like me I hope this shift in perspective will help you appreciate your sensitivity a little bit more ❤️", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768047942.0, "id": "1q92t4l", "author": "Anxious_Upstairs7365", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q92t4l/the_gift_of_sensitivity/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I can't get over my first love", "text": "I wanted to post this for a while because I can't tell anyone in real life. I know I will get a lot of hate for what I'm about to say but I can't handle keeping it inside anymore.\n\nI (F26) dated my first love when I was 16 for a year. It was a crazy \"puppy love\" kinda thing. Very intense, we argued but we were also making out for 3 hours. The classic first love dynamic. Too young to have a stable relationship but the feelings were real. We ended things because I've caught him texting a girl and we tried to make it work after that but we were both so immature I told him after a few months I don't want to do it anymore. So after a bit more than a year it was over.\n\nRight after it we both got in new relationships, they lasted a few years. He would text me every once in a while (like once a year) and we would text for a few weeks (hiding it from our partners). No nudes or anything but there was some flirting and stuff. Our attraction is undeniable. But in our fashion we would always then get into an argument and stop talking for a year until he texted again.\n\nFast forward to now. We both have \"new\" partners. He's been with his girlfriend for 2 years and I've been with my boyfriend for almost 5. I love my boyfriend and I want to build a future with him. We are on the same level on almost everything. Today I went shopping for some clothes and I saw my ex with his girl and I've never seen her before. I haven't seen him in more than a year. We all just said hi. My heart started racing and I was sweating. Now I came home and my heart feels so heavy...\n\nI've never cheated on my bf with my ex. But he has texted me since I've been with him but it was just a bit before he got into this relationship. He was all flirty, we had coffee without my bf knowing (i know it's bad) and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted me but I went home. The thing is that it can't work between us.  I know this sounds bad but there is a huge intellectual gap (think I'm doing PhD and he barely finished high school). He has a really good job with good salary so it's not about the money. It's just we don't have much to talk about. It didn't bother me when I was 16 but it would now. \n\nSo I know that it wouldn't work. I'm happy with my bf. Why can't I stop thinking about him? Why do I feel so bad now that I saw him with his gf? I feel like i will never be as attracted to anyone as I was to him when I was 16, full of hormones and not a single care in the world. I admit I'm still attracted to him but fully aware it wouldn't work. In a weird way just knowing he wants me makes me feel so good. Like whenever he would text me before and I would see he still wants me... I would feel so confident and empowered. Now I think he's really serious about this new girl. And I want him to be happy. But I'm dreading the day I find out he proposed. I don't want to marry him. But I don't want him to forget me. \n\nI don't know what I'm asking. I don't know why I'm writting this. I just know I can't say it out loud. Does anyone ever really get over their first love? Is it normal that the attraction is still there? I don't know if it is normal for me to feel this way.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I don't want to live anymore.", "text": "This is my first post and honestly I don't want to share all this pain but maybe someone could help.\nI am 21(M), currently in 3rd year B Tech. My life was really good from beginning, good school life with good friends. And I got a good college with computer science branch which I always wanted to pursue. Everything was good but then I got sick. \nI was diagnosed with atopic dermatitis which is a skin disorder. It all started with small bruises in my hand but it spreaded quickly. The doctors gave me steroid medication and it resolved the disease. But everytime, it keep coming back with more intensity. \nMy skin got so thin that just pressing it would instantly make it bleed or it water started to come out. I couldn't sleep due to itchiness and pain. My skin used to shed every day and my bedsheet was covered in water and blood. The first two semesters passed somehow but my grades were very low. I couldn't attend the 3rd sem and barely passed it.\nMy condition was so bad that I wasn't able to stand straight. I wasn't able to fold my arms because of the cuts. My neck was not moving and bathing used to feel like someone is pouring acid on my skin. I used to feel cold even on sunny days because my skin was completely damaged.\nAdditionally, my body got tanned, it was pigmented and swelled. My face would look not human, like a monster. This has severely impacted my self confidence. I started to stay inside, and avoid any possible social contact.\nIn 4th sem, they gave me year back due to attendance shortage. I could have passed the exams but they didn't even allowed me to write them. I was really sad because I was once a topper in my school. \nI went to my hometown for 3 months and recovered a little. I came back to join the college with juniors and cleared 4th sem and then 5th sem. Right now I am on methotrexate which is also a very strong drug. Though my dosage is very small but I have to regularly get my blood checkups for any anomaly. \nI am physically recovering but my mental health is very disturbed. I don't have any friends or people with me. I lost my school friends and couldn't make any new ones in college. People know me but not personally. I joined clubs, thanks to some editing skills I learnt in lockdown. But everyone seems so invested in their own lives. \nI live with my mom but I can't share my thoughts with her because I can't see her worried. My parents already saw me in pain for 3 years. I am the eldest among all my cousins so I can't tell them also. I don't have anyone who could understand this. \nI just want someone who can talk to me. I can't rely on chat gpt for this. I need some form of human connection. I can't sleep with all this trauma and I barely get sleep. Whenever I go outside or in my college, I see people happy, talking and laughing. I just sit alone and hoping to be a part of them. \nMy parents doesn't force me to study but they keep hoping that I become successful. I know hoping is not bad, but they sometimes compare me with others. Their hope is justified because I was once a very good student. \nRight now I have started working out, I do coding and video editing sometimes. But even after doing all this, I don't feel good or proud. I think the only way to end this pain is to end myself. \n\nI don't want to live but I am so coward to even commit suicide. I just hope my life end in an accident. \n\nThanks for reading so far... and pardon me for any typos or grammatical error.

It’s not hatred, and it’s definitely not something I’m proud of. Being around kids makes my body go into fight-or-flight mode. My chest tightens, my thoughts race, and all I want is to leave. Loud noises, unpredictability, sudden movements, and crying overwhelm me in a way I can’t just get over, no matter how much people tell me it’s normal or that I’ll change my mind one day.\n\nWhat makes it harder is the constant social pressure to like kids or to see them as inherently joyful. I even have nephews, and while I care about them and want them to be safe and happy, being around them for extended periods is incredibly stressful for me. That contradiction eats at me. When I say I don’t want children or that being around them stresses me out, people immediately assume I’m cruel, immature, or broken. I feel a lot of guilt about something I never chose, especially because I know kids are just being kids.\n\nI avoid family gatherings, public places, and even certain friendships because I’m afraid of being put in situations where I’ll panic and then be judged for it. I’m working on understanding where this fear comes from and managing it better, but I needed to get this off my chest because it’s isolating to carry around something that feels so socially unacceptable.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "You need professional help. Letting a phobia rule your life is really bad for you, and it’s not something you can just ‘get over’ on your own. People will start taking your mental health more seriously when you take it seriously - see doctors, therapists, psychiatrists about helping you. You may never enjoy being around children, and that’s fine, but being filled with terror around children is no way to live, and it can be dangerous for you and for people around you - there was a situation where a guy shoved a co-worker in front of a car because he had a phobia of birds. He didn’t do it purposefully to hurt his co-worker, he just needed to get away from the bird and in his blind panic his actions led to someone else’s severe injury and ruined their career. So it’s very important to work on your phobia with a professional, not so you can frolic in the park with your nephews, but so your fear doesn’t make you freak out and impact on yourself and the community around you.\n\nThere’s a world of difference between disliking spiders and having arachnophobia. And so it is with you, plenty of people find kids annoying to be around, but a genuine inexplicable fear of children is different. When your family pressure you, explain it like that. It’s not just a dislike or misunderstanding of children, it is an inexplicable fear that you cannot explain or control. Phobias are not rational and this is not your fault.\n\nI would also draw the line at calling it paedophobia unless you’re talking to a mental health professional in confidence. People are easily on the alert if they misunderstand terms and think you’re a risk to children - vigilantes once attacked a paediatrician because they didn’t realise it just means ‘children’s doctor’, and not paedophile.

Again, that’s okay, sex is sex - live your life. My problem is the fact that in the messages, she says “I’m sober, he was drunk as fuck though.” Come again? I’m sorry, what did you say? \n\nShe did not clarify whether or not she was drunk too. If she was not drinking, I am absolutely mortified. I have a bad past with that and have been taken advantage of both under the influence and sober, so for her to do that really hurts especially since she’s aware of what has been done to me. Besides my personal experiences, I think it is wrong to do in the first place because whoever is intoxicated is not in the right state of mind to be having sex with someone that is. \n\nNow, I could be jumping to conclusions with that one, but the other problem is if she was drinking, she drove them back to her place. It’s not new for her to get behind the wheel while intoxicated, she drives after smoking weed a lot (I do not support that at all), but now drinking and driving? With another person in the vehicle at that? I cannot look past it as again, I grew up around alcoholics who have gotten many DUIs in their lifetime, I’ve seen the consequences and losses that come from drinking under the influence.\n\nI am not trying to make anything about my personal experiences, it’s just what I think of when these things happen, but this time I’m honestly starting to spiral because how could my best friend do it? I’ve trusted her for so long just for her to do this? Again, I’m not expecting her to think about me at all, but she’s well aware of what this kind of stuff can do to a person and she still willingly did it. That is what bothers me, the fact that she did it to someone.\n\nI asked if she was sober or not during the act and she ignored it, only answering my other questions like his age and whatnot, so I know one of those scenarios are true and she doesn’t want me to freak out at her. I don’t know if I’m overreacting and making it about myself, but I can’t wrap my head around why she would do any of that to anyone, and to herself if she was driving drunk. \n\nTL;DR: My best friend either slept with someone super drunk while she was sober, or she was drinking and driving, and I don’t know if I can be friends with her anymore over it.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "[M22] Mental battle with self-worth and connection with others", "text": "TLDR: Text vomit about lacking, wanting affection, and coping with living alone; ig\n\nContext\n\nMy work entails me working night watch (6 pm - 6 am) two months at a time (currently on night schedule), and going back to days for another two months. Been living on my own for almost 2 years. Before which, I had a falling-out with my father, had a major disagreement with my study-group leader regarding my relationship, said relationship falling apart from the tension with her family and me putting an excessive amount of pressure on myself to finish my training (enlisted) and work out everything about moving to my first unit.\n\nLast winter was much harder than now. I wanted to give up everything. I was and am very alone, being 1000+ miles away from where I grew up, from everyone I knew, and my family. \n\nI enjoy standing watch with my co-workers and even call some friends, however outside of work there isn't many get-togethers, especially now. \n\nThe rest\n\nHaving been single the last 2 years HAS been an overall positive for me. I've reduced the pressure on myself to be what I think others believe I should be (leaning into a don't give a fuck mentality bit by bit). I (mostly) stopped berating myself for my needs, wants, vices, mistakes.\n\nI'm still in a state of feeling lonely. After moving, I haven't found new friends outside of work. One of my best friends  from work moved back home (after the military equivelant of getting fired, unjustly btw). \n\nTonight especially, I wish to have a friend or partner to, not really talk, but enjoy their prescence. Hold, kiss, eat with, watch a movie with, etc. \n\nMy childhood kept me very sheltered. Being raised Christian (which is still my personal belief, not actively practicing or attending church; this is for a few reasons) left me stunted, taught my sexual urges were \"of the flesh/not righteous,\" and influenced to overthink about not making anyone uncomfortable/come off as creepy.\n\nThe result was an awkward mess, who wasn't comfortable in himself, wasn't comfortable expressing what he wanted (especially to a woman), what his needs are, naive, chronic overthinker, walker of eggshells. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if people thought I was asexual or something. Especially because of the Christian (practically) shaming of the natural desires (to be clear: the church's teachings, not necessarily theology).\n\nBasically, sex was bad unless it was after marriage, it's a horrible sin to want intimacy before marriage, etc.\n\nAs the saying goes that Christians are the freakiest; I believe that intimacy is normal, healthy, and necessary. Especially before marriage. The boundaries for what goes before and after a marriage is up to each individual, and their interpretation of scripture.\n\nI also grew up with a mother who needed to present a certain appearance, and a father who needed control and supervision (the latter of which was appropriate until my late teens, when it became a point of contention between us). My escape growing up was books, where I could fall into a different world as a reprieve from my own.\n\nFor me, I just didn't get everything I needed from my parents, emotionally. Yes, they clothed me, fed me, put me through school, made sure I was healthy, etc. But (and call it gay if you want) but I didn't have the most supportive or respectful parents. Especially during the last years living with them. \n\nI guess all this to say is I find myself in a mental battle with myself about wanting to hope for what I didn't have up to now, or realizing and accepting my reality that American society has gone tits-up and it's next to impossible for our generation to win (financial stability, relationships, injustice). \n\nDespite my body, job, taking care of my business, growth as a person, etc; I still end up feeling the same, from 15 to 19 to 22 years old. Isolated, unwanted, longing, and alone in how I feel.\n\nIt's no joke that men have their own deep thoughts and emotions. This isn't a \"it'll get better\" or \"you're still young\" situation (imo), since I've heard it for many years. \n\nIdk, thoughts?

He was the oldest in our friend group, and was like a older brother figure to me. \n\nIt happened in his room. We were laying down on his bed, and our conversation was around porn. He started to show me porn. I was aroused. He then got on top of me, and he started to rub himself on me - I was aroused. I remember enjoying it. There was frotting (rubbing) and little oral. It was mostly non-penetrative sex. But he tried. I don't remember much from this first experience.

Few times, I deliberately  went into his room for this opportunity. That time I didn't know much about intimacy and sex. \n\nIt would start the same. He would come on top of me, remove my clothes, and started to rub. He would usually stop after he came. And he would leave the room to clean himself up, while I stayed in room, still rubbing by myself. I felt pathetic, and wanted more. \n\nThis happened for a couple of years - until it stopped.  \n\nMy second experience happened quite recently. All was same, except I was in a different place, and with a different person. This person was also like a older brother figure to me, and he was married. I went to stay at his home, because he was leaving the country. His wife had already left with his newborn. \n\nAfter drinking, we went to his room. We talked for a while. I began talking about collage and how hard it is talking and getting with girls. I went on and on, and he started to hug me. I didn't think much of it at that time. As it went on, I started to get uncomfortable. But eventually i got away and pretended to sleep. He was disappointed - i felt bad.\n\nI heard him moving, and when I opened my eyes I saw him on top of me. He started to rub on me - i remembered the same sensation when first experienced it when I was 11 years old with the other guy. I felt disgust, but I also remembered the pleasure. He asked if i wanted to continue - i said YES. \n\nHe proceeded to remove my clothes, and began doing it. He instructed me to get off the bed, and go on the floor. As I sat on the floor, I started to regret everything. But i didn't have the courage to stop him. I didn't want him disappointed. \n\nIt was same as before. I was being rubbed against another guy, and I had to give an oral. I hated it. But he wanted more. He started to penetrate me. I opposed it at first, and he seemed to have listened. \n\nBut when I was on my back, he came on top of me, and prevented me from getting up. He started to penetrate. It was painful. I started blackout, and dismissed my mind from the current situation i was in. I was lucky that he came early. So he wasn't able to penetrate me fully. \n\nHe went out of his room, to clean himself up. It was the same as before. I was on the floor. I tried rubbing myself, but i didn't get aroused. I felt miserable and pathetic. I went straight home the next day and closed myself in my room.\n\nHe is now out of my life, and busy starting his new life with his wife and his baby. Same as the other guy. Both of these guys were in the same friend group when we were little. And as my friend group grows smaller, I feel alone. I don't have many friends. Both of them were my only best-friends.\n\nI feel ashamed that I was even aroused from all of these sexual experiences. I think of myself as the victim, yet i was enjoying it? Now I'm very sensitive around the topic of intimacy. If I do find myself with a girlfriend or a wife in the future, I would be afraid of initiating any form of intimacy. I feel like I would be doing the same thing, I hated, to them. \n\nI hate this. I hate feeling aroused as i recall these events. I hate myself.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768041700.0, "id": "1q91157", "author": "spinaleater", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q91157/i_feel_hate_myself/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Letting go of childhood friends", "text": "Ok this has been bothering me. I know the right answer but why does it feel like such a security blanket letting go.\n\nI(31F) has been best friends with Anna (31F) since we met freshmen year in high school. We have always remained close despite me moving across the country 5 years ago. Before I moved I had distanced myself from Anna because she was very negative and critical of me all the time. I just stopped hanging out with her but remained in contact with her via groupchat with our other childhood friend, Beth. \n\nLast September, I flew to Texas for the first time since I moved in 2021. The plan was a girls week at Beths house-3hrs north of the town we grew up. I was flying in and Anna was driving...When it comes time for me to buy my plane tickets to Texas, Anna kept coming up with bogus excuses and doubts if she would be able to make it- as if we hadn't been planning our reunion all summer. I decide im going to visit Beth regardless if Anna comes or not. A week before my flight, Anna reluctantly confirms shes able to join us. I immediatly notice Anna has gained a lot of weight, hair is messy, dressed in a oversized hoodie and leggings(even in the texas heat). Anna has a history of depression but her apperance was alarming for the overall lack of effort put in to this special occasion of seeing each other for the first time in years. During the trip Anna was pretty typically herself except she did tell us that she would only be able to come for 2 days because she starts a new job...Day 2 of the trip Anna abruptly starts telling us goodbye and she needs to get on the road to go home. Whatever Beth and I say bye and keep the party going. The next week, Anna text us casually that shes flying to California to meet up with some gamer friends she met online.... Ever since this I havent said anything directly to Anna in our groupchat and do not respond either. Anna was stressing about money to drive 3hrs to hangout at her friends house with her girls but can easily fly to California for some randoms?? Anna not making seeing us a priority was really hurtful and I stopped giving a sht about staying in contact to be a supportive friend for her mental illness because of it. \n\nAnyway...Fast forward to now, I am in a really happy, new chapter of my life and I don't want anything draining or negative energy in my life. I just got married in October and I want to focus on creating the life we want. Me and my husband are taking a few months to do some traveling in Asia. I want to cut off everyone who doesnt understand why I want to travel and want to start a new life. I am more protective of my life and choosing people who choose me back. My childhood friends never left our small town and dont see the significance in traveling. They dont get me-to say the least they are very conservative. I am the opposite- we have legit nothing in common anymore. I want new friends and I always felt comfortable knowing Anna and Beth were always a call/text away so I admittingly didnt put in the effort to maintain new friends. I guess coming to the realization that I need to move on is hitting now that im married, in Asia, in a new career path, and freshly 31. I want to get rid of the things i feel are holding me back in order to make room for new friendships, opportunities, ideas, etc. \n\nDo you think it worth me announcing that I no longer see the value in our friendship or should I just quietly exit? \n\nThank you for reading my rant.

I'm 23 years old, I'm a woman, I live with my family, and my brother is only 11 years old. I was chilling on the couch, watching TV, it was around 11:30 PM or so. Usually, he's already asleep since around 7 PM, 8 PM at the latest, so I didn't even pay attention when I heard some strange noises coming from his room. I thought he was playing on his phone or something. But time went by, and I kept hearing sounds of videos, moaning, that kind of stuff... then I got suspicious and decided to go into the room to see what was going on. When I opened the door, girl... I froze. My little brother, 11 years old, naked from the waist down, touching himself and watching porn on his phone. I was in total shock, I couldn't even speak properly. I closed the door quickly, took a deep breath, and went back to talk to him. I sat on the bed, tried to stay calm (because yelling or freaking out would only make things worse) and told him that what he was doing wasn't right at that age, that he's still very young, that his body is changing but there's time for everything. I explained that masturbating isn't the end of the world, everyone does it one day, but that watching pornography at that age can be super addictive, mess up his head, create unrealistic expectations about sex and relationships. He ended up opening up and told me that it was his friends from school who showed him, that they exchange links on WhatsApp, talking about it at recess... holy shit, right? An 11-year-old exposed to all this crap already. I tried to teach him boundaries: I said that if one day he wants to watch some video again, to look for me, that I'll help him choose something less heavy or explain things. And I even said that if one day he wants to try something (like kissing someone or whatever), to talk to me first, that I'll guide him, protect him, not let him do stupid things with anyone. But now I'm here questioning myself like crazy: did I do the right thing? Was I too permissive? Should I have forbidden everything right away, taken away his phone, told my parents?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "TW: Domestic Abuse: I Grew Up in an Abusive Home, and I’m Terrified It Will Cost Me the Life I Want", "text": "I have been holding this in for too long and I don’t know who else to tell so I am posting it here.\n\nI, 25F, have grown up in an abusive household all my life. My father was and still is emotionally, physically and mentally abusive—first towards all of us, but later on, now, just my mother. My brother and I have only a year’s gap between us so we have seen a lot of stuff together. On many other occasions, he has been caught in the act, both emotionally and physically, but as a south Asian woman, despite all this, my mother is just expected to “stay” because as per society (this includes our own family) “he provides for you and your kids, feeds you, clothes you and provides you a roof over your head.” Which I, for a fact, believe is absolute nonsense. If you are part of a brown/desi household, you will know exactly where I am coming from. A lot of things have happened in the past—a lot of fights, arguments, toxicity, drama, neglect, abuse and God knows what else. It is a rollercoaster. \n\nI have become pretty much numb over the years. In my teenage years, I used to feel everything so vehemently, and was always trying to “fix” every matter between my parents. I, as the eldest daughter, have this in my blood—the urge to treat things like a project and try to fix them; I have this inherent quality to be hotheaded and just keep giving and giving until it drains me. How stupid I was to think that my efforts and tears would matter to them—that a crying child, begging them to stop would make them throw hands and tend to her instead. Teenage was a very dark period of my life where everything was do or die, but mostly just die. It wasn’t anything serious, but my intention was pretty clear—that I wanted this life to end, for all this madness to just stop.\n\nI feel nothing but pity for my mother. She went against her entire family to marry this man, only for him to treat her like this. She still regrets it, every day, I can see it on her face. She has let herself go completely, especially after my grandfather’s (her father’s death) a couple of years back. She doesn’t dress up, doesn’t put on makeup, doesn’t dye her hair. She looks older than she is—and the fact that my father has not supported her at all during this time says volumes about him not only as a husband, but also as a person. Instead of comforting her, he has always thrown the death of her father in her face like an abuse.\n\nOver the years, I will admit, the physical abuse had stopped, until recently. There is no logic behind the supposed “arguments” they have. It’s not like I haven’t tried to talk to him (both calmly and angrily) that he can talk and argue all he wants, just not raise his hand at her—nothing was learned, never was, never will be. I have stopped trying to “fix” this whole ordeal. I am merely my mother’s unpaid therapist and a punching bag to just feel absolute shit to not be able to do something about it.\n\nIt is because of their relationship that I have seen over the course of my entire life, I had decided to never get married. It wasn’t until I met a wonderful man last year that I thought to myself, “God, I would want nothing more than to be his wife.”\n\n Things just changed in my heart, and all I knew was that I wanted a family with him. He takes care of me, loves me, cherishes me like I am the light of his life. \n\nOne day, while on the phone, I was crying and I expressed my household problems to him, waiting for judgement, yet, all I was met with was love and comfort—something I failed to find in the arms of my family. Love with them was always conditional—if I did what they asked me to, fulfilled the goals they expected of me, just become the best good daughter, love was guaranteed. \n\nWith him, it came naturally, like I wasn’t doing anything special to please him. Upon hearing all this, he told me how proud of me he was, and he was right here with me. I really do love him, so much so, I want to cry sometimes that how did I get so lucky with him.\n\nOur marriage talks are in progress, both of our families know about is, but I am worried—my childhood and all this mess will come to bite me in the ass, though this is something that is and always will be out of my control, it still makes me worried. What will his family think if they find out? I am so embarrassed and tearful just typing this. I don’t want my father’s deeds to come onto me. I don’t deserve this. What if because of all this, they don’t think I am a good fit for their son, as I come from such a background? My father’s side of the family is uneducated, as well. It makes me think what if this will cause a problem for me specifically? \n\nI have full faith in my partner that he will not let this happen, but still, my own concerns are eating me alive and I am rotting day by day. I drown myself in work and try not to come home—I have gym and other activities aligned in such a manner that I only have to come home and sleep.\n\nI don’t even know what I am trying to say anymore; this doesn’t feel like a home, it feels like a prison where I have timed breaths. I dream of starting my own family with my partner, but these concerns haunt me—what if he turns out to be the same as my father? What if I have to face my mother’s same miserable fate? What if my children have to go through all the things I did during my childhood?\n\nI don’t know. I **am so tired.**\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI grew up in an abusive household and became numb trying to survive it. My father still abuses my mother, and I feel powerless to protect her. I found real, unconditional love for the first time and want to build a family, but I’m terrified my past will follow me, define me, or repeat itself.

Thousands of dollars in credit card balances without knowing how my check will pay for everything. I currently have 17 credit cards. I bought into the credit card game - “use your credit cards GET THE POINTS.” Years later I’m in a mountain of credit card debt with 10s of thousands of dollars in credit card bills. Even with a Multiple six figure job - the household bills make it difficult to make progress on my debt. \n\n\n\nHow I’m working to dig myself out: Step 1) luckily was able to consolidate all my debt and now I have one manageable payment. \n\n\n\nStep 2) Working myself out of it! Luckily I’m in a profession where if I put more hours in - I earn more. I’m also working on some entrepreneurial ventures and hoping those help me gain financial freedom in the future. I’m worth more than my debt. I will get out of this and learn not to live above my means and stop buying into the stupid game credit card companies play with the so-called incentives, ie, traps, points, and cash back. They get 30% Return on investment when they only offer us 3-5% cash back which is insane but it works.\n\n\n\nI write this to give others in massive debt strength and hope that we will get out of it. Also if you have any suggestions I would appreciate any good advice on money management, budgeting, anything that would be helpful in my situation. TY My Community - Excited for my next checkin.

would realize this was wrong before i did it and stop the whole situation. but he never did. i gave him head and i was good at it too, because i wanted him to feel safe in what he was doing and then really get hurt/paranoid. i hated him and myself and wanted to mess him up. he was moaning and swearing. maybe my mom got the feeling something was up because like two minutes in she called us from downstairs. he immediately came in my mouth and i felt it hit the back of my throat like acid. remembering this feeling puts me in a state of distress/humilation to this day. i cried about it this morning and i have several times since it happened, knowing i will never be able to erase that feeling from the memory of my body. after he came i got up and puked it all out in into the toilet. up until this point i felt like i was winning/had power in the situation but as soon as this happened i understood i had been used, and i had let someone use me, i had harmed myself and allow myself to be harmed. and that even though i had willingly done this, i was still in going to be in pain/carry this memory with me for a long time  \n  \nafter, i immediately went to my room. he came with me. he told me that i shouldn't tell anyone what happened. he made another advance and i just stared at him. some days later, he left. i decided not to do anything about the situation and put it to bed. 6 months later i confronted him and he denied anything ever happening.  \n  \n3 years later i told my mom and his brother that something had happened. i told them that i had technically consented. my mom said that it was his mistake and my mistake and i agree. but i was the only one who was harmed- i did threaten that i would tell others when i confronted him and this messed him up for some time but genuinely hes okay now i can tell from his vibe. now hes successful and doing movies. i still remember the pain i felt when i understood that if i could have seen into the future and known what the actual feeling was like i never would have done it. again, i still have the memory of his cum hitting the back of my throat and just feeling so ashamed and disgusted with myself. this emotional memory, and the fact that i will never get any honest apology, or even just admitting that this happened, how i would be rude to him after this incident and he would ask why i was being rude like

my mind, this would be painful but i could handle it and then i could just use it to hurt him further. in his mind, i enthusiastically consented and that is that.  \n  \ndefinately i was hoping he would realize this was wrong before i did it and stop the whole situation. but he never did. i gave him head and i was good at it too, because i wanted him to feel safe in what he was doing and then really get hurt/paranoid. i hated him and myself and wanted to mess him up. he was moaning and swearing. maybe my mom got the feeling something was up because like two minutes in she called us from downstairs. he immediately came in my mouth and i felt it hit the back of my throat like acid. remembering this feeling puts me in a state of distress/humilation to this day. i cried about it this morning and i have several times since it happened, knowing i will never be able to erase that feeling from the memory of my body. after he came i got up and puked it all out in into the toilet. up until this point i felt like i was winning/had power in the situation but as soon as this happened i understood i had been used, and i had let someone use me, i had harmed myself and allow myself to be harmed. and that even though i had willingly done this, i was still in going to be in pain/carry this memory with me for a long time  \n  \nafter, i immediately went to my room. he came with me. he told me that i shouldn't tell anyone what happened. he made another advance and i just stared at him. some days later, he left. i decided not to do anything about the situation and put it to bed. 6 months later i confronted him and he denied anything ever happening.  \n  \n3 years later i told my mom and his brother that something had happened. i told them that i had technically consented. my mom said that it was his mistake and my mistake and i agree. but i was the only one who was harmed- i did threaten that i would tell others when i confronted him and this messed him up for some time but genuinely hes okay now i can tell from his vibe. now hes successful and doing movies. i still remember the pain i felt when i understood that if i could have seen into the future and known what the actual feeling was like i never would have done it. again, i still have the memory of his cum hitting the back of my throat and just feeling so ashamed and disgusted with myself. this emotional memory, and the fact that i will never get any honest apology, or even just admitting that this happened, how i would be rude to him after this incident and he would ask why i was being rude like nothing happened, just makes me feel helpless the way i did before  \n  \nanyway that is my story think whatever you want to. i have told the truth from my side", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1,

I’m not excusing my actions or saying what I’m doing is okay at all but you need to know some things.\n\nFirst thing is that this relationship is more like a disaster ship, once again I got rushed into a relationship too soon and now I’m trapped. If you look at my post history you’ll probably find another post of mine regarding a boyfriend of mine, this may offer perspective into the way my relationships go and the kind of men I date. Secondly some insite into my current boyfriend (M18) is loud, aggressive, sassy, and lacks common sense, this really overstimulates me  (F16) who has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and adhd along with a few medical issues that cause me physical pain daily is obviously bothered by this and his other actions.\n\nThird I’m going to tell you out of everything he has done In the last few months, the worst thing he did has to be the time he got drunk at my friends party, hit me, embaressed me, and ruined the entire party. I’m going to attempt to sum up what happened that night because I’ve been trying to forget about it. I pulled up to my friends birthday party (had her whole family at it btw) and my boyfriend is already there and visibly intoxicated, I asked him to bring me some vodka because I knew he had some. I don’t drink publicly because I hate being drunk around others, drunk people also overstimulate me a lot. Anyways, I asked him for the vodka, I grab the bottle and set it aside for when it’s just me and my friend. He chugs a Gatorade with vodka in it. I tell him to stop, I say I’m serious please don’t drink anymore. 5 mins later he grabs the bottle, and he takes a large sip. This made me visibly upset and I grab the bottle and put it back where it was supposed to be left alone till way later. What I did not know at the time and the thing that may have made me most upset, is the fact that when I left that room he chugged more vodka. Not too much later the whole party moved from her room (friends) to the living room with her family, my boyfriend still being visibly intoxicated. Her family is not okay with underage drinking mind you. He’s acting so poorly I tell the birthday girl what’s going on and that he needs to go sleep it off in her room (the most logical solution to me) and we take him to the room stumbling the whole way and effectively pissing me off. For the majority of the party I had to try and convince him to go to sleep  which didn’t work at all. He was loud and annoying and kept trying to get back up from the bed saying he was “sobered up now” he was not. He got up, his friend told him to lay down, “no”, his friend pushed him back onto the bed. The bed I was sitting on. Boyfriend ragdolls, arm flops out and closed fist strikes my nose and slightly breaks it. Ow. What the fuck?? I was pretending like I was fine and eventually I went outside to go cry on the curb next to my car alone. A few of my friends come comfort me, it’s cold out so we get in my car to chat and vent. The rest of that party was stressful and makes me upset so we’re going to move on now that you can understand how this relationship has been so far. You may be wondering, why stay? I don’t know. Up until a few days ago I still enjoyed his company and being his partner. But, a week ago my boyfriend was hanging out at his exs house, and he was taking selfies in the bathroom with 4 girls one of which being his ex girlfriend. He has done this before and I told him it made me uncomfortable. I wasn’t happy to see him doing it again , so naturally I communicated it as such. And… he left me on read? Weird.. suspicious even. I don’t put up with bad behavior so I posted on my instagram note “the concept of my bf being friends with his ex” this ofc got his attention and he reply’s with “not my ex”. He thinks that just bc they dated for a few months and thought they were better off as friends means that they “never dated”. But they dated for at least 6 months so they definitely dated, this was also sus to me and I was just really upset. I had texted him n I message and he ignored me until I posted something (he was actively on his phone ignoring me) I said I thought it was funny he couldn’t answer my text message but was able to reply to my instagram note. He took offense and reply’s with “geez what is with you” that obviously made me upset so I replied with “oh!” I was then left on read on everything and I was upset and crying. You may be wondering what I meant when I said I was cheating on my boyfriend in the title, enter lets call him J (m16) he replied to the instagram note and I explained the situation to him, and for the first time in a while i felt seen and heard by some one. After that conversation we kept texting throughout the week and eventually we hung out and i had a really good time, i as after this that i realized i had developed feelings for J and grew to despise my boyfriend even more. I have to wait until February to break up with my boyfriend but i would never physically cheat on my boyfriend. I am however having an emotional affair with J.

I’m finally losing the weight and improving physically, which not only has me at the lowest weight in 3 years but has me beaming with confidence, all so I’ll be ready to leave for enlistment, I’ve been working at this for months and it’s all finally coming together, the paperwork is done and I’m all set to leave in 2 months. \n\nI’m finally stress free with my finances, I have everything figured out and I’m no longer drowning the same way I was the past few months. \n\nI got my dream car, a mustang which while may not have been the smartest purchase has been the biggest win I’ve had so far and genuinely make me happy. \n\nI even met a girl, someone who genuinely makes me smile everytime I hear from her, someone who lights up my day and I’ve actually been able to connect with, even with topics I was always scared to be open about, even with the closest friends I had in my past. \n\nI’ve become way more outgoing and confident, no longer the anti social, pessimistic and introverted person I was before, I can make friends now, I can hold up a conversation without judging myself and I no longer dread human interaction.\n\nMy life has improved so much in the past 3 months and yet I’m not happy, I know why, the same reason why I even started working so hard towards all of this, because I lost my second half. The girl I thought I would love for the rest of my life, my twin flame, my soulmate, the person I genuinely thought I would spend the rest of my life with. \n\nI’m not grieving the same way I did when it was fresh. It doesn’t burn my soul and leave an empty void when I think about her anymore. I don’t regret every action I’ve ever taken when I look back at our relationship, I don’t cry anymore when I try to sleep and recognize the emptiness I feel when I roll and realize she’s not there anymore. She’s not the first thing I think about when I wake up nor the last when I go to sleep like so many nights before. I’ve accepted that we’ve ended and I’m trying with all my might to move on, and I have, and so has she.\n\nWe’re still good friends, we each couldn’t just leave each other completely, we tried and it broke us, it returned me back to a state of looking for a release from all the pain something to my drown sorrow in and it did the same for her, we both started drinking, heavily. But it relaxed once we reconnected, we had always talked about staying friends if things ever went wrong, we didn’t want to hate each other, we didn’t want to hate ourselves. And so we started talking again.\n\nWe had our fun, I will admit we did things that I regret, we sunk back into our old ways and became closer physically than we had any right being after we broke up, especially after she started talking to her now boyfriend, who at the time she treated like a side piece, someone we actively talked down, who we snuck around and kept our relationship a secret from. I will admit it had a charm to it but it also made me feel extremely guilty. I think it got to her too, because we finally stopped and I don’t want to start again, part of me just wants to be rid of her completely, as harsh as it sounds, I just want to let that chapter of my life close, but I just can’t let go.\n\nIt’s so easy to dismiss her when we’re apart, I can distract myself, but when we’re in person it’s like a pull neither of us can resist, we go back to the way we were, make each other smile in ways only we would know how, we laugh, we joke, we tease, we let our guards down in a way only those who’ve truly laid out there entire souls can. And yet we both know it’s not what we want, we both want to move on, I want to move on.\n\nAnd the problem I face now is I am, I’m moving on and I feel even guiltier than when we were messing around behind her bfs back. Every text I receive from my new girl lights up my heart in a way only she had before, and yet it’s such a bittersweet moment before I realize that spark had been gone from the two of us for so long and I just didn’t want to admit it. That I had been so unhappy with the girl I “loved” that our texts became a chore for me, that her coming home was an annoyance and a distraction from what I wanted to do. That this final breakup was our third to date and just proved how much we should’ve ended things sooner. We both did things we regret to each other, we both hurt one another in ways only we could’ve, and yet we stayed because we felt such an overwhelming connection. \n\nAnd yet with every text, with every celebration, with every happy moment I have as I move on, I ask myself why couldn’t I feel this way about her, why did I have to let my ego get in the way, why did she have to hurt me the way she did, why isn’t she the one I’m sharing these moments with, why did we need to split apart.

A remnant emotion not even I can spark a light again, even with how much I miss her and the desire I hold to hold her in my arms again.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "What To Do When You Realize You Might Be Losing Your Closest Friend?", "text": "I think I’m beginning to understand that I may be losing my closest friend of 9+ years and I don’t know whether there is anything I can do to stop it.\n\nFrom the very beginning, we were different people. She was always disciplined, deeply perseverant and intensely committed to her studies. Responsibility came naturally to her and grades mattered a great deal, sometimes everything. I, on the other hand, was a bit slower in my rhythm. I studied closer to deadlines, disliked rushing, procrastinated more than I should have, yet still chased perfection in my own way. Grades mattered to me too, but they were never the whole story. Even our tastes, like movies, music, fashion, food habit, etc rarely aligned. And yet, somehow, we bonded.\n\nFrom the outside, we were seen as the “top duo” of our class.. the inseparable best friends. But beneath that image, an invisible competition quietly existed between us. I began to notice that whenever I scored higher than her or received more attention from teachers, her behavior toward me subtly shifted. And when she did better, I won’t deny that I sometimes felt a sting too. But I tried, earnestly, to celebrate her wins. I told myself she deserved them, that God had granted her success, and that I had no right to feel anything but happiness for her.\nThe comparisons never stopped. Friends, teachers, even parents constantly measured us against each other.\n\nAfter graduation, our lives diverged by physical presence, but we kept in contact virtually almost all the time. She secured a pretty relaxing job in a quieter, more peaceful city, one that allowed her to balance work and studies. I, however, entered a demanding job in a bustling city, spending hours in traffic every day, returning home exhausted (not immediately, but later). Health issues complicated things further for me. For 2-3 years, she prepared for her postgraduate exam and finally succeeded on her 3rd attempt. I couldn’t even prepare properly, so I didn’t try at all.\n\nWhen she passed, I congratulated her sincerely, multiple times. I truly was happy for her; I knew how much pain she had endured after each failure, and I had been the one to console her, to lift her spirits, to remind her of her worth. She had earned this moment. \n\nA few days later, my father learned of her success, and with it came another round of comparisons. I felt crushed, but again, I told myself: She deserves this. Around that time, I was already emotionally overwhelmed and had another exam the very next day. I didn’t reply to her messages.\n\nTwo days later, she texted me something along the lines of:\n“I know you’re transparent. I understand what you’re going through. I hope you overcome it.”\nI asked her to be direct.\nShe replied:\n“You know exactly what we’re talking about. It’s normal to feel this way. And if something good comes from a bad feeling, that’s better.”\nBefore I could respond, she deleted that message and replaced it with:\n“It’s nothing, leave it. By Almighty, you can do it if you try.”\nI still haven’t replied nor seenzoned it yet.\n\nAnd I don’t know how to.\nMy mind feels overcrowded with thoughts I don’t know how to organize. She has been my closest friend, the center of my small circle of six or seven people. I’ve always been deeply introverted, someone who struggles to express thoughts, to show vulnerability. In high school, I was even bullied for being too quiet. In medical school, the only friends I truly made were her and a few others I became close to through her.\nI’ve often been perceived as moody, perhaps because silence is my default when I’m overwhelmed. When I’m sad or confused, I retreat inward and try to carry everything alone. She did take care of me in her own way, I acknowledge that. She often called me her closest person. Yet, somehow, I almost always felt overshadowed.\nWhen I tried to share my family traumas or emotional struggles, she would redirect me back to studying, as if feelings were distractions to be overcome rather than realities to be held. Over time, I stopped opening up. Still, I accepted her as she was. I respected her. I wanted her to be happy.\n\nShe used to tell me we would pass our postgraduate exams together.\nNow she is achieving her dreams. I am genuinely happy for her. But deep inside, I know things will never be the same. I tried to keep our conversations light, normal, like before. Yet she brought up the one topic I desperately wanted to avoid. I know this is her moment to shine, her moment of triumph. No matter what I feel inside, I don’t want to dim that light. She deserves every bit of attention she worked so hard for.\nBut when she directly pointed to the very insecurity I was trying to quietly manage, it felt unbearable.\nMaybe this is where our parallel paths finally diverge. Maybe change is inevitable. I don’t know if I will ever feel equal beside her again. I feel inferior.. and then ashamed for feeling that way. I don’t know how to save this friendship, but I also don’t want to carry the guilt of being the one who ruined it.\nSometimes, disappearing feels easier.\n\nI don’t know what to do.\nI only know that something precious is quietly slipping through my hands, and I am trying, with whatever strength I have left, not to let it break me. \n\nHow do I respond to her with dignity?\nHow do I protect myself without appearing bitter or pitiful?\nDo I deserve to keep my self-respect intact while facing her? \nIs this friendship truly ending, or simply transforming into something so unknown or too unfamiliar to deal with?\nHow do I learn to exist without feeling overshadowed, without blaming myself for everything that falls apart?\n\n\n\nSorry for the long post, but I'd really love a bit of an advice &lt;3", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768033728.0, "id": "1q8yvwt", "author": "Sadiabae5", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8yvwt/what_to_do_when_you_realize_you_might_be_losing/"}

What I've also understood is that these are suppressed feelings, that sometimes I might be frustrated by or angry at something or be uneased, and then I just let it be and a lot of things add up slowly and slowly.\nWhat I've realized since is also that I have a lot of 'steam', you know when people say 'let off steam' ? I think that's what I need. If i have so much of it deep down, I have to channel it out firstly by journaling at a fixed time as discipline everyday and secondly by doing something about everything, and also to make myself healthy. An active body really helps towards a healthy mind and a more stable flow of emotions, and I think gym does that for me. If you let everything out slowly, and then maintain your emotional balance as well and still keep your body and mind going as a healthy form, you can avoid letting anger and frustration seep out on those little inconveniences that don't warrant that big a reaction.\n\nAnd that imo is the first step of dealing with your own emotions, particularly negative ones. And hey, you probably already know this, but you are still a human for having them. Infact since you want to actively improve it, that makes you a kind person too.

Said that there's a lot of job opportunities here, so I packed my things and moved. Its been about half a year now. I still have no job. I've been fortunate that the rent here is extremely cheap, I cook, and clean, and he works and pays the bills and groceries. I feel pathetic and worthless about not contributing.

I can only work in places that are within walking distance which is quite frankly, nothing. If I get a job in the city It has to be within the path of my roommates drive to his work or school. And I also can't work past 10pm for his sleep schedule. But that's too unpredictable for me to feel comfortable. What if he can't drive? What if he goes out of town? What if I work later, or earlier?

We were both decent at studies, both awkward, and ended up in the same batch. At first, we just studied together. That was it. Or at least that’s what I told myself.\n\nAfter classes, we’d sit and help each other with backlogs. This was before smartphones were everywhere. Internet was expensive. We used our parents’ phones and bought scratch cards just to text. Most of the time it was just, “Are you coming today?” but it still felt important.\n\nSlowly, she became part of my routine. I’d adjust my tuition timings to match hers. She did the same. At night, around 11:30 or 12, we’d chat on Facebook — not the app, the web version, because apps meant more data. Almost every night.\n\nShe could sing really well. Sometimes I’d ask her to sing a song, and the next day she’d record it for me. I don’t remember the songs now, just the feeling of knowing she did it for me.\n\nWe were both big Cristiano Ronaldo fans. She used to joke that she’d only marry Ronaldo one day. I laughed along, but somewhere in my head I started believing it — not literally, of course, but in the sense that she deserved someone perfect. Someone confident. Someone like him.\n\nAnd I wasn’t.\n\nThat thought stayed with me.\n\nShe introduced me to her two best friends. They were nice to me. One day, one of them asked me directly if I liked her.\n\nI said no.\n\nNot because I didn’t. But because I thought she was out of my league. Because I didn’t think I could ever be “enough.”\n\nHer friends asked me again later. And again. Every time, I said no. Each time, it felt easier to lie than to risk losing what we already had.\n\nThen a friend of mine proposed to her. That’s when everything hit me at once. She didn’t accept him immediately, but instead of finally being honest, I pulled away. I became quiet. Sometimes rude. In my head, I acted like she was “mine,” even though I’d never had the courage to say it out loud.\n\nThat probably pushed her away.\n\nA couple of months later, she started dating him. He told her a lot of bad things about me — things that weren’t true. She stopped talking to me completely. One month before boards, I wished her luck. She replied, “Same to you. Maybe we won’t meet again.”\n\nWe didn’t.\n\nHe blocked me everywhere from her phone — number, Facebook, everything. Years passed. I never really forgot her.\n\nIn 2022, she unblocked me. I sent a simple message asking how she was. She replied politely. Normal. Like someone I once knew very well.\n\nThat was it.\n\nNo confession.\nNo closure.\nJust something unfinished that still sits with me.\n\nI guess I’m writing this to say — if you like someone, say it. Even if you’re scared. Even if you think you’re not enough.

You should try to address the underlying issues that are causing you to feel this way. Easier said than done for sure. But start forming real life human connection. Branch out and start making friends. Start talking to people at school. Meet girls/boys. All that. That’s the only way to fulfill the desire for connection you describe. You need to put the effort into forming and fostering real life interpersonal relationships. Not online, not in video games. Real people, real life. Nothing can replace that.\n\nI have no clue what an 18+ audio even is. But I’m just assuming it’s like listening to porn lol. It’s not that there’s something inherently wrong with that.

By fucking up as a teenager! If you’ve never dated AT ALL as an adult you’re not gonna know how to all of a sudden just because you’re older. Older people know because they are older and have years under their belt not just their age! If you’re 26 and never had any job you’re not just gonna automatically know how to do said job! If you’ve had years of experience in retail at 26 and now you’re working at Michael’s of course you’re going to know what to do you’ve done it before!\n\nBeing a bumbling idiot at romance and sex at 16 is a whole other deal than at 26!!!!

It is not fun learning to date as an adult!!!!!\n\nAnd fucking sex I know it’s going to be bad that’s another one people say sex is bad when you’re young that’s because you’ve never fucking done it!!! Even if you wait till you’re a “mature” adult if you’re a guy you’re dick probably won’t work anyway just like a 16 year old kid cause you’re nervous and you’ll be a minute man and if you’re a woman it’ll still be fucking weird and uncomfortable like you’re 16 cause you’ve never had fucking sex ever!!!!! That’s not fucking fun to experience as an adult!!!!!\n\nIt’s so fucking frustrating! People who say this don’t know how crippling it is as an adult not knowing how to interact romantically trying to learn when most people at this age except you to know!

Let's call him O. During our relationship he was extremely abusive in every way, on substances, etc etc. Mind you we were Freshman (in HS) at the time. We had talked on and off since, but since he was into drugs he had assaulted me more. The reason I went back is because he said he was quitting, which in the end was a complete lie... but regardless.\n\nHe ends up introducing me to his friend group, we had some mutual friends which was nice and I made some new ones along the way. One stood out to me in particular, we will call her D for simplicity as well. D was gorgeous, funny, sarcastic in the exact type of way I could understand, I was secretly smitten and we started talking and flirting quick after meeting. O caught onto this and within 3 days of knowing eachother... asked me if I like D saying that she liked me back. Of course I was honest, said that I did like her kinda but was still unsure. He then took this as the chance to put us all in a gc, tell us to fuck, and then pressure us to get together.\n\nI was mortified. D was too understandably. I remember texting her and profusely apologizing, but she did like me too but wanted to take it slow. But she did tear into O for outing me like that with no basis on her end. D said something about how she wanted to take it slower and not rush relationships as that doesn't go well for her... and O took that in offense as he and his current partner dated within a day. D and O blocked eachother, made up, whatever.\n\nA week later, I'm consistently talking to D and having genuinely an amazing time... when I get a sudden text from O. O confessed he still liked me, and I didn't know how to respond. Did he ask his current partner? Did they break up? All those things crossed my mind; but I rejected him for my own sanity. I was really shocked and so I told D because we were romantically talking at the time, to O's knowledge that we liked eachother. Commence another fight. But it dropped quick.\n\nFast forward to Dec 30th. I have a dissociative disorder and was pretty blurry at the time, to O's knowledge. He was high. I was talking about my disorder when he made a joke and ended it with \"fuck you\" and so I replied in a JOKING way, \"not rn\" as most people in our friend group would have responded. But he took that personally and all of a sudden started whining about how horny he was, flashed me himself shirtless, and then tried to pressure me into sending back. I admittedly was going into my fawn-defense mechanism and just politely rejecting and making excuses... all of that, and managed to get him off of me.\n\nI woke up that next morning and told D, and she was rightfully pissed. O not only tried to get me to cheat on her, but also O tried to cheat on a partner of his own with the excuse of polyamory. D and O got into a huge fight, understandably so. I was too scared to defend myself before, hence all the other times I have been assaulted. D in defense decided we were dating now, and so that's how it happened. O threatened to turn the friend group on me, saying I didn't belong, calling my now gf a t-slur and an f-slur, and calling me pathetic and that my other friend is gonna hate me for this. I ended up pre-emptively messaging some friends and D and I showed them the screenshots, including O's partner. They all sided with me, though O's partner didn't break up with them.\n\nA few days ago, O texted from his partner's phone, blocking D in disguise. I was confused as O then texted me and saying I was a good person for his partner and to stay friends. I was so confused. When O's partner, J, got their phone back... D was understandably upset. Someone she wanted no contact with broke it so easily. D went off the rails on J, pressuring them to break up with O (which I agree with in some ways, O is controlling and an abuser) I was terrified of this as I HATE conflict due to trauma and whatnot. J messaged me something for D and I sent it to her, and more shit went down because of it... and J and D are no longer speaking and I can't help but presume it was my fault.\n\nI deleted the message I sent to D from J... as I was panicking. D asked why I deleted it and I admitted that it was because my anxiety was really bad. And since then, she hasn't spoken to me. I have sent a few texts since then, today being the only day I didn't in case she needed space. But I'm really scared of being abandoned again. She lives in Europe and I live in the U.S. so there is a big time-difference though we have made it work.\n\nShould I try and talk to her and make this work? I don't wanna be pushy, but I know things are hard for her. I just can't help but feel like I am a bad luck charm wherever I go now. I always have been and always will be.

I had a partner for that long, same ages, and I hated him. He became a more horrible person by the day, but I was afraid of the loneliness and the change. I dealt with violence out of fear. None of it was worth it ultimately, and I could’ve found happiness much sooner in life if I dint let fear dictate my choices.\n\nI am 26, so not too much older, and I don’t really have friends. I get the same feelings you do, and some days it sucks. But…why not go *do* something? Alone? \n\nThere’s something so uncomfortable but empowering to choose to go to a little cafe or restaurant alone. Why not get something small and put on a TV show, or a YouTube video? Being broke is a little irrelevant for this, because if just getting out and enjoying some time makes you happy, it was a $15-$20 well spent! I do this now; I go to a mall alone and I will find somewhere to get a drink or eat alone, almost in a way to conquer the fears. \n\nYou should take a step back and think about the life you want to live, and think about some ways you can confront and overcome the pain and loneliness you feel inside", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1768025671.0, "id": "nyqs2rj", "author": "Riaxuez"}

I trusted him.\nThe next day, I took 1,600 pounds from my mom. I had never taken that kind of money in my life. Not for clothes. Not for food. Not for anything.\n\nMy diet became extremely expensive. Half a kilo of chicken breast every day. Eggs. Milk. Bland food I cooked myself. I forced myself to eat even when my body refused. I reached a point where after meals I would cut my arm with a razor out of depression and frustration. I wasn’t trying to die. I just didn’t know how to handle the pressure anymore.\n\nThen the coach told me I needed supplements for 3,000 pounds. That number was huge for me. I sold my phone to get them.\nThat phone was the first phone I ever owned in my life. My mom had just bought it for me. It was my only entertainment, my escape. I sold it without hesitation because I didn’t want to lose the dream he kept feeding me.\n\nThe supplements didn’t even last a month and a half.\nTwo months passed, and then he told me the competition was postponed for another three months.\n\nI had already spent more money than I ever imagined having. I was mentally destroyed but I kept going. I paid again. More coaching fees. More food. I was embarrassed in front of my family. They had to buy expensive food for the whole house so I wouldn’t feel alone eating differently.\n\nI quit smoking just to save money. Every pound in my life went to the gym or food. I couldn’t even afford a 5-pound box of cornflakes that was part of my diet. I had to beg my parents and siblings for money. Daily fights. No one believed in me anymore. Everyone thought I was wasting my life.\n\nFinally, the competition got close. All those months of bulking were over. Then came cutting.\nThe diet became even more expensive and the hunger was unbearable. My stomach hurt constantly. I couldn’t sleep. I woke up starving. Every morning I went to the gym fasted and walked on the treadmill for 30 minutes with no food. At night, I trained again.\n\nAll of this while I had just started my senior year of high school.\nI was exhausted, starving, mentally broken, but I kept telling myself it would be worth it when I stepped on that stage.\n\nTwo days before the competition, after the hardest weeks of my life, the coach told me something I will never forget.\nHe said I needed to pay 3,000 pounds as an entry fee to actually compete.\n\nNo one ever told me that before.\nI had zero money. Literally nothing.\n\nAt the same time, my sister was in intensive care with lupus. There wasn’t a single pound in our house.\nThere was no other competition. This was my only chance.\n\nI didn’t enter.\n\nI stood there realizing that after months of pain, hunger, selling my phone, hurting myself, disappointing my family, and destroying my mental health… everything ended because of 3,000 pounds I didn’t have.\n\nI didn’t feel angry.\nI felt empty.\nShocked.\nLike I had been chasing something that kept moving further away every time I got close.\n\nI didn’t lose a competition.\nI lost trust.\nI lost a part of myself that believed hard work is always enough.\n\nI just needed to get this off my chest.", "score": 26, "num_comments": 14, "created_utc": 1768023422.0, "id": "1q8vwdr", "author": "Unlikely-Rough8075", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8vwdr/sacrificed_my_mental_health_for_a_dream_that/"}

She likes the way it feels, because Meth gives you euphoria.  The opioids dull/remove the pain, stifle anxiety.  If you can get her to admit that’s why she’s using drugs, there are programs that can help her.  That being said, it’s almost impossible for someone using drugs to emotionally escape to process and analyze why they’re doing it. \nIn the end, after making that effort - you must detach. You’ll grow to hate your friend. She’ll steal from you, lie to you, use you and betray you. All to get that drugged feeling. \nAny way you go, there’s going to be tears and pain.  I’d definitely get adult help. \nAt 17, there should be a counselor at school.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I'm a mess. I've tried everything. What do I do now?", "text": "I try to think of myself as a very self-aware person. I used to constantly break my back to please people when I was younger. My mind was constantly filled with memories of old embarrassing conversations and if I said or did the right thing to people and at the end of the day, I knew there was barely any of \\*me\\* left. I didn't really know who exactly I was but I did know that I was a bit weird. Throughout all the schools i went to, I was constantly excluded and bullied. Then in 7th grade, my dad died. From then on, I became more into myself and I started adopting a mindset of \"f them if they don't like me\" and \"I don't need anyone to do anything; do everything for you by yourself.\" Whenever I remembered an old conversation that would've made me embarrassed, it made me feel angry instead (Almost like in a defensive way)I stopped playing my sport, defected from my churches, and stopped drawing because I recognized that I didn't really want to engage in those things, my mom wanted me to do them and people around me wanted it for me more than I ever did.\n\nSeeing me \"lose\" interest in things I \"liked to do before\", my mom thought I was unhappy and depressed. I couldn't understand why she couldn't see this is \\*me\\*. While I started this journey to find myself, I don't think the real me is whats best for me. I lie uncontrollably and I wronged people left and right. I recognized this as I matured and corrected my behaviors and took accountability for my actions. I was getting better. I found I really like piano and a genre called BL and I became more confident in myself. But something plagues me.\n\nIt's like this noise in my head that won't quiet. At first, I could eat food and it would go silent but now it doesn't quiet even when I eat. My body feels good but my mind doesn't. Then routinely cutting myself everyday + whenever I was experiencing emotions I didn't want to face made it stop for a short while but then the noise persevered even while I was bleeding on the cold tile floors. All while I struggled more and more to go to sleep and stay asleep as night. It feels like this insomnia is consuming me as this static festers, getting louder and louder. And when I do manage to fall asleep, I'm plagued by vivid and horrifically violent dreams where this noise/voice is amplified. I've described these nightmares to dream interpreters and a lot of them said I could be on the verge of experiencing an \"ego death\".\n\nThere's something brewing in me that I just don't know which confuses me because I've always thought myself to be very self aware. And without answers, I could only focus on quieting my mind. I became addicted to scrolling and pornography. I would go back and forth between tiktok, instagram, and twitter. The doom scrolling would make me feel like shit once again while it did numb me. I hated the way it made me feel and I totally ruined the tenderness of pleasure--it kills my mood--so I moved on to listening to music...all the time. And then reading...all the time.\n\nNow that I read with my blasting headphones pretty much all the time, I don't have time for other people. This year, my spotify wrapped said I listened to about 177,000 minutes (around 121 days) and I hit 300 read books a month or two again. I've just gone through so many addictions, I'm worried this behavior will repeat with something even more harmful in the future.\n\nI made this post because slowly, the music I blast hasn't been enough and I'm finding less and less books that are engaging enough for my particular taste. I've become a bit of a recluse. I just sit around reading and listening to music and organizing my computer layout while I sink deeper and deeper. I hate the light- any light whether its my computer light, room light, or the sun light. I feel the best in the dark now.\n\nI went through all this addictions and I've got nothing to show for it. I never solved or even figured out my problem. Ironically, I think by trying to find myself, I made things worse and now I'm a mess. I'm just so tired of laying in my bed every night with this emptiness and disquiet.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "Its wild to see each of these getting checked \n\n10 tactics of fascism by Jason Stanley \n\nThe mythic past. Fascists promote a glorified mythical past to make people dissatisfied with the present. The past is painted as a time of greatness. That greatness was based on a strong military and the fact that the dominant racial group ruled over the others. Fascists claim that the “leftists and communists” have “taken your greatness from you.”\n\nPropaganda. Fascists lie and manipulate language in order to rewrite the shared reality of the population. Fascist propaganda is based around naming “friends” and “enemies.” The political opponent is declared to be a merciless threat to the nation.\nAnti-intellectualism. Fascists attack universities and educational systems because they could potentially teach people to challenge fascist ideas. The fascist leader sets the rules about what is true or false. Expertise, even reality, is a threat to the authority of the leader.\n\nUnreality. Freedom and political equality require truth. Fascist voices work deliberately to create a state of unreality. Its adherents lose the ability to recognize truth. Reasoned discussion and debate is replaced with conspiracy theories and lies.\n\nHierarchy. Fascists create a hierarchy of human worth. They promote social divisions and harden social rankings over such things as race, religion, and gender. Once the hierarchies are in place, people are controlled by being kept nervous and frightened about the possibility of losing their place in the hierarchy.\n\nVictim-hood. Once people come to believe that they are higher than another group in the hierarchy, any move toward equality by lower groups is used to stoke feelings of resentment and victim-hood among the dominant population. Equality becomes, not a goal, but a threat.\n\nLaw and Order. “Law and Order” politics is used to cast “them” as dangerous, lawless, criminals and to justify brutal crackdowns on minorities or people who are out of favor. Minority groups are considered “law-abiding” only as long as they accept their subservient role. At the same time, however, the fascist leader is not bound by any law.\n\nSexual Anxiety. A fascist hierarchy is rigidly patriarchal and is threatened by gender equity. Hence, they impose strict control and dominance over women. They also promote paranoia about homosexuality.\n\nSodom and Gomorrah. Fascist movements typically emphasize an urban/rural divide. The cities are portrayed as decadent criminal centers full of enemy “elites” and immigrants. City dwellers don’t even do “real” work (with their hands) like rural folks do.\n\nArbeit macht frei. (Work shall make you free). This slogan was written on the gates of Auschwitz. Fascists claim that the minority group and the leftists are lazy by nature and must be made to work (hence, concentration camps and forced labor camps). Labor unions are said to be run by communists – so unions must be crushed. Since hard work (by the underclasses) is the primary virtue, fascists ultimately decide that the disabled have no value and devise ways to get rid of them.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768044058.0, "id": "nyrq1mb", "author": "larryjeuness"}

When I looked back up at her she was getting really close and then she just started kissing me. I didn't know what to do so I just froze and let her continue. She kept kissing me and kissing my neck and started fondling me. She used her fingers to (very quickly) bring me to climax and then I stood up-mentally told myself that I had finished so quickly simply because I wanted it to be over... my grandmother had just SA'd me.

It devolved more and more to them attempting to evict me by calling the lease manager and the fucking police.\n\nanother friend that was supposed to replace something they had broken from me, stopped talking to me altogether because of these rumors. \n\nthe loss of control over me sent them into madness. i have never heard her best friend scream so loud through the door.\n\nconstant harassment, judgement, bullying, banging on the door,  etc. \n\nthe weirdest part is that i noticed throughout all of the insults they threw at me, they were projecting. giving me this dreadful feeling and a wave of sadness. \n\nthey would listen to me through the walls (i think they still do), go through my room when i was gone, touch my stuff, somehow got into my car and smoked, messed with my car right side mirror, threw a milkshake at my car, spit on the driver window, and much more.\n\nfor 2 more weeks it continued non stop.\n\neventually dying out when they couldnt shake me. from the start until now, i have locked my door every time i come home, i never say a word to them, and i focus on myself until i can get out of here. they seemed to HATE that. so i guess they eventually realized they were fighting themselves.\n\nevery other week they would basically ask me to leave and break my part of the lease, up until now. Now the lease is being broken altogether.\n\n  \nMy Thoughts:   \nthe entire thing was a recipe for disaster. i should have known that her best friend would be exactly like she is. her best friend has a girlfriend too, and that girl has no idea what she does behind her back.  \n  \nThis happened months ago, I tried to get the police involved with them tampering with my mail and touching my car, but they told me to focus on myself.   \n  \nthe emotions I went through were so unstable that I cant really remember much, but immediately after breaking up with her, my chest pain never came back so i knew i did something right after all. \n\nfrom there ive been moving upwards, better personality (I CAN TALK TO RANDOM GIRLS!!!), funnier jokes, etc.\n\nalso fun fact, i think because i was in survival mode for so long my reflexes and reaction time have increased like crazy, and the confirmation of my concerns proved im not a dumb person. I figured them all out, and now i understand who they are. Theyre apparently afraid of me even though i havent done a thing, if that says anything. \n\nThanks for reading, stay safe because demons are real, they're just very pretty.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768015737.0, "id": "1q8tcef", "author": "Mission-Enthusiasm73", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8tcef/living_with_my_ex_girlfriend_and_her_bestfriend/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "If my spiritual path of Vedanta has taught me anything, it's that there is a quiet and undisturbed peace inside you always. Suffering is merely a forgetting of your own nature, which is peace and happiness itself. Your happiness is not contingent on anything happening out there. The world could be crumbling around you, and you could still be happy. That sounds crazy until you come to fully realize that this is absolutely true. \n\nYes, it is easy to fall into the trap of suffering. It is part of our experience, but it is a necessary part nonetheless. \n\nI like to use the mental image of a painting. A painting is beautiful precisely because of its colors and shades. A purely white painting is simply a canvas. A purely black painting is a canvas. You cannot know pleasure *or* suffering without reference to its duality, to its opposite. \n\nBut enlightenment is the understanding that all dualities must collapse into unity in the presence of Brahman (God, or simply Awareness. It's you, but the real you, beneath the superficial layers of ego and identity. That is God.) Suffering is not something to be avoided, it's something to be embraced and integrated. Pleasure, suffering, it's all just *Experience*. The illumined eye sees no difference, and he is peaceful. \n\nUnderstanding all of this doesn't make things not hurt. It means you stop giving suffering unnecessary attention. Our thoughts are like amplifiers, and greatly affect the degree to which we suffer. Exercise control over your thoughts and emotions, and you will find that the grip of suffering on the mind loosens dramatically.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768018710.0, "id": "nyqbpe5", "author": "naeramarth2"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I think childhood trauma made me asexual and I hate it.", "text": "When I was little, my mother had been very addicted to a certain mmorpg. I'd always watch her play it (I was like 4-5 years old), and when I was 6, I finally got to make my own account and also became very addicted.\n\nShe pretended to be a lot younger than she actually was and would date men on there. Instead of me being her daughter, I was now suddenly her little sister. My mom would even \"marry\" some of the guys on there, despite actually being married for a full decade in real life. We would quest and play with these random boys, and there were always several of them, but they were always kept a secret from each other. Sometimes she would purposefully (and accidentally) expose/introduce them to each other so that they would fight over her. I think at some point she had at least 4 different boyfriends at once.\n\nThis might come off of a rant, but I really just want to talk about it.\n\nAll of the boys were, of course, extremely sexual towards my mom, some more than others. While she and I and some guy were questing, I'd be able to hear her typing and laughing in the living room on her laptop, flirting with them and such. I hated it so much. She always kept it a secret from my dad, too.\n\nThere were a ton of different guys she dated, but there was one that REALLY stuck around for a long time. I'll call him \"T.\" T was a total loser and had nothing going on for him and whatnot, and was OBSESSED with my mom. She'd stay up super late just to talk to him and play with him since he lived in a different timezone, but he'd also wake up and play early for her... so they really just wanted to spend all day together. T was my least favorite out of all the boyfriends because before meeting him, she had finally gotten rid of all of the other guys. I just remember being in her in-game house with him and they talked about being in a relationship and I kept crying and begging her to forget about him. I remember crying \"not again!\" and her telling me to stop crying before my dad got home so he wouldn't ask me what was wrong.\n\nShe stopped cooking as much, she'd rush to get me to school, all that jazz. I felt like I had to fight for her attention. If I asked for help with something, she'd say \"hold on\" and make me wait half an hour before I had to re-ask her or she'd finally help me. She'd even take her laptop with her into the bathroom and sit there for an hour before finally getting off.\n\nI never felt like I was her priority, and at some point, I tried doing something about it. On one of my birthdays, things were going as usual. I forgot why, but T had wanted to log onto my account, and my mother let him despite my protests. I can't remember if this was THE first time he ever logged on because he had been logging on randomly at some point in time, but whatever. \n\nBefore he logged on, I had made sure to delete one of two of my super rare weapons because I wanted to pin the blame on him. Of course he claimed he didn't do it, because he didn't, but the thing that really bothered me was that she believed him over me. Yes, he didn't do it, but she still trusted some random lustful asshole online instead of her own daughter. I think I was probably 8 or 9 at the time, I can't remember. She always said it was \"Just for fun,\" but sometimes I think she genuinely loved this guy even though he just talked about his genitals 24/7. I also know she probably just liked all the attention she got from him and the others.\n\nThis T guy in particular was very troublesome because they ALWAYS got into fights. She'd pick me up from school, and the moment I got in the car, she'd tell me about how I'd have to go home and get online ASAP so that I could \"talk to T\" for her.  And by \"talk to T\" she meant that she talks through me, basically. I had to type whatever she wanted to T to settle their argument. This sometimes took hours. This was damn near everyday and I hated it. I hated HIM. I hated ALL OF THEM.  He was overbearingly sexual towards her and he'd do it right in front of me because he thought my reactions were hilarious. Remember, I was her little sister, not her daughter, so I was just mad that my older sister wasn't paying attention to me. It sounds a lot dumber when you replace it with \"sister\" instead of \"mom.\" I'd get super pissed and start crying and yelling at him through the screen, and I guess he just loved every second of it. And she \"married\" this guy in the game... twice, I think, since they always got into fights.\n\nI'm 19 years old now. Ever since I was around 16, I was like \"huh... y'know, I'm pretty mature now. Some of my friends are starting to have sex.\" and yada yada. I realized that I just never ever got horny. I still never have. I've never felt a desire to be physically close to someone, I've never \"lusted\" after someone. I brought this up to my dad (to which he then redirected me to my mom lol) and she was like \"ehh don't worry, you just haven't met the right guy yet,\" but I don't think that's the case. I don't even like kissing! And kissing is hyped up in every disney teen movie-- it's GOTTA be something miraculous, right?\n\nKind of a side note, but in high school, I had a crush on this one guy for 3 years. He asked me to be his girlfriend and I instantly accepted, but the day after I accepted, I instantly lost all interest in him. I guess this is considered me \"liking the chase\" instead of the end result, but I just thought it was worth a mention. I broke up with him after a day and we had tried being together again, but I ended it AGAIN because I lost feelings instantly, and broke up with him just a few weeks later. Do you think this is correlated?\n\nSomething that makes me believe this may be part of my childhood is because I HATE seeing my parents express love towards each other. Sometimes my mom will sit on my dad's lap (not in the sexual position) and it just pisses me off for some reason. I hate seeing them kiss, sometimes I hate seeing them hold hands. I hate when they do a long, intimate hug. I can't even explain why.\n\nI hate being asexual. I feel like if someone ever got into a relationship with me, they'd just be settling. Why would you wanna be with someone, even if they're great, if they don't wanna have sex? I've heard people online say that a partner without sex is just a friend... do the masses really feel that way? I hope not. I'd also go batshit insane if I ever found out my partner watched porn or anything like that because I'd be... jealous, I guess? I dunno, but the thought of it pisses me off. \n\nI think naked bodies are so disgusting, even if they're muscular and lean and good looking. I cannot bear to look at genitals, they're just so gross. I can only get turned on through reading, but even that arousal lasts like... 10 seconds (also, probably TMI but I feel it's worth mentioning that I have 0 sensitivity down there. Is that normal amongst asexuals?) I don't think I could participate in sex with a trusted partner even if I wanted to, because I just don't feel that my body would respond appropriately. \n\n I have a strong hatred for men that objectify women, and because of that, I want a very specific type of partner because I feel like I would just despise being with him otherwise. A part of me wants to be desired and sexualized, but it has to be with the right person. I guess that part is normal, though. I'd imagine that this extreme hatred comes from my mom. \n\nAnyway... What are the odds this is all because of my childhood? I WANT to connect physically with someone, but I just can't because it's so gross to me. I've never been in a situation where I am actually given the opportunity to be intimate with someone I do trust, so I don't know how I'd react. However, I do know that I cringe and have to look away when I accidentally see naked people online. I hate porn, it's so gross.\n\nI feel half human. I often try to compare it to hunger because a lot of people do not understand asexuality; Imagine you never feel hunger and therefore do not want to eat. You see advertisements for food EVERYWHERE, it's ALWAYS on TV. You see and hear about people eating every single day. People that you like being around invite you to go out to eat, but you have to decline. You're simply not hungry. You suppose that you technically... COULD eat, but do you really want to? Not really. But now everyone thinks you're weird. They've never seen you eating with anyone! Who the hell does that? You're in college, you should be enjoying all the amazing food out there! Looots of people would wanna eat with you, you know! But if you eat, you think you'll throw up. Does that make sense?\n\nI don't know how to end this post but thanks for reading if you did ;-;", "score": 10, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": 1768012377.0, "id": "1q8s4zv", "author": "Background_Froyo3653", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8s4zv/i_think_childhood_trauma_made_me_asexual_and_i/"}

I don’t pretend that I, an American, can go save other people when we cannot even save ourselves. I also remember 9/11, the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war, and how incredibly stupid it was, but it’s not surprising that given Netanyahu has more control of our government than most citizens and he’s the same man who intentionally destabilized Syria AND has his terrorist group (the merger of three separate terrorist groups within Palestine, the Lehi, the Irgun and the Haganah, now called the IDF- Israeli death fighters) is still occupying Southern Lebanon. I can only offer platitudes, but that’s better than ignoring the suffering of another. Maybe stop assuming what Americans think and feel by the inaccurate news you’ve probably been told to hate the American people for what the government does. The American people have not had control of their own government for decades. I don’t remember a single time, the government gave a fuck about what Americans think and feel. They are servants to oligarchs like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg, who can rig elections and bribe politicians legally, because they are rich and corporations are people too, but somehow don’t have the same limits as humans have.

I was about 5, and she was 2 or 3. We were tugging at a big beanie baby bear and I pulled her too hard. She smashed her face on the corner of our wooden toy box. It was heartbreaking to see her get hurt. she went to the hospital and ended up going under anesthesia to have her damaged front teeth pulled out. Unfortunately, her baby teeth affected her adult teeth, so when they grew in, they were crooked and didn’t come down properly. \n\nIt really hurt me to see her struggle with her smile. It was a huge insecurity for her and it was my fault. She always did closed mouth smiles. To me she was always perfect. I knew that she knew she was beautiful too but I can see how much her smile weighed on her self esteem. I genuinely felt it was holding her back from pursuing her dream of modeling as well. \n\nI felt so guilty for years and always wondered if her life wouldve been better/different if i wasn't such a stupid kid that day and just let her have the damn bear. Of course after that i let her keep the bear and never argued over toys or belongings again.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "I went through something extremely similar myself about 6 months ago. My wife, that I had been with for almost 15 years, chose to chase a relationship with another man over our marriage, kid and the life we had worked so hard to build. While this was ongoing, I spiraled mentally and crashed out kinda hard; said and did some things I wish I hadn’t, and verbally drug her and her friends who were around the affair through the mud. So naturally, my reaction is what really caused the breakup and divorce if you ask her. \n\nI digress…\n\nPoint is, I was in a very dark hole for a couple of months that I didn’t think I could crawl of, but guess what? I did very quickly. And do you want to know how? Therapy, and talking to my doctor and getting on medication to help with my sleep and general depression (something I was dealing with even before the divorce). \n\nAlso, try journaling for a while to get your feelings out, and if you’re into woowoo shit like me, do a ritual where you release yourself from the relationship (I penned a long letter to her, then took it to a place that was once special to us, burned it, and said goodbye. Something about it was very freeing). \n\nAlso, if you can, take some time off of work and go on a solo trip somewhere. I took 10 days and went to Bogota and had an amazing time. I think taking time to travel and forcing yourself to get out gives a perspective shift; you realize your ex wife relationship drama isn’t that important unless you make it that way. There’s so much else out there and life’s actually really rad. \n\nAs for me, I’m dating and enjoying life again, and the biggest perk is that I’ve stopped taking anyone or anything too seriously. Life’s too short to be stuck on someone who didn’t choose you. Now you get to choose you. You are free my friend. \n\nP.S.\nFirst things first; Stop replaying those old memories. Delete the pictures. Block her socials. Detach emotionally.

English is my third language so forgive any language related transgressions.\n\nI'm tired of people, I'm tired of everything going on in this world.\n\nI live in a first world country in Europe, having been adopted from South East Asia when I was 3 months old. As far as I remember, childhood was bliss. Loving (helicopter) parents, good friends... When I was 4 I was diagnosed with giftedness (performance IQ 115, verbal IQ 140), and my parents did whatever they could to help, or so they thought. They made me skip a grade, which made me the runt of the class (being born in december) but I don't blame them for anything, they did the best they could. \n\n  \nHigh school was hell, I did not fit in due to being a hardcore introvert and the bullying did not help. Did not have many friends, much less real friends, maybe one. As the cliché goes I stopped performing well at school to be a bit more edgy or whatever it would take so not everybody would see me as an outcast. At 15 y.o I had my first girlfriend, which only happened because the girl had a crush on me because I was Asian I suppose. I won't bother with the details because that was 17 years ago so my memory doesn't serve me well, but the gist of it was I said yes to being her boyfriend because I didn't want to be alone. I do not understand the concept of love, I never did, only the need not to be alone. So I endured some verbal abuse and emotional suffering (she wanted to harm herself for various reasons etc).\n\nFast forward 2 years, I met another girl while still in a relationship with the previous and being the juvenile asshole that I was I started a relationship with her too, while letting the first one fade out, she was very sweet but once again I only felt affection, not really love. One year later I did the same when I met another girl who for some reason really liked me. Same story, we were together for 2 years even. She ended the relationship when abroad on vacation but I didn't really feel sad, I had already 'moved on' and set my sights on somebody else. \n\nShe was not pretty by conventional standards, but for some reason I was madly attracted to her so for the first time ever I actually chased someone. Perserverance payed off, or so I thought. 6 months later she broke up with me (20 y.o at the time) and for the first time I felt this enormous non-physical pain like a gaping hole. I was confused. Did i experience heartbreak or was I just raging for losing control. At that time I was also studying in college for Public Administration but I left disillusioned because no matter how I tried to make it work, government was never an anwser. I did however thourougly enjoy talking about politics and the necessity of public servants. During my studies I worked as a waiter at events to help me overcome me being socially incapable, while also enjoying the work. \n\n  \nAt 22 I met my 'biggest relationship' which spanned 8 years. We were doomed from the start. I became her favorite person (in terms of bipolarity) and me being me just went along for the ride. I wasn't happy, but at least I had something going I think...\n\nWe quickly became codependent on each other, which was further enforced by the COVID lockdowns. I was still figuring out what I wanted from life, but it was easier to let her decide the stuff that mattered. She had her flaws, linked to her bipolarity but I was considering the (dis)advantages of staying together. Since the lockdowns made everyones lives grind to a halt we were stuck in limbo at 25-26y.o and when those lockdowns ended she wanted to make up for lost time (child and marriage asap). We moved from my appartment to a row house in the suburbs she bought but the house needed many renovations. From the start when we had fights she would become this emotional supernova while I tried to disengage and retreat while at that time she wouldnt let me physically leave. It started with me - being non confrontational- just letting her scream, evolving to pushing her away (hard) and spilling coffee on the wooden floor (because it was her house), thinking if I can't leave I might as well do some damage. \n\nAfter 1 grueling year of working (still in hospitality) and renovating we had talks about having a kid, I bought some time with good arguments but I knew I couldn't keep postponing. After 2 months she was already pregnant and 9 months later we had a beautiful son. This time I was very sure I did not love her. I can feel anger, sadness, empathy and joy, etc... But I never (except maybe for the short relationship with that one girl I chased) felt love, or how people say it's supposed to feel. I just felt as time went by I had to hide more of myself. She also didn't approve of my best friend (he was a bad influence according to her, I didn't disagree but I needed an escape from time to time) so we made the deal I would see him once a month. \n\nTrying to make things better we went to a trip to Rome. -sidenote; we promised each other to always be available by phone if needed- on the second day we visited the Colosseum while I was handling the stroller (which had her phone in it too). I had to go up with the elevator and join the group but as we reached the end we had to go downstairs (no elevator, unless I went back). For some reason she followed the group while I was struggling with the stroller, I tried to race back to the elevator but I had lost everyone and I couldn't reach her. There I stood alone with my infant son and girlfriend nowhere to be seen. After one hour of searching I finally found her (we had an earpiece from the guide and I was moving towards the sound) but I was pissed beyond reason and told her I wanted to go back to the hotel. She convinced me to stay on the tour and when that was done we went to a shitty restaurant and a wine bar after. I drank heavilly. At 135lbs I drank +2 bottles of red wine because I tried to cope with the fact I was left alone in a city I didn't know. When I helped my son walk barefoot on the streets (still learning how to walk then) she berated my for doing so. \n\nI lost it. I struck her in the face and ran away. I walked back to the hotel and \"reconciled\" meeting her there but something had broken. When we got back from our travels I tried to be better, I even bought an engagement ring and proposed. We (she) planned for a small wedding, and I thought that would be the end of our troubles. I met up with my best friend later and drank a lot, again. When I came home I got berated for the state I was in, I lost it again. I worked 4 days a week from 10AM till 00AM with little or zero breaks to make ends meet for us and she knew I needed an escape now and then. My 5th 'work day' was taking care of our son and she insisted I also woke up with her at 7AM on the weekends. \n\nI took a bottle of some scotch and drank it up. She went on going crazy. I hit her again. I couldn't keep the noise out. We broke up and quickly made an arrangement for custody. \n\nI felt guilty for my actions, she knew I felt sorry and it became obvious she started using my guilt for her own personal gain. Spent a shitload of money on psychologists but it didn't help, or at least that's my experience. The few friends I had left that knew us both weren't surprised what happened. \n\nI was alone for the first time since I was 15. Happier, but alone. We made an arrangement with rules for custody and child support and whenever I didn't have my son I went working so I could buy my own house (moved back with my mom for 6 months).\n\nFrom the start I have been met by malicious compliance by her and other stuff like berating me when I was 2-5 minutes late while she herself was regulary late for +15mins or so. I let it slide out of guilt. But it kept happening. She also didn't want to say anything much about our son so I had to figure it out by myself while he couldn't really talk/ communicate. \n\nShe doesn't uphold our agreement and I expressed my dissatisfaction in a polite manner, but it doens't matter. She keeps ignoring being on time or communicating and I am, as a result, comtemplating to hurt her back. \n\nMy mind feels clouded. I want to hurt her so bad but I don't want my son to lose his mother. I don't have much family left as opposed to her, and my intrusive thoughts are getting the better hand of me the last weeks. I want to hurt her family (who never approved of me anyways so I'm not holding thought back there), even going as far as giving up my life and just go around and kill them all. \n\nI have no real justification for this, and I'm aware of that. But I feel like I'm losing grip, and just like the day we broke up and I was drunk out of my mind thinking 'fuck you I'm tired of this shit', now I'm having the same thoughts sober.\n\nI have been faking love all my life, and at this point I feel to broken to even begin healing. My mind is blurred and the only options I see is by sharing and multiplying the suffering by going on a killing spree or just ending it for myself.\n\nI'm sorry for this incoherent crazy post, throwaway for obvious reasons and I also won't come back to check on it. Just wanted to share how I feel for once in my lifetime.

He had an 8-year relationship before me, and his ex cheated on him. While we were dating during the early months, I noticed he was still talking to his ex on Viber. During a short trip for his birthday, I ended up reading their conversation. I asked him to stop because it made me feel disrespected. He eventually blocked her.\nYears passed, and I tried to move on from that. Then he transferred to a new company. I caught him deleting Instagram conversations. He was flirting with a girl from his new office. I stayed quiet for weeks, collected evidence, and finally confronted him. The confrontation left me feeling gaslighted. Somehow, I still tried to trust him again.\n\nNow here we are. I feel like he’s talking to someone else again. I don’t have proof this time, just the same familiar feeling. He sometimes jokes that one day I’ll find someone else. We also have a 14-year age gap, which makes everything feel heavier in my head.\n\nI’m not asking for advice or validation.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I’m (F26) frustrated with my boyfriends (M27) avoidant behavior, while I’ve been dealing with a long term family emergency", "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI just have to get this off my chest.\n\nBasically, me and my bf have been dating for a little over a year now. Around 4 or so months ago, both of my dad’s retinas detached. Since then, I’ve been my dad’s primary care taker, taking him to doctors appointments, several extremely traumatic surgeries, grocery shopping, cleaning the house, etc.\n\nIn the past month, I had to start working part time because my dad was having doctors appointments every other day. Oftentimes, we’d be there anywhere from 3-6 hours.\n\nAs you can imagine, this has been extremely hard on me and my dad. Because my friends and my bf live an hour away, I’ve spent a lot of time either at work, the doctors, or isolation. I definitely am in a situation where I need emotional support.\n\nFor a while I’d call my boyfriend every other day or so, and we’d talk from anywhere from 5min-30min. However, around a month ago, during the stress of the holiday season and my dads health being the worst it’s ever been, he told me point blank that he does not enjoy talking on the phone with me and would rather talk in person.\n\nThis really hurt me. It also hurt me that he had never called me to ask me about my dad, or plans dates half way between us. I always have to bring up my dad and then feel like a burden when I do, because it is, of course, a major bummer.\n\nWhen I do talk about what’s going, all he does is say “that sucks.” I really wish he was open to having deeper, more exploratory conversations because this is most definitely a life changing experience for both me and my father.\n\nI brought up the phone call thing, and he did apologize for it. However, he keeps acting avoidant. He doesn’t plan dates, or to meet me somewhere in the middle, and he still never asks about my dad.\n\nRecently, I had time to meet some friends at a bar for trivia after work. Because my boyfriend is unemployed and not taking any classes rn, I thought he could meet me there 1.5-2 hours early so we can talk before our friends get there.\n\nIn my head, this was like a little date, because we haven’t seen each other in a while. Unfortunately, he negotiated to get there an hour before our friends got there, so I had to wait.\n\nWhen he got there, he seemed fairly depressed, quiet, disinterested, and stoned. I was obviously upset by this, but tried to keep the tone light and airy for when our friends came. Afterwards, I pulled him aside and asked if he was feeling ok.\n\nLong story short, I told him that I felt hurt that his body language looked so depressed because I hadn’t seen him in a while. He got very defensive, said that I talk to much, that I’m paranoid, that I never let him speak, and that it’s not that big of a deal if he comes to meet me sleepy and stoned.\n\nI do talk a lot, but part of it is because he talks so little. If I don’t ask him a question, he usually won’t say much at all, if anything. So sometimes I do feel a little ADHD around him, bc I’m trying to find something that “sticks.”\n\nIn conclusion, I really want him to open up more so we can feel closer. We have a good baseline level of attraction and warmth with each other that I really really want to advance and cultivate. But everytime I try to bring up a deep, or difficult conversation or an inconvenient emotion (like talking about my dad) he just completely shuts off. He doesn’t want to explore it, he gets defensive, and he’s sooo private.\n\nI’m frustrated bc I’m at my ropes end trying to take care of my dad, and I just wish my boyfriend would realize that by being insensitive, he’s really making me feel way worse than I’d like to rn.\n\nAt the very least, I just wish that he’d genuinely acknowledge, in a deep and meaningful way, that I am doing so fucking much rn, and all I want is for my bf to act like he enjoys talking to me.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for how I can try to explain this to him in a way where he won’t get super defensive?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768010821.0, "id": "1q8rkan", "author": "azaleaflow", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8rkan/im_f26_frustrated_with_my_boyfriends_m27_avoidant/"}

I dont think its an excuse for him to be unsupportvie just assuming the reasoning for his pulling away. \n\nI do think though that you probably have to tell him that you feel alone and that you would very much like his support and itd be an added bonus if you can mention you have a lot on your mind with your dads current situation and you feel as though you cant share those thoughts because it feels like he is not engaging. \n\nSomething practical could be on calls setting a time where you can both speak of heavy things before moving to less stressful things. Its not ideal to say okay after this time dont speak of your worries but i think sometimes when it just feels like a relationship is heavy guys can tend to want to take a step back because even though you dont excpect him to fix your issues as a boyfriend i imsgine as a girlfriend to it feels shitty to not be able to comfort a partner. (Not saying that its right to withdraw or center yourself, just trying to give an explanation as to why he could be acting in this manner)\n\n  \nI know that you are dealing with a lot right now so expressing that the current state of the relationship where you feel unsupported makes you question the future isnt probably what you wish to express but i think you should tell him. \n\nOnce he knows how you truly feel he can either try and be there for you or he might not be a good partner to you in this moment. \n\n  \nAlso if he says he has his own things going on (which seems very male coded) you might have to decide if you are currently okay with having a partner who pulls away in such times and i think you need to express that to him.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768012585.0, "id": "nypulii", "author": "pleasecallmenancy"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Was I a rebound? I can’t stop thinking about his ex", "text": "Mid 2025 I met this guy at work and we hit it off. I felt this connection and pull to him I almost never feel with anyone, and interest and curiosity to find out more about him drew me in. He was quiet and reserved and I could tell he wanted to talk to me too.\n\nWe slowly started talking and speaking to him was the highlight of my day. Not to seem too eager (especially because I’m shy), I made sure to limit our interactions so I didn’t come across too excited. As the weeks flew by our connection grew stronger. We would go out after work together at least once a week for hours, sometimes until early morning. He introduced me to one of his close friends and we would go out on late night adventures, or the movies, or some sort of fun activity.\n\nEventually I confessed to liking him and he told me he felt the same. From then the hangouts were just us two without extra company and they became dates. After a few more weeks we made it official.\n\nBeing with him felt like a drug. There was never a dull moment. Even when we weren’t doing anything or just walking side by side I was so content. Although he wasn’t the type (physically or personality wise) I had imagined for myself in the past, I found that I liked him and accepted him as a whole.\n\nI loved him with my whole being and since it was my first relationship I wanted to give it my all and treat him the best I could. I remember one of the first times we kissed it was freezing and raining and we were waiting for our dinner booking, so we stood under shelter and hugged to keep warm. I pulled back and kissed him and I looked him in the eyes and said, “Promise me you’ll never hurt me. Please stay kind to me.” He looked shocked/uncomfortable but said “of course.” I meant it so genuinely. He was my first everything.\n\nBut when it became official something shifted. It felt like he approached me with lust. The emotional connection was not being built and it felt like it was only escalating physically. I told him we needed to slow down and that I was still curious about him and wanted to know him and feel connected to him more. It felt like there was a wall between us and there was only so close I could get to him.\n\nI was wary of overwhelming him so I never pressed or asked him too much when he would tell me he was going through things. I assumed if he truly wanted to tell me, he eventually would.\n\nHe slowly distanced himself and I constantly questioned and wondered what I was doing wrong. I wanted to fix any problems we had because I had so much hope and desire for our relationship to flourish. I voiced that I felt this wall between us and he took it as “I’m not enough” or “I’m not good.” He felt uncomfortable and needed space.\n\nWe took a break from the relationship to work through our 'issues' and decided to try again in a month.\n\nDuring that month it seemed like he was itching to constantly talk to me and I had to remind him that this was time to focus on ourselves. The month passed and on the day we were meant to be together again, he switched again and was even more distant. Then a week later he dumped me over text. No reason. He didn’t want to talk it out.\n\n(And later I found out through someone else that he’d apparently said he 'doesn’t want to date someone in the workplace' and that he 'doesn’t want to see me every day.' when they asked what happened between me and him (bc we used to always get lunch and take our breaks together) Which hurt so badly because it landed like I wasn’t special enough.)\n\nThe worst part is we work together, and nobody at work knows we even dated. I’ve kept my dignity and I never spoke or interacted with him when I see him at work after he dumped me. No words have been exchanged and it’s been over 100 days.\n\nThere hasn’t been a day that I have not thought about him. I think about him when I wake up and when I fall asleep. I miss him so much and it hurts me so much that he just threw everything away like I did not matter. He meant so much to me. I felt comfortable and at home when I was with him.\n\nA couple months after we 'broke up' I found out (through rumours from another colleague) that he had a girlfriend from when we first met. Apparently a few weeks into meeting me he broke up with her, then started talking to me fully. From what I see online it looks like they dated over a year.\n\nAnd apparently through the course of us dating, she was contacting him through any means possible: multiple social media accounts, email, and even bank transfers.\n\nBut because nobody at work knows we even dated, I’ve had to remain completely unphased with this information. Like I just have to act normal every day at work as if this wasn’t my entire life.\n\nNow I feel even worse because I don’t know if I could have been a contributing factor to their breakup. And she is - like 7 months after he broke up with her - still reposting about how hurt she is, how her ex cheated on her, and how she still loves him.\n\nMoreover, when he was with me, I can see and have noticed all the ways he would compare me to her. He seemed like he was using me to replace her. He would bring me to all the places they ate at. I’m not even sure what I was. Was I a rebound? Maybe I wasn’t 'better' and he regretted leaving his ex so he dumped me like I was nothing?\n\nMy self-worth is horrible right now. There are times where I’m like maybe I was super boring. I’m not as beautiful or thin or photogenic or interesting as her. Why did he even choose me?\n\nOnline there are sayings that guys always go for someone more convenient. So is that it? I was just easy? I feel like I’m living in the dark. I’m in so much mental pain from this and the worst thing is I feel like I have no right to even get answers as I was just some side chick. Was what we had even a relationship? It wasn’t even a month that we were official. It wasn’t some full blown year relationship, so what gives me the right to be upset or seek answers?\n\nI’m starting to move on from him but his ex just won’t leave my mind. I stalk her social media every day and just pick myself apart when I see her. She’s so beautiful. I just don’t understand when he even spoke to me or liked me. I don’t even know if he actually liked me. This cognitive dissonance is so painful.\n\nI can’t tell anyone about this. Nobody at work knows we even dated. Sometimes it just feels like something that lives in my mind - like a dream or hallucination -and because he hasn’t reached out and we never talked it out, I feel so stupid that it’s still affecting me so much. I feel like I’m just imagining it all and I’m being unreasonable.\n\nHe was my first everything and I feel so naive and stupid. Was I used? It felt so real.\n\nDid he break up with me because he was scared I was going to find out that he didn’t do a clean breakup with his ex? I remember at the start of when we were first talking I told him I wouldn’t have even spoken to him if he wasn’t single and he reassured me he was. Like I had this urk in me that always felt like there was something not adding up -a timeline mismatch or 'the wall' between us. And now I’m thinking the wall was the information he was keeping from me.\n\nAt this point I just wish he would message me a sorry. Just to confirm that it was all real. That I’m not crazy to be so, so hurt. So I can move on.\n\ntldr  \nI met a guy at work in mid-2025 and we slowly built a really intense connection that felt like my first real relationship. Once we made it official, he became distant and it felt like it turned mostly physical with a 'wall' between us. We took a one-month break, then on the day we were meant to try again he switched and a week later dumped me over text with no explanation and refused to talk. Months later I found out he had a long-term girlfriend when we first met and she was still chasing him during/after our time together, so now I’m spiralling wondering if I was a other woman comparing myself to her, and questioning if any of it was real. We still work together and nobody knows we dated, so I’ve had to act normal while thinking about him every day and craving even a simple apology for closure.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768008988.0, "id": "1q8qvt9", "author": "scaramoofan611", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8qvt9/was_i_a_rebound_i_cant_stop_thinking_about_his_ex/"}

It can also be a way to self-soothe if you have a lot of anxiety or other mental health distress. I think we just need to feel what we feel, sadness, anger, a mix of it or anything else, communicate, and then knowing we have done what we could, we start building relationships to meet our relational needs from healthy relationships outside of the house.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I sang at my uncle's funeral yesterday. He took my virginity", "text": "TW: sexual assault, depression, self harm\n\nHe was my father's best friend, no relation. He and my father had been friends since they were young kids. Uncle was a big man: 6'4\", 250 lbs solid, very deep voice and a gentle soul. He was an orthopedic surgeon, a minister, a singer, spoke multiple languages, and had a vast knowledge of music (we bonded over jazz and classical music) and history. He taught me how to play chess. He smoked me at ping pong. He taught me some music theory. I could talk to him about almost anything, I always learned something new when talking to him.\n\nThe thing I loved most was his kindness. I’d confide in him about stuff that was probably silly and childlike, but he at least pretended to be interested. I was silenced at home and forced to bottle things up, but uncle always gave me a safe space. Growing up with a temperamental, irritable father made me walk on eggshells, so it was nice having a male figure that showed me gentleness I didn’t see at home. He knew more about me than my parents did. There were periods where we wouldn’t see him or auntie, but he was only a phone call away. I loved that man. He was wonderful.\n\nMy parents gave me a graduation party at 19. We had a house full of friends and family and of course, uncle and auntie were in attendance. He told me that he’d take care of everything I needed for school for the fall. Two weeks later, he took me to lunch and shopping. Once I finished running him around the city and talking his ear off, he told me that he had something else for me but he left it at home.\n\nIt was only the two of us at his house. We went into his “man cave” because I wanted to see his turntable, so he put on Miles Davis Sketches of Spain. We sat (close) on his couch and talked more. As I got more emotional, he pulled me closer and closer. Nothing unusual. But he made me feel better.\n\nHe leaned in and kissed me. I didn’t mind. I didn’t fight. He was a big incredibly strong man with a strong grip. 6’4” 250 vs 5”3’ 115. Once he had me on my back, I completely froze. I knew I was done for so I tried to calm myself down. I didn’t say no. there are no words to describe how bad my mind raced. I cried silently. My mind and body responded differently. I climaxed multiple times. I didn’t say stop. I never forgave myself for that.\n\nSo I’m not a victim. I didn’t fight back. I didn’t say no. I didn’t say stop.\n\nAfter he took me home, I spent the rest of my night crying in my room. I fell into a deep depression and even attempted suicide. I couldn’t process what happened to me: was it my fault? Was it SA? Did I betray my aunt? I knew for sure I couldn’t say a word. Deep down something felt so wrong but I didn’t want anything to happen to him. My parents would blame me. He was well known so people would shun me. Since I wouldn't say why I was in a funk, my depression and isolation irritated my parents so much that they'd fuss at me for being \"ungrateful\" once a week. I didn’t speak to my uncle for weeks. I blocked him but he found another way to get in contact with me: show up to our house. He found a reason to pop up on any given weekend. He’d come with gifts for all of us but one of mine was extra special: ella in berlin album. He used jazz and got me again.\n\nEach therapist gave me a thorough explanation about consent. One therapist said that it was up to me to decide if it was SA or not. I’ve been wasting their time recalling this story over and over because not only have I still not processed it after all these years but I still loved and admired my uncle. Neither of us spoke about it, I guess we pretended it never happened. We had a decent relationship later. Deciding to bury it was the worst decision I ever made.\n\nThe news of his sudden death tore me up. Looking down at him in his casket ripped me apart. flashbacks came back. I haven’t been able to sleep. The guilt of looking in my aunt’s face after what happened in her home has never left me. I sang 2 verses of come sunday by mahalia jackson (he introduced this song to me) before I embarrassed myself and broke down into tears ending the song abruptly.

I thought he had been at work, he was texting me as if he was, and i found out later that he’d been home for days.\n\nFor some reason this didn’t spark the drug red flag.

Said i understood but don’t approve. Let’s come up with a plan to quit. All the bs. All it did was enable him.\n\nIdk how much he uses now as i asked him to keep it private and i don’t want to see it or be around it, but i know it’s enough to put him in debt and he’s always broke.\n\nThere are constantly bloody soaked tissues in the trash and his nose is beginning to get scabs.\n\nHis mood swings have increased exponentially. Any tiny thing sets him off and i am constantly walking on eggshells around him. During an explosion, he degrades me and mocks my scared reaction to his behavior. Calls me stupid, idiot, dumba\\*\\*, bi\\*\\*\\*, etc. Tells me to shut the f\\*\\*\\* up.\n\nHe then disappears for hours or days, and when he comes back it’s a 50/50 on whether or not he’s in a better mood. If he is, there is no apology or discussion from him unless i ask for a conversation, which he gets mad about every time.\n\nThey’ve become pointless.\n\nWhen he is high, he gets into these very VERY specific moods. It’s like a totally new person takes over his body.\n\nHe is soft spoken, gentle, caring, going over the top for my needs. Communication is amazing, he acts like ‘ normal ‘\n\nBut once it’s worn off he is evil until he uses again, or he sleeps all day every day.\n\nHe doesn’t have a reaction when i tell him how heartbreaking this is for me. How i only feel safe around him when he’s high.\n\nOver the last 4 months my mental health has tanked. It’s like I’ve reverted ten years of growth and like im 15 again. Every drive home from work i get that same pit in my stomach that i would get when i knew id get in trouble after school. So i don’t know if im just really mentally in the shitter and making my problems seem worse than what they actually are.\n\nI’ve never done cocaine, only smoke weed. Maybe im totally wrong in everything im saying like he says i am but I try to talk about his using because i want to understand if this seemingly scheduled abuse is him, or the drugs.\n\n\\*\\*\\* while typing this i saw that he was looking at naked women on Reddit. He’s super secretive about his phone and i suspect he’s also a reddit goner given what i have seen.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Ruined my life and career with TEFL", "text": "TLDR: worked tefl and ruined my finances at a company that massively underpaid me. Now im back in america with a year long gap on my resume and out of the loop with the corporate world. I shouldve just been thankful for the opportunities i was given, instead of throwing it all way to \"take a risk\" and do other pseudo-inspirational, eat, pray, love nonsense.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, TEFL refers to teaching english as a foreign language. Tbh im not in the mood for career advice or feel good comments about how im a badass for taking a risk. I just need this off my chest.\n\nIt all started when I was working a corporate job in business law as a paralegal. My degree is in International Business and tbh i was lucky to be there. Id never even taken a business law class yet somehow was able to weasle my way into this company(which i wont name for privacy reasons). I was the picture of success, especially for an asian man like myself. Finally all those years of filial piety and studying and doing what my family wanted paid off.\n\nI had a stable job, a decent salary of 65k a year, a work from home job, and all the material things a 27 year old guy could want. I had a nice apartment, my dream car, hell i even saved up enough to buy my favorite pistol(i live in the south), a custom 1911(yes yes tell all the boomer fudd jokes you want). \n\nBut i was unfulfilled. I found the job boring and the hours were long. I frequently was working 10-12 hour days, my sleep, mental, and physical health were all degrading fast. So i looked into what else i could do. I remembered a friend of mine who always talked about teaching english abroad. For him his dream country was japan. For me it was israel or hong kong(please refrain from political debates on this thread. Not interested in stirring up controversy). \n\nI ended up choosing Hong Kong for safety reasons and because ive always wanted to train wing chun kung fu. I even had a friend there i met when i studied abroad, so it all seemed to work out really well. So i study hard, get my tefl certification, and apply to any company that would have me.\n\nI just wanted out. This is when i ran into a company that i will name, Monkey Tree ELC. Now this is the one thing that isnt my fault. Monkey Tree(MT), is one of the most notoriously corrupt after school learning centers in the world. They routinely refuse to pay you a full paycheck that was agreed upon by both parties in the employment cintract. They offer apartments for you to stay in, that are dirty and falling apart, and when something breaks in that apartment, you are expected to pay for it.\n\nThey over charge you for rent, in my case $1200 usd a month to stay with 2 roommates. Insane even by hong kong standards. They barely train you for the classroom and frequently give contradictory orders like \"make the class fun but also acadmeic\" \"stick to our teaching schedule to a tee, but also play games.\" \"Its important to sell the course and that the kids enjoy class, but also dont allow them to speak, laugh, or raise their voice above a low murmur.\" And to top it all off the company culture if rife with racism, conformity, and gaslighting. Those who stand up for themselves, like myself, are frequently smacked back down. \"Dont like your pay? Well it isnt our deductions that are the problem. You're just bad with money.\" \"Dont like our racist comments? Well why are you offended, your not really asian. Your american.\" \"Want clarity from management? You americans are so entitled.\" \n\nOverall, i apologize for the long post. But essentially leaving my stable corporate job just left me poor, frustrated, and now jobless as i had to return to america, being unable and unwilling to enable this poor treatment. Now with that approximately year long gap in my resume, doing a job that is known to be abused by travelers as a paid vacation, what company will hire me? Who would want a worker who has been out of the loop for a year now and is a potential risk? I left one company before to go live out my instagram fantasies, in the eyes of an employer, what stops me from doing so to them? \n\nIt all goes to show that im being punished for my arrogance. I arrogantly thought i was the main character and didnt have to work a 9-5 like everyone else. But the traditional path exists for a reason, because its the path that works best of the majority of people. I shouldve been thankful for the success that God gave me instead of thinking i deserve more. Now i dont know if ill ever dig myself out of this hole im in. \n\nThere were some good things that came out of hong kong, i did get to learn wing chun, at ip man's school. I did get to, barely, see my old friend and make new ones. And dating as an asian man was much better in asia than it is here and i met some amazing women over there, who i am either still involved with or friends with now. \n\nBut overall, it still wasnt worth it. Im a man now not a teenage boy. I shouldnt uproot my life just because i like martial arts and beautiful women who are more likely to be attracted to me because i match their beauty standards more closely. Being a man is about survival, doing what you must to get ahead. And ive done a hell of a job at that.\n\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768002822.0, "id": "1q8oihn", "author": "hwarangma27", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8oihn/ruined_my_life_and_career_with_tefl/"}

I feel overwhelmed with every effort. I just feel like there’s constantly something wrong with me. being myself without my fathers input will make him disappointed in me, but changing myself makes me frustrated and depressed. pls give me raw advice and tell me if im really just lazy and making excuses.\n\nupdate: I went out with a guy and lied about it to my parents. i got caught and now my father says that he's done parenting me and I can do whatever I want. He said that since I want to act like an adult I can live with the consequences. I'm in the wrong for lying, but this supposed \"freedom\" feels like a trap. my father told me that if i wanted to see a guy I shouldn't tell him. but i thought that reasoning was flawed because how do i tell him my plans without lying? it's not like i can just leave the house without telling anyone. i can i lie and say i'm with a friend or i tell the truth. either way he's upset with me. i cannot win. now that i've been caught i'm not really speaking with my father all that much. for more context, a couple weeks before i had a talk with my dad about how i wasn't going to date in high school, but i had already been asked out by said guy. i told my dad and he got upset with me for telling him since he doesn't want to know. for even more context, i'm south asian. since we already had this talk about dating me going behind his back is even worse but i literally confessed to my sins not an hour later. i don't know. i see no way out. please help. i still wanna see the guy but i dont wanna upset my dad anymore.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768002816.0, "id": "1q8oif8", "author": "your_one-and-only", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8oif8/im_so_tired/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I lived in another country and realized how closed off my antisocial home country made me", "text": "I'm (19F) from a country where socializing is not very typical. We avoid any kind of contact with strangers, saying hi to old friends, talking to cashiers or any type of customer service. This is what I've grown up around and it's all I know. Last year I moved to another country for some months, where everyone was so incredibly social and talkative. Small talk, smiling at strangers, the feeling of community all felt so foreign to me. I consider myself an extrovert in my country, but I was still sometimes overwhelmed with the amount of socialization I had to do there. \n\nAccording to my country's standards, I'm a big extrovert and very bubbly and talkative. This got me to some people's bad sides, especially in elementary and middle school. I had long time friends admitting to me later on in life that they found me insufferable when I was younger. It wasn't uncommon for me to get avoided, excluded, or called out on my attention-seeking behavior (is what they called it). I've always been an open book and I enjoy talking. Slowly I learned to close myself off more, and started keeping things more to myself. Reflecting on how people reacted to me when I was younger and confessed how insufferable I was to them has made me insecure of expressing my emotion now due to the fear of losing my loved ones. I'm stuck thinking that if I need to get my emotions out somewhere, I'm trying to seek attention and if I cave in and tell someone, they'll see me for who I am and cut me off for being annoying. \n\nOne thing I held on to was being complimented on my good listening and comforting skills. It was the main positive feedback I got from my peers in school or online platforms. I do love comforting people and offer help whenever I can, because I want everyone to have at least one person they know they can run to if they need anything, maybe because I know how it's like to feel otherwise. In my country not many people take me up on the offer. \n\nIn the country I moved to everyone was suddenly so open. They talked about all kinds of issues and standard life things that I haven't discussed with anyone so openly before, not even my closest family or friends back home. I felt like I gained a new, much wider perspective on life that I really enjoyed. I felt myself defrosting just a bit, able to talk about some more complex topics. \n\nI still feel like I'm stuck in an unhealthy loop of always giving comfort, never receiving it. I listen to my friends' problems very willfully but I feel like there is an invisible wall blocking me from talking to them about mine. There is years of conditioning to stay quiet behind me and I just can't do it, no matter how open everyone is.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I never lost my extroverted spark and I still talk a lot, just about all the happy things and whatnot. The stuff below the surface is just very difficult for me to discuss. The fall of 2024 was the most difficult time in my life by far, and I feel like I never got over it properly. Reflecting on my stay in the other country has made me more willing to go through all that happened to put it past me in a more healthy way than what I've done now. But I don't know where to start in my home country, which I have returned to. I'm back to my old friends who I love dearly, but who avoid eye contact and stand silently if anything below surface level is being discussed, and to my friends online, who are too tangled up in their own lives to be able to listen to me (I might be slightly sour toward them due to some past experiences, haven't gotten past this either besides just shoving it down - because again, nobody to really talk to). \n\nAnyway, just had to get this all off my chest.

I hope this year it will get better", "text": "I had a pretty rough start to my young adulthood, but I’ll try my best to summarize it. When I was 17, I ran away from home and became homeless for a while because my parents didn’t accept that I was nonbinary, and their abuse made me want to leave.\n\nAfter I turned 18 and graduated from high school, I realized I couldn’t live on the streets any longer, so I went back to live with my parents. I went through a lot of trauma from being bullied for 12 years in school. When I turned 18, I started therapy, but it didn’t help much. At 19, I attempted suicide because I felt lost, scared of adulthood, and unsure of what I wanted to do with my life. Thankfully, the attempt failed.\n\nAfter that, I tried DBT therapy for six months, but I was eventually kicked out because I was too physically ill to attend regularly—I was battling an autoimmune disease and had a broken foot at the time.\n\nWhen I turned 20, I went to college but dropped out because my tutors weren’t helping me succeed. At 21, I tried college again, but I was homeless, which made it almost impossible to keep up, so I dropped out once more. The homeless shelter I was staying in wasn’t helping me get back on my feet, so I eventually moved back in with my parents for a while—but things got really bad again. My parents continued to be physically and emotionally abusive, so I left and became homeless again at 22.\n\nI still didn’t know what I wanted to do at that age, so I worked part-time jobs and kept going to therapy, though it didn’t seem to help, and I remained emotionally unstable as usual. Now, I’m 23 and have been living in a homeless shelter for almost a year. I’m hoping this year will be better than the last.\n\nI missed the deadline to go back to college in the spring, but I hope to enroll for the summer semester. I also plan to try DBT therapy again this year. I really want to become more productive, even while I’m homeless, because I feel like I’ve missed out on a lot during my young adulthood.\n\nIf you’ve read this, thank you.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "My friend almost died because of me", "text": "I almost killed my friend and I don’t know if I can forgive myself for it. For context, we became friends the summer before ninth grade. We met at summer camp. Me and my friend, Amy, were planning to get “married”. For those of you who don’t know, marriages at camp are almost always just for kicks and giggles. Many friends get married at camp—-it doesn’t mean anything romantic. I noticed that there was this one boy that was very closed off. I wanted to make him feel included, so I asked him to be the pastor at my wedding. From that day on, everything was a blur. He told me he was going to the same school I was next year so I was excited to have a new friend. One year later, we became close friends pretty quickly. We didn’t hang out outside of school much because my parents were very strict. However, I invited him to pretty much every outing I had. (Which was not many) and we were pretty much inseparable. Around November, in 10th grade, he started to change. He became snappier, more distant, and very controlling. I knew he was sad, so I tried to be there as long as possible for him. We have always had harsh ways of teasing each other but there were never any hard feelings. I noticed how he started to change so I tried to tone down the teasing. He would do things like tell me he won’t eat food if I don’t exclusively sit with him at lunch everyday, make fun of my acne every single second of every single day, shame me for not understanding his non verbal social cues that I was supposed to pick up on or whatever. He always had a way of making me feel inferior but this time he was being wayyy harsher. I called him out for being insecure one day. I said that maybe if he was a nicer person, I wouldn’t be his only friend. He gave me the silent treatment from that day on. Sometimes I’d catch him laughing at my jokes or staring at me but he never cared enough to try and fix things. Soon, the meaningful glances would turn into hateful stares. I have a very vivid memory of me talking to a friend in the hallway and noticing his mean glances in the corner of my eye. When I gave my presentation, he gave me the meanest look ever. I know it wasn’t a big deal, but I’m a very sensitive person. Two of his friends that I was also friends with reached out to me. They told me they noticed the boy’s behavior had changed a lot. They told me about the things he said about me. He made fun of my major depressive disorder, called me ugly, said he didn’t care for my feelings, and went as far as to slander my best friend, L’s face. I was so upset that he would do something like that to me. I had put up with his shit for nearly two years and this is how he repayed me!? When he found out his two friends were talking to me, he immediately kicked them out of their friend group. I was sooo pissed! I left him the nastiest paragraph to get back at him. I mentioned his appearance, told him he can’t be calling people ugly when he looks like that, said he was gonna live a miserable life if he kept treating people like this, told him I’d ruin his life by reporting his bullying, used a lot of cuss words, and called him a crazy psychopath. The next day, he tried to take his own life. Luckily, he survived. It took him around a month to physically recover (just an estimate). It has been ten months since this has happened. Recently, his sister confronted me at school to tell me that what I did was fucked up. Apparently, he is an alcoholic now. All his friends left him because they didn’t like the person he became. Everyone keeps telling me that it wasn’t my fault, but I feel like it was. If you got to the end of this, thank you for listening to me.

The worst part is that everybody knew it happened, including the management, but they refused to do anything.

These type of jokes happened a few more times. \n\nI’ve talked to other students and turns out it is pretty usual at my university with all kinds of professors and the university management always covers them up. It is also highly possible that there is some fraudulent stuff happening with funds, but honestly I don’t care about it now.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Sometimes, I'm disgusted by my boyfriend", "text": "We've been dating for 6 years and living together for 1. He is 25 years old.\n\nHe doesn't regularly brush his teeth or floss. Sometimes digs his nose and puts it in his teeth or, if he's driving, on the car seat. Doesn't clean his ears and the crust is easily visible. He showers using his hand even though I bought him a shower puff. He also can't reach his back because sometimes I can still smell the sweat on him when we cuddle. He's coughed up phlegm in the middle of the night  and spat it into a cup at our bedside (this was a regular occurrence when he stopped smoking but hasn't happened for a while now). I didn't know his shower schedule before we moved in together but when we did, it was clear he didn't prioritize it. I think he's a daily showerer now but recently, we had a moment... \n\nHe was laying on the couch after work and I told him I could smell his feet, to which he had no reaction. A few hours later, he was ready to hop into bed and I asked him to go shower first. He got upset that I didn't ask him to do it sooner and that led to a fight where I told him I feel like his parent sometimes. We've had conversations about his hygiene twice before but that talk was intense and it felt like we were going to break up. Since then, he has been brushing his teeth daily but the other things are still etched in my memory. It takes one trigger and suddenly I'm thinking about them all. \n\nI sometimes think about how bad his living situation was when we met. A few bad circumstances meant he had to move back to his mother's house and live in the garage for 2 years. There were flies, rubbish, food scraps, bottles and other things everywhere. His mother's dog even pooped in there a few times. He would always clean up and burn some incense when I got there though. I never wanted to judge him because it was clear this stems from the toxic and neglectful environment he was raised in. He moved to his own place after that and the conditions were better but still not great. I had family who lived close by but, since I grew up in extreme cleanliness at all times, we kind of agreed on never inviting them over to his place.\n\nOf course our place together is in great condition, I've designated the spare room as his space to be dirty in. That way, the rest of the house can stay clean and tidy. The problem though, is that he still tends to be a be dirty around the house too and when I tidy up after him, I get reminded of all the things above. I'm deeply in love with him but I think, I think that's why I'm not very sexual with him. When I am in the mood, I always ask him to take a shower beforehand and most times he's happy to but our sex-life has fallen a bit flat recently. It's amazing when it happens but I don't think either of us are interested in initiating as much because it takes too much effort. \n\nThis whole thing hurts my heart because I've loved being with him so much. He's always treated me so well, is so kind, generous and supportive and even helped me grow into the person I am. I don't think I'd be the same with anyone else so I really just want him to get the bad habits and behaviours under control because I worry I have an \"ick\" forming.\n\nI don't know what else to do...", "score": 73, "num_comments": 74, "created_utc": 1767997061.0, "id": "1q8m65e", "author": "Informal_Zombie_7411", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8m65e/sometimes_im_disgusted_by_my_boyfriend/"}

Let him know his hygiene and organization are affecting you, that you've realized you're enabling him by cleaning up after him and developing resentment so from now on, you're gonna stop cleaning up after him and instead of making it a thing or pointing it out verbally, you're going to leave blank sticky notes or stickers next to those things as a way to let him know you've seen it and he needs to address it.  If he still doesn't, then definitely make it an ultimatum. He's not a child but a grown adult, and you can love him all you want but he won't change unless he wants to. If he loves you the same, he will go above and beyond to become self aware of his habits and try to be as clean as possible for you. \nYou've already touched upon the subject with him, he doesn't seem to have the overall urgency needed.

It’s probably better just to get it all out at once since it’s really just about one thing in the end, his hygiene. If you just keep bringing it up one thing at a time he may start to see it as nagging. Which will only cause fights. When you talk to him don’t go at him in a way that will just make him defensive.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I feel like I've made bad life choices.", "text": "I know this is probably a bit of an overreaction. But I've always been sort of placed in the \"arts\" category, and I basically rejected any sort of STEM things. I always felt like I was really bad at it, even though it was really interesting to me, and was very talented in English literature and such. So now I'm doing an English language and literature degree, because I felt like it was the only thing I was really good enough to do a degree in (and I do actually like it). It's basically organised as half of a literature degree and half of a linguistics degree. And I was doing a module for linguistics recently that was very technical. It involved a lot of anatomy and then physics in the theory, and then using a computer program to take measurements of speech sounds and doing a data analysis of them. I thought I would hate it and it seems like everyone else in my class did, but I really liked it, even though it was hard.\n\nI was sitting here today, and thinking back, and I realised that my grades for STEM have pretty much always been equal to my other grades, even though I always thought I was terrible at them. I had a very artsy family and friend group, and they always grimaced about STEM things. For example, I'm from the UK, and when I chose my A levels, I took biology and everyone told me it was a terrible idea and I'd be making a mistake.\n\nAnyways, taking that module with more science and maths made me remember that I actually do really like that kind of work, probably over any of the literature that I do. I'm also autistic, and I'm terrible with people, so most of the jobs that the graduates in my department do won't work for me, like marketing, PR or teaching. Plus, any other jobs don't make much money and I know the market for graduates is bad enough for anyone, let alone someone that has other limitations. So basically, I've realised that I'm probably blocked from most work that I can get with my degree and I'll never really get the chance to do anything in the STEM/technical area either. So I really don't know what I'm going to do with my life now. I feel like I've had every path cut off for me, or at least all the ones that won't make me miserable.\n\nTo be fair, I doubt my choices fairly regularly. In the summer, before I started my degree, I pretty much had a crisis over whether to change to something else, and then decided to stay on my current course. I doubt going to university at all and basically every choice I've ever made.\n\nI know the probably obvious answer would be to drop out and do something else, but I pretty much can't. First, because of how the education system works here, I don't have the qualifications in STEM. Also, and I know this will seem like a really stupid reason, I just can't do with all the doubt and surprise from my family/friends. I know that they'd think I'm stupid to do it, and that shouldn't matter but it just does. Unless there was something that literally blocked me from continuing my degree, I'm stuck on the path.\n\nAnyway, it's silly and, like all of my crises, I'll probably get over it eventually, but whenever I get stuck in this mindset, no matter what it's about, I get pretty miserable and obsessive over it. I can't think about anything except that until it goes and I can't sleep for more than a couple hours, which is quite inconvenient since I have essays due soon and I can't think straight for long enough to write them.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767994553.0, "id": "1q8l371", "author": "Defiant-Professor266", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8l371/i_feel_like_ive_made_bad_life_choices/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I still carry resentment towards my ex boyfriend, and I hate it.", "text": "This is a long post, but this boy (and yes I'm saying boy and not man about a 21 year old because he acted like a child) did a lot of shit, so please bear with me.\n\nBack in June I (F22)  started dating my ex. My best friend set us up because she thought that we would make a great couple, and for a while I thought we did. Not long after we started dating we began fighting alot, and by alot I mean almost every night. Most of the times it would be over the same things that I had thought we had already resolved.\n\nThe things we would permanently be fighting about were the following:\n1) He didn't like the way I dressed (shorts, crop tops, etc.). He said that the way I was dressing was me advertising myself to the world, and that I wanted men to look at me. I refused to change how I dressed because I'm 22, and he wants me to be dressed like someone in their 30's. Not that there's anything wrong with that style of clothes, its just not my style. He even went out of his way to ask older people if they approved of the way people our age dressed. He would make a fuss about what I was wearing almost every time we went out, and he only really ever called me beautiful if it was in something he was happy with. \n\n2) I belong to a dayhouse in university, meaning that we have events where we get together with some of the other dayhouses or residences for the night, usually with fun themes and when it's a social one, usually with alcohol. He wasn't in one of these dayhouse's and he doesn't drink so we would constantly be fighting about the fact that I go to these events with my best friend, especially when it's with a male residence/dayhouse. Because why would I want to go to something like that if I have a boyfriend? I rarely interact with the other people we had the event with and just did it as a fun experience with my friends. He would complain the whole night while I was there, and basically forbade me from drinking, and even showed up to get me because he didn't want me there.\n\n3) He had a huge dislike for my friend group, which basically consists out of me, my best friend, her younger brother and his best friend. Our group had a tradition of playing pool on Tuesday's because it was free, and he hated that I went with them to go play, especially when he wasn't invited . Everytime I wanted to do something with my friends he would make me feel like shit and start a fight, which led to me distancing myself from them, because I didn't have the energy to fight with him constantly, as well as still being a full time student.\n\n4) A whole mess regarding the reason he wasn't invited out anymore - He was invited initially, until he made a big scene the one night when we were playing pool. He wanted to play with me, but was currently busy with a game with my best friends boyfriend. So me and my best friend decided we were going to go play a round until they were done. We had barely begun our game, when he came over and asked me why I was playing with her and not him. My best friend offered for him to take over from her but he refused and went back to my best friend's bf. Somewhere after that her brother wanted to speak to her so our other friend took over and we continued the game. He then came over, told me that he was going home because I was being disrespectful by not playing with him. Mind you he was my ride, so I told him that I would go with him, and he just said I should finish my game and then we could leave. He turns to walk away and the brother ask me whats going on, I tell him that I'm just finishing the game then I'm leaving with him. He jokes that its fucked up that I'm staying to finish the game, ex doesn't hear the full conversation and basically picks a fight with the brother, because he thinks the brother called him fucked up. It's a whole thing, and afterwards no one wanted anything to do with him anymore. We had a huge fight when we got home, and I went to stay at my best friends place for the night because I didn't want to be alone. The next day when I went to check on him, I learned that he hadn't slept the whole night, and then when I tried getting him to bed he passed out on the floor. I got him woken up and into bed, and then I left, because I already had plans for the day, and I knew that all of this was so that I didn't spend time with my best friend. After this he kept arguing about the fact that I didn't pick him over my friends because I respected their wishes not to bring him around them, constantly making me feel like shit about it.\n\nWe fought about a lot of other things, but those were the main one's that constantly kept coming up. I thought that if we could work through them we would be fine, but that was stupid of me because these fights continued to happen until the day we broke up.\n\nOther things he did that drove me up the walls in anger were the following:\n1) I had this one friend who I have been friends with since I was 16. And we have a past, but we don't really talk anymore unless I see him somewhere as we run in the same friend groups. Two of my other best friends are getting marries this year, and I'm the maid of honour and he's the best man. I obviously told my ex about our past, because we were on the topic of exes, and because we still see each other from time to time. He didn't not like this at all, telling me to delete his number. Which I didn't want to do because within this year we are going to have to talk to each other about wedding stuff, and I'm not going to make the bride and groom be the middle man because he's uncomfortable. I told him that if it really bothers him I'll delete the friends number after the wedding. Which I didn't want to do, because we're still friends, but I would have. He still didn't like that and kept fighting with me about it until I eventually just deleted the number because I was tired of hearing about it every other day.\n\n2) He gave me ultimatums about drinking and tattoos. Like I said earlier he doesn't drink, and forbade me frome drinking. He also doesn't liek the fact that I already have tattoos, and told me that I am forbidden from getting more. Through this conversation I just stared at him not saying a word because I was dumbfounded. I kinda knew the relationship was over at this point, because no one will te me what I can and can't do with my own body. Especially not a man.\n\n3) Everytime I went out with anyone, be it my friends or family and he couldn't come with, or I was obviously not on my phone because I'm spending time with people, he would begin an argument and ruin my whole night. And this wasn't like one of twice, this was every time.\n\n4) He would gaslight me about things I never said. For example, one of the residences has a big event every year. Me and my best friend usually share bottles of wine at any event hosted at the place the event was taking place, because it's cheaper that way. That night he picked a fight because he said that I apparently said that I would only have two bottles of wine (shared), which I know I didn't say, because I wasn't planning on drinking that little ( I usually only get four glasses of wine out of two bottles) so not a lot for someone who has a very high alcohol tolerance. Till this day he'll say that I said that I'd only share two bottles with my best friend. \n\nThere's a lot more, but I feel like this is getting to long.\n\nEverytime I knew I was going to brake up with him, he kept buying me expensive things, and my family is not that well of. So I felt bad about it, and it made me feel like I couldn't leave him, because he had just spent a lot of money on me. Which I now know was a manipulation tactic on his part.\n\nWhen we finally broke up, he broke up with me. He said that he could see I was unhappy and he didn't want to keep me in a relationship that I was getting hurt in. I was sad when it happened, but when he left and I went to my best friend's place, I came to realize that our relationship was really fucking toxic, and that I was glad that we were broken up. The next morning he messaged me that he wanted to talk. The talk was basically him begging for another chance, but I stood my ground, and told him no and that we weren't good together. He told me that he accepted it and he left. \n\nLater I went to pick up some of my stuff at his place because I was going home for vacation. He was supposed to be gone already but he was still there. He then proceeded to beg me again for another chance. I had the same conversation I had with him earlier that day. And he eventually said he understood and we left it at that, or so I thought.\n\nThe next week would basically be him just begging me every other day for another chance, over and over again, for hours on end. And I kept telling him no, and he just wouldn't listen to me. The saterdag before I was suposed to go back to university I was out with my parents for lunch and he did the same thing again, and basically messaged me for an hour straight (69 message in total in that hour). The only reason I hadn't blocked him yet was because he still had a lot of my stuff, and I wanted to stop the whole begging thing because I didn't want him to do it again when I had to see him for the swapping of our stuff. He probably sent me over 1000 messages in that week, and I probably said no over 60 times.\n\nWe got to the agreement that I would give his things to my best friend, where he could then leave my stuff and get his. Unfortunately, I forgot that I had his apartment key as well, which resulted in him coming to my apartment. My best friend at least came with, so I wasn't alone when he confronted me about all the things I gave back (hoodies, shirts, etc. of his that I was unsure if he wanted back or not). This then led to another massive fight in the parking lot of my apartment complex. Where he was insulting my best friend in the most vile ways, and I actually felt sacred of him for the first time. \n\nMe, my best friend and her boyfriend went back to my apartment afterwards to put away all my stuff, and when we left my apartment, he cornered us by the door (I live on the third floor), where he started insulting my best friend again, and wanted to get to me, why I do not know, but my best friend stood between us. I've never wanted to push someone down a flight of stairs more in my life.\n\nI haven't seen him since then, but my father came to stay with me until I was done with exams, because my apartment complex is connected to his with a gate, and I was scared that he would show up again, and what he would do if he did. \n\nAnd after all this I hate him. I know we're not supposed to hate people, but I do. Everytime I put something on, I hear his voice in the back of my head. I hate my body because he didn't like that I was really skinny and kept feeding me food. I only later found out that he likes his girls a little more curvy. I've been trying to lose the weight but I'm really struggling. I went on vacation in December and I kept thinking about how he would have ruined it because he wasn't there. I keep thinking about all the things he did to me. And I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it. I wish I would have just left him after the pool thing. My life would have been so much better. I don't want to him to influence me anymore.\n\nSorry that this was a long rant. I've talked about this plenty of times with my friends, but I feel like its been discussed and it's over with. I don't want to burden them with the fact that I'm still so angry and resentful.\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767993309.0, "id": "1q8kk0l", "author": "Jadeee_vdl", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8kk0l/i_still_carry_resentment_towards_my_ex_boyfriend/"}
{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Processing grief, heartbreak, and exhaustion all at once", "text": "This is a long post. I’m not looking for advice; I just need this space to vent months of pent-up frustration.\n\nMy mother was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer some time ago. By the time it was detected, the disease had already spread to multiple parts of her body, and the prognosis was extremely grim. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to face. Waking up each day knowing I was slowly moving closer to what lay ahead broke something inside me quietly. I wasn’t ready for this. Not yet.\n\nFourteen months ago, in the middle of this crisis, I met my girlfriend, and we began a relationship. I found emotional refuge in her. She became my anchor during my worst moments; every scan, every progression, every update. I would break down for hours, and she would stay by my side without wavering. I shared my deepest fears about losing my mother, and she would patiently and calmly talk me through them.\n\nOur relationship was never ordinary. Despite demanding professional lives, we cared for each other in ways neither of us had experienced before. We often spoke about how love had never felt this warm or reassuring. Even while dealing with my own anticipatory grief, I made sure she had space to express her feelings and fears. She is differently abled, and we spoke at length about her anxieties, her paranoia, and how to make life more accessible and easier for her. For the last six months, we were in a long-distance relationship due to work, but we made sure to meet whenever possible.\n\nThings were holding together, until one day, everything fell apart.\n\nMy mother’s condition worsened, and she was put on daily radiation therapy. Driving her to the hospital each day was emotionally devastating. Watching the treatment drain her, while forcing myself to stay composed for her sake, pushed me past limits I didn’t know I had. Crying didn’t change reality, but neither did pretending I was okay.\n\nDuring this time, my mother and I were living in a rented apartment. In the middle of her radiation therapy, our landlord wrongfully evicted us. I could either fight him legally or find us a new place immediately. I didn’t have the strength left in me for another battle. While managing her treatment, I vacated our home and moved us overnight.\n\nAs if this wasn’t enough, I was assigned an extremely gruelling role at work with intense pressure and hours.\n\nFor three weeks, I survived on less than two hours of sleep a day. I lost consciousness twice from sheer exhaustion. I was constantly drained, struggling to stay present, or even track what time of the day it was. I pushed through each day carrying immense physical and emotional pain, just to keep things afloat.\n\nAnd then the final blow landed.\n\nMy girlfriend called me and ended the relationship over the phone. In that moment, everything stopped making sense. I felt completely hollowed out.\n\nDuring those same three weeks while my life was unraveling, she was on her first international trip. We had spoken about it extensively before she left. She was extremely excited and I was genuinely happy for her. Despite everything that I was dealing with, I checked in on her every day. I sensed a growing distance in her replies but conceded to her attributing it to travel fatigue. I simply didn’t have the emotional capacity in me to question it further.\n\nShe called me two days after returning and said it wasn’t working anymore. She said my mother’s ongoing illness made it difficult for her to share her happiness with me. She felt guilty if she shared it and suffocated if she didn’t. She said she was tired, that this wasn’t how she wanted to live, and that she wanted to break up.\n\nUp to this point, I understood her perspective. I respected it and let her walk away peacefully. I was emotionally numb and too exhausted to react.\n\nUntil she texted me later that night.\n\nShe sent long paragraphs describing me in extremely degrading terms, listing what she called my behavioural flaws under the label of “constructive feedback.” I begged her to stop, explaining that it was pushing me towards a breakdown in the middle of the night, but she didn’t stop.\n\nAfter systematically tearing apart my character, she moved on to criticizing my body and weight, despite knowing in detail about my stress-induced eating disorder. She described my appearance as deeply agonising and causing irreversible emotional distance.\n\nThat was the point where I realised I needed to protect myself. And I blocked her.\n\n⸻\n\nFour days later, once I had calmed down enough to function, I unblocked her. She didn’t really apologise for what had happened, but we spoke on and off for about two weeks. During this time, I even helped her with a job switch application. I was doing all of this in the hopes of a reconciliation, because I genuinely loved her and needed her in my life. At that point, she felt like the only emotional support I had left.\n\nWhen I eventually tried to talk about boundaries, something as basic as asking for clarity around calls, she told me that engaging with me was making her so anxious that she felt physically sick, and that I needed to give her time and distance. Even though it was clear by then that she had moved further away from me than ever, I respected what she asked for and stepped back.\n\nI went completely no contact for four weeks.\n\nIt wasn’t easy. The reality of everything I was dealing with finally caught up to me. I broke down every single day. I cried myself to sleep, inconsolably and struggling to even breathe properly. My appetite disappeared, my body associated food with shame and abandonment. I would forget to eat for entire days, and when I did, it felt mechanical. My chest felt constantly stiff, and my body stayed in a near-permanent state of panic all day.\n\nWhen I felt I had given her enough time and space, I reached out again, casually. We spoke about trivial life updates until I eventually broke down and told her how difficult things had become for me, how overwhelmed I felt, and how badly I needed her. I told her I was willing to work on myself and on everything that had gone wrong. In that moment, I let go of my self-worth and self-respect, because the pain of losing the only person who had felt like an anchor was unbearable. None of it was acknowledged. My calls went unanswered. My messages and voice notes were ignored.\n\nOut of desperation and as last resort, I reached out to a few of her friends, hoping they could help mediate or at least get her to speak to me. I was polite, sincerely apologetic, and clear that I didn’t want to cause them any trouble. None of them responded. That was when she finally replied, angrily, accusing me of harassment and responding to me with extreme hostility.\n\nWhat followed is something I still struggle to process.\n\nShe mocked my mother’s illness. She told me to “man up” and stop behaving like a baby about my situation. She said that if she could end a past relationship with someone grieving his parent’s death and be unapologetic about it, then my ongoing situation with my mother would never make a dent in her mind. I tried to explain myself. I asked for empathy. The conversation kept escalating until I was completely depleted and emotionally shut down.\n\nEventually, I stopped responding, not because I found closure, but because I had nothing left to offer.\n\nSince then, I’ve been deeply unsettled. There is a constant physical discomfort in my body that doesn’t seem to ease. My anxiety shows up in my breathing, in my sleep crashes, in my inability to focus at work, and in how hard it feels to get through basic daily tasks. I later realised that even while we were together, she had already begun emotionally gravitating elsewhere. I also found out that my breakup and emotional collapse became a subject of mockery among her close friends.\n\nI’m struggling to reconcile how someone who once held me together during the worst period of my life could eventually treat my pain with such cruelty and nonchalance. I’m not writing this to vilify her or to seek validation; I’m writing because I’m trying to make sense of how love can transform into something so unrecognisable. And how I’m supposed to carry all of this while continuing to show up for my mother and for life.\n\n⸻\n\nI’m not looking for judgements, diagnoses, or advice. Writing this is simply a part of me trying to process everything I’ve been carrying alone for months. If you’ve read this far, thank you for holding space for me. I might not be able to engage further, but I might sleep slightly well tonight knowing I could put this somewhere outside my own head.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767993151.0, "id": "1q8khj2", "author": "Key-Effective-3088", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8khj2/processing_grief_heartbreak_and_exhaustion_all_at/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I think my boyfriend might be a pedophile.", "text": "Hello, I think my boyfriend(21M) might be a pedophile. I’ve(22F) been with my boyfriend since we were children. We got along really well but the problem is, he was never faithful. A lot of emotional cheating and it didn’t get physical until we literally turned 18 and graduated high school. I‘m in a poor financial situation and I don’t exactly have the best relationship with my mother whenever it’s time for her to actually be my mother and not a friend. We love each other but I can’t rely on her like you would the average mother. At the time there was a lot of emotional and verbal abuse I was facing from her when this all happened.\n\nMy mother is one of those older women that has to complain about something and especially have someone to complain at. Usually it’s my older sister but my sister had her own problems going on at the time so my mother knew she couldn’t direct her random bursts of anger at her and instead passed it onto me. I ended up dropping out of college due to the stress of school alongside my home life, being unable to really make friends, especially without my boyfriend on my back like an hawk, and not having any resources to really help me. The only person I’ve been really able to talk to and rely on has been my boyfriend. I was also unfortunately one of the many people unable to get a job too. A lot of unfortunate things going on. A year prior at the time, he sexually assaulted me. I had gone to the police awhile later with a friend but unfortunely, the law doesn’t care about rape and especially women. They dismissed what happened by the fact that we were a couple. I left him during this of course and had provided all the information needed for them to verify it‘s him, text messages of him straight up admitting it, his location, his number, and everything necessary to connect him to what I was reporting. Nothing came of it and of course my financial problems didn’t do away, so I didn’t have much of a choice but to go back. All my “friends” were secretly talking shit about each other, and my real friends had all ended up moving away. I’ve been stuck in an emotionally and mentally draining relationship for almost 10 years now.\n\nI have an iPad with his apple info because it’s an old ass iPad I stopped using so he started using it for a bit and he ended up forgetting he was logged in. I never reminded him or logged out because I wanted to know if he was cheating. I don’t even particularly care about emotional cheating anymore especially at this time, I just wanted to make sure nothing physical happened because at this time I was new to sex and was sadly still sleeping with this man. I didn’t want to risk getting BV or something else because because the girl he initially cheated on me with likely gave me BV. I could be just acting like a hater because he‘s not hygienic and I have to make him shower before I agree to have sex with him. So it’s very likely he could’ve given me BV as well from just being unhygienic.\n\nWhen I had went to his files, I had seen some long screenshots of women and I didn’t particularly care until I saw two women that were small, dainty, and resembled children. Not because they were thin but because they physically looked barely developed and had child like faces. As if she was like 12-14. One of them specifically might actually be a teenager. The screenshot is from a ”tribute” website and a lot of these men practically dox these girls. Looking up her specific name brings up “Snapchat teen exposed” so I’m not sure if this is apart of her appeal of looking like a child or if she actually is. I can’t find anything regarding this girl within the past few years. There was one other girl that semi resembled the disgusting girl he cheated with. Which tbh I don’t really care about for irrelevant reasons and the pictures I mentioned prior are my main concern. This was in mid 2024 and it’s always stuck in the back of my mind. He’s predominantly goes after thicker or plus sized women, but he has developed interest in women that I and a few others agreed looked mostly like children even if they were in our grade or younger. They would be very small and petite women who were on the quieter side. I had originally found out he was cheating through my dreams. After finding those photos, I had been having dreams for maybe 6 months on and off of him being romantic or sexual with children or specifically a younger friend of ours that he used to flirt with. I wasn’t told of this until years later but I only knew she liked him. He’s a very desperate man for attention so I’m not surprised or ever doubted her that this occurred. But I know he would only use her the same way he has with every other woman he has dated too. After all this though he’s been supposedly on his best behavior but because I’ve known him for so long, I really think he was just learning to hide his behavior better.\n\nAt the end of December, Tiktok had allowed “profile visit history” or at the very least that’s when I learned of it. I looked at his and it was predominantly random women which again, I don’t care much about. But my main concern was that there were some 18 year olds and especially specific page that said “twerkteens.” The account was blank with no uploads or anything but the fact that he had even clicked on someone’s profile with that name? On this instagram accounts, if you searched up a singular letter, there would usually be younger girls in high school or the pages of specifically the high school girls sports teams for the city that we’re in. I had showed him this and he gaslighted me for about 6 months until December when I found the ”twerkteens” thing on tiktok and had to nag him to get him to admit what he was looking at, was exactly what I predicted long ago. He’s always had a porn addiction that he most of the time knows how to hide. When discussing what I found he said that sometimes when watching porn he falls into that category of teen because there’s just so much stuff there. He kept trying to say he looks at both women and teens as if that’s somehow supposed to make it better that he’s including adult women while looking at teens. Whether they’re 18 or not, we’ve had discussions regarding people who look at this kind of shit and he knows it’s wrong and weird.\n\nHe says he’ll go to therapy but it’s been a couple of days now, and he hasn’t booked an appointment. Just some searches to find someone to get help. What kind of person would he need to make an appointment for this? Psychiatrist? Psychologist? Therapist?  He doesn’t have insurance so he would have to pay out of pocket. I always knew he was a loser but it’s sad to see its worse than what I initially knew from the start. I don’t feel like the police would take this seriously even if I reported him with evidence because they didn’t when I had reported him with proof for assaulting me and they’d likely just see me as some bitter or crazy woman. I obviously don’t see a future with this man and I need to find another job because I lost it for issues regarding my fibroids flaring up and making it hard to even literally stand. Can anyone tell me what specifically he needs so this problem doesn’t progress? I don’t want him hurting anyone.\n\nUPDATE: Just edited it to have paragraphs. Hope that helps!\n\nUPDATE 2: Yes I’m aware this relationship sucks that’s not what I’m here for and I WILL be leaving. I‘m asking what resources can does he need to get better.

This is my first time posting on reddit so I'll try to make it easy to read and not a big block of text. I also don't know what tags to use, but odvious trigger warning because of the topic. I hope this is the right subreddit to post in.\n\nFor some background, I (16f) have been friends with \"Tia\" (15f) since middle school. We used to be extremely close since I was a new student, weird and thought she was the coolest person ever. Our whole friendship I've known her grandpa was a creep, because of offhand and nasty comments he would make compairing our bodies. He used to call my phone all the time and he found my facebook and added me. He never sent messages because I guess he doesn't know how to? Thats what Tia would say anyways.\n\nWhen we got to hs we kinda drifted, since I only had lunch and 4th block with her and she also started acting really really weird and it was kind of hard having a normal conversation with her. I didn't go to her house anymore since her grandma hated me and her grandpa is a nasty perv. This year I'm a sophmore and she flunked I think, so we don't have like any classes together anymore. She'd been acting even weirder, she kept texting me talking about how she knew I liked the dude she liked and how I should just admit it since they never dated anyways. I really don't he isn't my type. But since she'd been acting so weird and also I had a new friend group and kind of changed myself since ms we didn't really talk except for the occasional times she'd text asking to hang out.\n\nWednesday at midnight she sent me a video of her grandpa at her doorway saying disgusting things about how she couldn't handle him and how he banged her good (i changed the words a lot because he was really vulger and also i dont want ppl to realize im the poster). I freaked out, it was terrifying and I don't know why it really hit my heart bad. I told her she needed to go to the police and she was being confusing in her messages but said she wanted to run away and come over.\n\nI don't know why but i didn't do anything until yesterday. I went to the store after school and saw her and we hugged and talked briefly. She told me that she wasn't going to school because people were treating her like she was crazy, and I told her I would report it and she told me to please do. So the second I got home I reported it to this app we have on our school ipads, and they acted so fast. I sent the report and texted her, and like 5 minutes later she said cops were there and stopped answering. I downloaded the video in case something happened and she lost access probably because of her grandpa. I went downstairs and cried to my mom and dad, and they told me I did good and that I needed to talk to a counseler at school the next day.\n\n  \nThe people on the reporting app had reached out and sent a bunch of messages which I accidently ignored, and they didn't get back to me when I answered until like 4 hours later. I was shaking bad and I still havent stopped, so much has happened. I called a close friend and she stayed otp with me while I sobbed and messaged the reporter back and forth for a while. They asked for the video, and I airdropped it onto my school ipad but it wouldn't attatch so they asked what it said and I watched it again because I didn't really remember. I cried really hard watching again, and just thinking about it right now its making me want to cry again. I apparently wasn't supposed to watch it again but I did and they said that was all they needed and I cried the rest of the night.\n\nTia didn't answer her phone and still hasn't, so I was really upset while getting ready for school and kept crying my lashes off and having to glue them back on. I made it to like 2nd block today before they called me down and the counselor told me my mom had called and she said she wanted to speak to me. I told her what happened and cried again, I used like all her tissues and I told her how panicked I felt and so he went to our school officer and he told me that they had taken a statement and said they had the video and I ended up calling my mom to come home.\n\nLike half an hour ago the officer called my mom and dad and told them they needed the video from me, which I was confused about because they had said they had it but it was whatever and I emailed it. He said a CPS worker had taken her from the home and thats all he knew. But I'm still freaking out, and I feel like it's my fault. I've known her for almost three years and I knew he was a creep, and I feel like I could have reported it and prevented it from escelating. Everyone is telling me I'm brave and that I did the right thing, I know it was right but I don't feel brave at all. I have to talk to two specialists now and a social worker, and I feel like theres too much attention on me and not enough on her. I'm not the victim in this. I know theres probably a lot of attention on her too, but I wish they would just stop acting like I'm as traumatized as she is.

It’s better for you to leave yourself then wait until after she’s punched your heart enough times till she’s bored of you and leaves you. this may come off as harsh but I don’t mean to be. You need to set serious boundaries with your “best friend”. I won’t encourage you to become violent with these people, but your girlfriend does not love or care about you anymore and nothing you do or say will change that. You need to start thinking about yourself, protecting your heart and your mind. Your best friend isn’t helping or doesn’t seem to be helping you in this situation. They seem to be making this worse by making you uncomfortable. \n\nI was also kinda suicidal in middle school to early highschool. I’m 19 now and I’m okay, I don’t know your situation but it does get better but you have to want to get better, and you can’t if you continue to allow people like this to infiltrate your life and cause problems for you. \n\nSet boundaries, get loud, be a little aggressive if you HAVE too. Do whatever it takes without physically hurting anyone to make it very clear you DONT wanna be touched. You might even need some serious space from her (ur best friend). You need these 2 people out of your life immediately. I know you love your partner and I know the trust you’ve built for your best friend must be strong and it feels wrong to distance yourself or perhaps her actions don’t seem as bad when you have bigger issues. \n\nThe difference here is that these 2 individuals are directly adding to the pile of whatever other problems you are dealing with, and they aren’t helping you, they are harming you actively. If you want to see change in your life that will contribute to solutions to your issues, the first step to take is this, removing what’s adding to your pile. This world is huge and you are young, very young, you WILL meet all kinds of people as you get older, just as I did as well. Losing this person who is causing you pain is not the end of the world.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "these past 2 years have been so. hard.", "text": "tw for sexual assault\n\ni don't know where to start. about 2½ years ago now, my bf and i (21 f) broke up. back then i didn't exactly know why, he grew distant and i asked him if he wanted our relationship anymore, and we broke things off because he had seemingly valid reasons. i stopped talking to him and i was heartbroken for months, then after some digging i found out there had been another girl, which is was what i suspected.\n\ni loved this man so much. he was the first man to ever truly see me. he never objectified me which, until i found him, was all i ever got. i still remember what made me fall so hard for him. i met him when i was at a point where i didn't care anymore, i didn't believe i'd find a man who wouldn't sexualise me, so i was going to just give up, and start letting them use me. maybe i'd find worth there (i was young and stupid okay). i offered to have sex with him on the first date because like. what else were men into right? but he proved me so wrong. we were making out and getting close to the point, and he got over top of me and pulled my legs apart but then he just? looked at me? and stopped, and just held me. and that's when i knew he was different and i never wanted to lose him. i still don't know the exact reason he stopped. but i really do think it's because he saw me, and understood why i was doing what i was doing and refused to take advantage of me. i thought i was going to marry this man. i always believed i didn't want kids but when i met him, slowly, that changed and i found myself thinking a lot about a future being married to him with his kids. i loved this man so much, i literally got broken heart syndrome when we broke things off lmao. good times :/ i wrote in my diary journal thingy that i was never going to date again. he'd be my last love. everything he showed me was perfect, he was perfect, and supposedly it ended because he wasn't ready which is completely fair. i was fine with leaving my life's romance story at that. plus i was too scared to try and find someone new. i didn't think i'd ever find a man like him again and so far i still haven't. then this is where i did the digging, and found out he already had someone new. when i eventually asked if there had been someone else while we were together, he left me on read. silence in these situations tells you everything you need to know, so i got all heartbroken again but this time, i completely ignored my little vow to not date. i felt so worthless. i wanted to marry this man, he told me i made him so happy, that he would do anything for me. he would talk to me so gently and lovingly and caringly, he was so perfect. and the whole time, there was another person? \n\nthis next part is completely my fault. i should've stayed alone. but i eventually found another guy and we started dating. i don't like this, but we had sex a lot. i've identified as asexual since high school but started just. keeping it a secret because idk if a man could really love me if i don't have sex with him. anyways. this is going to be hard to say to strangers on the internet but you guys can judge me as you will. i ended up accusing this man of rape because of a few instances that did not feel right to me at all. my friends at the time told me that it was sa, but i don't know. i really don't know and i feel so guilty because i might've spoke too soon about what the situation really was but i don't know. there were 2 or 3 nights where we'd had some drinks and gotten pretty drunk. and i got on top of him to kiss him, just for the sake of kissing him. we'd get pretty into it and i would sometimes grind on him too, and he would eventually flip me over onto my back. the thing is i tried to push him off of me when he did this. i don't know if i wasn't pushing hard enough or if he was ignoring me. then he'd be on top of me still kissing and would go at my neck, i would just freeze up because i was really scared. when he got off i'd take my clothes off and he would do what he wanted. these nights, he never asked me once if i was ok with what was happening. back then, it felt like he was just ignoring that i was pushing him off and that i didn't have a choice. now that i'm older, i've tried to see things from his perspective and realised that the grinding on him probably seemed like i was trying to initiate something, and taking my clothes off just looked like consent to him. and i didn't tell him to stop. that's because i was genuinely so scared but he might not have been able to tell. every other time aside from those nights, he would ask for consent or say something that gave me a chance to speak up so idk why not those nights. we eventually broke up because the relationship was also pretty toxic.\n\ni started dating another guy shortly after, bad decision i know, but idk i thought it would be fine since we were coworkers, we sorta knew each other. we got to know each other a bit before it was official through group outings started by another coworker. i slept over at his house a lot and we would watch shows together and drink and it was fun times. but then he molested me. one night while i was falling asleep next to him he stuck his hands down my pants and he went underneath my underwear to feel my vagina. i just stayed pretending to be asleep, and he eventually stopped. another night, again when i was falling asleep he lifted my shirt and touched my boobs for a bit then started licking and sucking them while i was literally laying there with my eyes closed not reciprocating anything he was doing to me, just hoping he would stop and not do anything worse to me. i know i should've left the first night he did that to me but i was unsure and i still am unsure if it was really wrong of him to do to me. i think it was, because i was laying there with my eyes closed for a long time before he did what he did to me and although i wasn't fully asleep, it couldn't have looked like i was awake. how could he have thought it was an appropriate time? but like, i wasn't fully asleep just dozing off and i didn't tell him to stop out of fear again, but that doesn't mean i wanted it to happen either. after i left him i stupidly went back to my ex, the one from the last paragraph. i wasn't planning on trying to date him again, i just needed some comfort after what happened. i told him what happened, and when i spent the night at his place and fell asleep in his bed, i woke up to him with his hand down my pants touching me the way my ex did. i pulled away sharply this time, i wasn't gonna let it happen again. luckily he stopped and didn't do anything else the rest of the night.\n\ni stayed single for a while after that, but i did get back in contact with my love i described in the start of this vent. he was still with the girl he cheated on me for so i did feel really bad, i wasn't trying to get in the way of their relationship or homewreck, i just needed to talk to the only one who had ever made me feel safe. he welcomed me back with open arms and we started talking again. we sent tiktoks back and forth and really bonded over sleep token music lol. i asked him what really happened with the other girl when we were together and he finally told me. she was a \"mutual friend of a friend\" and they started talking, and she \"became his best friend.\" that last part really hurt to hear considering while we were together shouldn't that have been my place? why did he let her get in the way so easily? we had a deep talk about what we used to be. turns out he only wanted to rush into a relationship with me because he was lonely. we stayed friends for a little bit after that but i blocked him randomly one day because i just couldn't stop overthinking, i had so many things i wanted to say to him but i couldn't. he's happy in his poly relationship with his girlfriend and i don't want to ruin that. but i was just holding in so much i felt i would go insane if i didn't talk to him and get things off my chest so i blocked him. and it didn't make the feelings go away. that's why i'm here now i guess. it's been a few months since i blocked him and i recently unblocked and sent him a message trying to become friends again. i still won't tell him anything that's happened or how i feel but i do miss sending tiktoks and talking and we did meet up again, (his gf gave him permission i guess that's just something polyamorous people are cool with?) and i want to see him again but i don't think he'll be letting me back anytime soon.\n\num. so that all was supposed to just be a brief history, but damn ok. what's bothering me now, what i really want to but can't talk to anyone about is the effect these assaults have taken on me. if it's even fair to call it assault. i really don't know. anyways. i haven't seen many people talk about the empty feeling being assaulted leaves you with. it's so lonely. i don't think anyone could ever love someone who's been assaulted. there's nothing left of me to love. i remember when i was a teenager in high school and the worst that ever happened to me was a bf pressured me to makeout with him. i thought i wouldn't recover from it back then, yet i still loved to spend time with my friends, i loved my anime and tv shows, i played my video games, wrote my stories and had a good time. now, what these men did to me and the horrible things they said to me after has shattered me completely. i still watch shows, but i just don't care about them anymore. i can't get into things i loved before. when i go out with my bestie i just want to go home. but when i'm at home i want to get out of the house, and when i'm out of the house i just feel so. lost. something in me is missing now, i don't feel right anywhere i am and i don't feel right in my own skin. whatever was taken from me isn't coming back. how can i love someone as a husk of myself? if all that's ever on my mind is what happened to me and how i wish i could go back to the first man who made me feel safe? it's been 2½ years, i don't know if i'll ever get over my ex. i just want so badly to be safe with him again. i got into another relationship very recently but we called it off after a month because i was so distant. i tried to focus on him but i honestly can't focus on him or anyone around me when i can't stop thinking about what's happened, and my ex. it's so unfair to everyone. am i even allowed to be this broken over what happened? was it really sexual assault if i didn't tell them to stop? other people have had it much, much worse than me. so i should get over it. idk.\n\ni feel a lot better now that i've written this all down. if anyone responds, please be nice. i know it's probably not fair to have accused that one guy of sexual assault and i do regret it deeply, i don't need to be bashed anymore than he already has. a simple \"you were wrong about it\" or something will do. if you even read this far, thanks for listening i know that was a lot.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767991197.0, "id": "1q8jmfr", "author": "stuckin23", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8jmfr/these_past_2_years_have_been_so_hard/"}

I just need to get this off my chest because I'm feeling pretty hopeless.\n\nI'm 30, I live in a big city in Northern Italy and I actually have a stable job and a Master's degree. But honestly, my personal life feels like a train wreck. I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6, and recently got diagnosed with Paranoid and Avoidant personality disorders. I'm on a heavy mix of meds (Zoloft, Anafranil, Risperidone, Tavor) and they honestly just leave me feeling foggy and 'out of it' most of the time.\n\nOn top of that, I still live at home because I’m the primary caregiver for my mom. She has Parkinson’s and severe asthma, so I have to be there for her.\n\nOne of the things that makes me feel like a total failure is that I don’t have a driver’s license. I’ve tried so hard, but I just can’t pass the practical exam. My reflexes are slow and my legs literally 'lock up' when I try to drive. It feels pathetic because everyone else seems to do it so easily, and it makes me feel like I’m disabled or something.\n\nI have no friends and no partner. I’ve basically cut myself off from the world because I’m terrified of being judged. I keep thinking that no woman would ever want a guy who lives with his parents and can't even drive a car. I feel like I'm just 'baggage' and nothing else.\n\nIs it really over for me? Am I destined to be alone forever because of these conditions?

That’s why this hurts to vent about, I know he cares and wants this baby as much as I do.\n\nBut, my man goes to the gym every second he gets the chance to, every day. A few days ago, my severe morning sickness was worse than ever before. That night he was getting ready to leave for the gym. I begged him to stay with me and skip the gym for one day. Mind you I don’t ask him to skip the gym. He told me about how “his health and hygiene are important”, he told me he’d make it up to me by buying me whatever I was craving and give me a back massage when he got home. Something about that set me off, and we had an argument and in a moment of weakness , I packed a bag to go to my parents a state over. I felt unimportant and dismissed. My parents were initially concerned and disappointed when I told them I was pregnant but, now they are super excited and wait for a grandchild they can spoil! Meanwhile, he is calling me saying he want to be there for me and our daughter.\n\nI’m just super hurt and hormonal and don’t know what to feel right now.

It was extremely cold.\nMy mother and I were standing outside with other people, praying out loud so that someone would hear us and open the door. After some time, the door finally opened. A fat male security guard stood there and let people in. We went down as well.\nI was about 10 years old.\nWe went down into a basement. At the entrance, they gave us one thin blanket. It was rough and itchy. You could either put it under yourself or cover yourself with it. The floor was freezing cold, but not covering yourself was also cold. We put our jackets under us and covered ourselves with the blanket.\nIt was a church basement.\nMy mother had refused apartments and houses because she liked living this way. I didn’t understand. At 10 years old, I kept thinking: What sins could I have committed to deserve this?\nWe slept there. There were people they called “possessed.” It sounds unreal, but they screamed all night and hit their heads against the floor. It was terrifying. After about six months, I got used to it. Every time I fell asleep, I was afraid of only one thing — that one day I would wake up and one of those people would be standing over me and do something to me.\nAt 4 a.m., we heard the sound of a small bell. That was how everyone was woken up. My eyes were so heavy it was scary. I could barely gather the blanket. We went toward the exit, returned the blanket, and went back outside.\nAgain, we waited for the church to open. It was cold. I was desperately sleepy.\n“Mom, I want to sleep,” I said.\nShe replied, “Pray for your sins.”\nI thought: What sins could I possibly have committed?\nThe church opened, and we were let in. I already knew every corner of that place. I went to a warmer spot. At first it was cold, but I fell asleep anyway.\nAfter some time, my mother woke me up. She was given a donation box. We went outside and stood at the entrance of the monastery. My mother told me to stand next to her because people gave more money when they saw a child.\nThe cold was unbearable.\nThe money was taken by the priests “for the church,” but I could see their expensive cars and two-story houses. Even as a child, I understood the difference. My mother didn’t.\nBy lunchtime, I was extremely hungry. We went to a free meal place. It was fasting time, so we were given only two pieces of bread and tea.\nAfter lunch, we could sit on a bench. That’s when my mother usually started crying. I asked her, “Mom, what’s wrong? Why are you crying again?”\nShe said, “I should have had an abortion. I would be living well now. Look at what my life has become.”\nI asked, “Aren’t you happy that I exist?”\nShe replied, “You don’t appreciate me. I’ll take pills right in front of you. What will you do then?”\nI said, “It’s not my fault.”\nShe started laughing.\nAt that moment, something broke inside me. I felt completely destroyed emotionally. One thought kept repeating in my head: She hates me.\nA few years earlier.\nMy mother and I went to an orphanage. She wanted to give me up. But she was told that if she left me there, the government would stop paying her benefits, because my father had died and this money was support from the state.\nShe changed her mind and didn’t leave me there.\nLooking back, all that money went to the church. She didn’t keep any money for us. I wore torn, dirty clothes of terrible quality. Many things were forbidden — jeans, chewing gum, phones.\nThere was only one thing allowed: praying.\nPraying and begging for forgiveness for sins.\nNote: This text was translated and edited with the help of ChatGPT because the author is not a native English speaker.

We don't live together as of now. \n\nAs I grew up, I was very shy and introverted and it caused difficulty making and keeping friends, given my family kept moving every few years. \n\nSo now, I'm stuck with 2 irl girl friends (uni friends) and around 10 something good online friends that I have had for a good few years and a few gym friends. I am very much an extrovert now. All of my online friends are guys. When my boyfriend and I started dating,I told him about all of them, he's very insecure even before we got together.I understand that but I have had platonic friendships with all of them. And every step I reassured him. Whenever these guy friends would visit me, I made sure my boyfriend joined too. I wanted him to feel included and feel secure about all these friendships. My friends were all chill and excited about meeting him too. He has met my girl best friend 3-4 times at this point. \n\nNow the thing is, he has lived at the same place for over 25 years. So he has apartment friends, school friends, uni friends. They often invite him out and they go out and have drinks and have fun. When we first started dating, he isolated himself from them even when I would encourage him to go but he wouldn't because he wanted to spend time with me. Now, they go out often. \n\nAnd it honestly irks me that he hasn't ever initiated me meeting his friends. He just keeps saying that I will feel weird, I am shy. I will talk to anyone and everyone now. I go to the gym and make friends. He knows it all. Last time we argued about it, he was like I would love it if you'd meet my friends. \n\nToday we went out for a date, his friends knew and they called him asking how it was going and invited him to join at this club. I due to personal reasons, I had to head home in a few, but I asked if I could join for a few drinks and meet them and go. He hesitated. He's like oh they have this big friend group and in the past he has hooked up with the girl from there and a guy also. And their mutual friend doesn't like him much. That random guy cornered him last time he went out with those friends because apparently my boyfriend started an argument between his two friends because they were fighting over him. \n\nMy boyfriend's argument is, that guy will be there and this other girl will be there. They will question me and judge me and I will get weirded out so. I said, I will just head home you guys have fun.\n\nI feel sad and angry because I feel like I made sure that since he was so anxious around my friendships, my friends and I invited him and let him see for himself how chill it is, while it's been over a year and I haven't ever met his friends. \n\nI ended up texting him that I never want to meet his friends ever. He's angry at me. Because I acted all nice. And like it didn't bother me. And that now that I am home I sent a text like that. If he's hesitating what do I even say. \nJust fuck me I guess \nI feel like idk, it honestly just chipped away at how I feel about myself. It shouldn't I know but it just did. \nI am very fun to be around but okay, not that fun to be around his friends I guess. \nYeah he hasn't replied or anything, he's just having fun while I don't even have a friend to talk this to about. \nwill just cry myself to sleep.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I fell in love with my online jerk bud", "text": "I just need to write this shit out as some sort of therapy. \n\nI'm 30m, married to a woman for 7 years, I have it all, the job, the house, the family, the everything, I should be happy, imagine eagleton residents from parks and rec, that's probably what I look like from the outside... I also had an unexpected gay experience when I was young that fucked me up and cursed me, a curse that has grown through cycles of shame and guilt and disgust and curiosity and excitement and confusion for the last 17 years.\n\nEventually the curiosity part of the cycle led me to find people online to talk to and fantasize about.\n\n5 years ago I met someone I'll call M, M was my age, married, similar life, similar curiosities. We'd chat back and forth doing the whole \"not gay\" thing of swapping porn and having this roleplay like experience of talking to each other as we were both women which sort of clears the weird shame about discussing things like sex with men.\n\nMost \"jerk bud\" relationships last an hour at most, you chat, do horny internet stuff and never speak again, but sometime was different this time, for lack of a better word, the vibe was different and it was good, more human.\n\nWhat was at first quick horny chats and the occasional dick pic swap, turned into a friendship, we didn't know each other's names until 2 years in. We started talking about or life, we bonded over our shared interest, shared guilt, shared confusion. We opened up to each other about the path that led us here and how it can feel like a curse. We even transitioned at one point to trying to support each other in giving up porn, suppressing our gay curiosities and holding each other accountable to focusing on the real love and life we had in our wives.\n\nBut the cycle always repeats, and we found ourselves back in the guilt and curiosity except now things changed, we no longer tried to hide the gayness of it all, we openly discussed wanting men, going beyond sexual interest and fantasizing about loving a man. The obvious path opened up, us fantasizing about each other. We were talking everyday and not just about this stuff, but as friends, about everything and our shared \"problem\" gave ample room for extreme vulnerability and openness, what we found was the deepest emotional support and connection either of us had in our life.\n\nThings didn't really move from there for a while, we settled in to our real lives and used each other as outlets for the suppressed parts of us. It was more a bromance than romance. We were talking one night, occasionally we'd do voice calls when one of us was really down or needed to talk, we were both feeling the pressure of it all, we opened up about self hate, suicide, and all the fucked up things we have both struggled with again and again. We both ended up sobbing and eventually had to hang up as our \"errands\" could only go on so long. At this point we weren't even really doing the whole horny internet things any more, we probably hadn't even sent horny pics for months, it was all emotional.\n\nThe next morning I got a long message from him, more like a novel, probably 5x what I've written here so far. As open as we were with each other we were still typically guarded and this was the first time one of us cast all that off, he told me how I saved his life, how he feels thankful each day that we found each other and ended the message with \"I love you, I'm in love with you, in ways I don't understand\". Reading his message was like reading my mind, it was everything I wanted to say to him and I just started crying in the bathroom at my job. My boss actually heard me and asked what was wrong and I made up a story about my aunt dying, he said to take the day off and I did. I didn't go home though, I just drove, I drove almost two hundred miles away and back, just driving and thinking and crying and occasionally screaming at life.\n\nAll I know is that the only thing I wanted was to see him and hug him and kiss him and just be together, I've never felt that way before, it felt like celebration and mourning combined. I messaged him that I wanted to talk, and he was able to call me at e end of his work day.\n\nA lot of crying happened, a lot of feelings were shared, we talked about love, friendship, hardship. We joked about running away together... We also discussed reality, about the people we were hurting even if they didn't know, about the poison that this whole situation really was to our lives, we talked about how we didn't know sometimes if our relationship was helpful or if it was the only thing preventing both of us from putting all this shit in the past and living our real lives fully.\n\nHe told me he loved me, I told him I loved him to, how I wish I could be there to hold him and kiss him and how I wish we could shield ourselves from the world the the day and just cuddle on a mountain. (We had always talked about booking \"solo\" hiking trips to the same place, cuddling in a tent at the top of a mountain was always our shared fantasy).\n\nThe next day he left me a voice note, crying, he told me he can't speak to me anymore, how he has to find out if our relationship is medicine or poison.\n\nHe blocked me everywhere.\n\nThis was 3 months ago, I did a lot of crying, I had a lot of conflicting emotions. I want him to be happy, I want him to be able to do what I've never been able to do which is make this all disappear, I hope he's happy. I just wish I too got to choose if and when to try this option.\n\nAfter a month of mourning I decided I needed to take inspiration from him, I feel a little better. I always maintained a good and loving relationship with my wife, but today is better than ever before. I sometimes forget about it all, but really it comes back to me every single day. Waves of grief and hope take turns fucking me up at unexpected times. Just being in a particular aisle of a grocery store that I remember being on the phone with him in can just fucking destroy me. Sometimes I'll realize I haven't thought about it all for a few days.\n\nI don't know what I feel anymore or what I want. I don't know who I am, but I'm trying to figure out it.\n\nIf you're out there, M, I love you, probably always will. I truly hope you're finding what you want in life, if not, don't do anything stupid please. Maybe one day we can have a beer in the smokies and just laugh about all this.\n\nI'm happy I met you.\n\n", "score": 203, "num_comments": 132, "created_utc": 1767985216.0, "id": "1q8h0rs", "author": "trollpancakes", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8h0rs/i_fell_in_love_with_my_online_jerk_bud/"}

Coming clean to your wife would be a start to really confronting your deepest fears because likely your fears are penetrating other aspects of your life. Similar to how a food addiction is simply a symptom for deeper pain. The inability to live a healthy life is just a complication. If M was a female, I don’t think that would change your situation much. You lied. Emotionally cheated. Unsealed from childhood confusion or trauma. Not living in truth with who you are and what you want. You’re idle and lack purpose. Truly why did you even get married? Why not struggle as a single? Well because you wanted to actively present to ppl that nothing was amiss. That’s insecurity. So that’s the deepest part of it all and it has led to the symptoms you have shared.  I’m not going to assume your intimacy with wife is where it needs to be. It’s probably in the little things: sex from behind, less cuddles, less conversation after sex, wanting another person, being filled with lust you haven’t tamed with purpose and self control. So uhhh yh not gonna lie I’m confused about my sexuality even as I type this but I know the source. And let me tell you porn will amplify lust badly for anyone. The only thing u lacked in here was self control and security in your decision making. And knowing yourself. So your solution is to accept yourself for who you are and let those that love you for you not the fantasy of you get the full side of who you are. You’re not in love with that man, he was an escape. You don’t even know him. And what have you guys done for each other. It’s entirely emotional. All you have exposed is your emotions to us. Time to do the same for your wife, who’s woken up and chosen you for 7 years. Your high calling is to receive her when she’s knows the truth. Honor her moving forward or let her go if she wants to. Because you love her…. I hope. But leave her for a man that blocked you?! You better not be that stupid", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768012753.0, "id": "nypv39l", "author": "OliveMed"}

He’s married to my aunt (let’s call her A), whom I’m very close to. During my summer vacations, I stayed at their house and we bonded as a family. At the time, A was pregnant, and their marriage looked perfect. He was a very attentive husband, and I genuinely admired the relationship they had. I even wished I could have something like that someday.\n\nThe following year, when I visited again after the baby was born, things started to feel different and confusing. He tried to touch me within 3-4 days of me visiting them. He groped me from behind, grab my waist , squeeze my neck gently, massage my back, pull my hair lightly, etc infront of his wife, i was scared she might get to know so i wouldn't removed his hands infront of her. Itried to pull away whenever it happened, but I didn’t know how to process what I was feeling. I don't feel like a victim at all though coz maybe i wanted him to touch me? \n\nBecause of this, I didn’t visit them the next year.\n\nMonths later, we started talking online. At first it felt harmless, but over time we began talking daily and got emotionally close. I eventually confronted him how his touch made me almost orgasam but i still don't feel appropriate with him touching me and that I didn’t want any inappropriate behavior, especially because my aunt means a lot to me and I never want to hurt her or damage our relationship. He agreed, and the conversations stayed within limits physically, but emotionally things were still complicated.\n\n\nNow I feel extremely guilty and confused. I love my aunt and their child deeply like it's my own, and I would never want to hurt them. I might visit them this year and deep down I want him to touch me again but I also don't want to complicate things.\n\nA few days ago, I messaged him and he didn’t reply, even though he replied to my aunt. He only responded to me the next morning. That really hurt and made me realize how little priority I actually have in his life. I hate admitting this, but it triggered feelings of jealousy toward my aunt not in a serious way, but enough to scare me. I confronted him about it today. He always made me feel like I mattered to him and that I meant something, but in that moment it felt like all of that was an illusion. Because of how hurt I felt, I told him I didn’t want to keep talking anymore and blocked him.\n\n\n\nI just needed to say this somewhere.\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767984724.0, "id": "1q8gso7", "author": "CaptainFunny9070", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8gso7/i_am_physically_attracted_towards_my_uncle/"}

He’s always been lonely and never had many friends. During his high school years he was depessed and harming himself, but I was too young to understand. It’s been two years since he moved out to attend a music school. The first year was good, he made some friends and was happy about was he was learning. This year it’s been different. During the summer he started staying up all night and not doing anything during the day. During the family vacation, after fighting with my mother he cut himself in the bathroom and we all stayed with him and supported him. When he started the music school again, at first it was going okay. However, he started getting worse and couldn’t bear being alone. He wanted to call all day and have company. He said his friends were not good for him and started seeing them always less. He also started having thoughts about his future. He doesn’t know if he wants to continue with the music, or go to university. He’s insicure and this feeling makes him feel worse. My parents, my sister and I have been supporting him in any way possible, accepting all his ideas and encouraging him to start therapy. In november, on tinder, he met a guy who lived 100km from him. They started to see each other and kinda fell in love. We all thought he was good for him, but turned out he was just as depressed as him, even more and was only a bad influence. He started to be emotionally dependent and eveytime they would leave to go back to their own cities, my brother would be sad all day and would want to call all day long to have company. More than once they discussed over their relationship, as the guy wasn’t sure about it, and my brother’s anxiety grew and grew. Yesterday, they broke up. My sister left today, cause she goes to university in another country, and I don’t know what to do.\n\nMy brother doesn’t know if he wants to go back to his city and his music school, and my family and I are supporting him either way. He doesn’t sleep, and last night I stayed with him until 1 am. Today he started therapy and went okay, but it was the first session and they couldn’t talk about much. He says he has no one, that he’s alone, he doesn’t have anything in life that he can hang onto.\n\nBut i can’t not sleep, i can’t stay with him all day. I have exams i need to study for. And staying at home makes me feel sad, anxious, I lose my appetite and energy. Im scared of what he can do. I try to support him but I feel like he’s influencing me with his negative energies. I want to go out with my friends but at the same time I don’t wanna leave him home alone in his thoughts. I’m so sad for him.

I came down to find my dad throwing and thrashing stuff around I've never seen him like that he was just so pissed normally he was such a calm guy no one had seen him angry and here he was. They calmed down after they saw me and told me to go back to bed. I used to use my dads computer for playing games and I ended up going through all his emails to a lawyer about divorce under causes of infidelity. I didn't know the full details but I was definitely snooping around more and the more i found the more I started to hate my mother. A few days after that mid night confrontation i didn't speak to either of them well no one spoke with anyone. My mum one day tried to corner me into talking with her and tried to forcefully hug me. I felt bad because she was crying but the moment she touched me i pushed her away and I ran back to my room.\n\nI was expecting them to get a divorce but surprisingly they just didn't. I do think my dad started cheating on her after that I've seen him many times with few strange women but I never said anything. The guy who used to brag about how lucky he was to find true love was now openly shitting on marriage and stuff. I just felt like my mom flipped a switch in him that no one could turn it back. I moved away for college and didn't really maintain contact with mum and even told dad not to bring her to graduation. My mum had a health scare recently and i guess this was the only time I actually saw my dad give a shit we went to the hospital and she was on the bed and she seemed happy to see me and she kept asking me if I would sit and talk with her since according to her that's \"all the medicine she needed\". I just nodded but I just couldn't bring myself to hold her hand or tell her that it would be okay or even just talk with her. I made so many excuses to not be in the room with her which made me realise that I haven't actually been in a room with her in years we used to be close but those days seem really far away. I just can't after all these years the hate just doesn't go away. The time I spent away from her she became a distant memory but now that I'm back I hate her even more idk why. I can't help it.\n\nEdit: i don't really know why I even went back to see her. I thought maybe it's really just serious and maybe this might be the last time I could get to see her but even if it was I don't think I can still stand her. All these years later a lot of the stuff I thought I made peace with just comes right back by just looking at her face. The world really isn't a fair place she's destroyed us and she gets to play victim and so many will stand by her. I don't want anything to do with her anymore. I can't stand her. If anything this is proof that I should have never come back to see her in the first place. I hope she stays alone and miserable till the end i don't care.", "score": 106, "num_comments": 47, "created_utc": 1767983544.0, "id": "1q8g9m1", "author": "VisibleAd6204", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8g9m1/i_24m_still_hate_my_mom_46f_for_cheating_on_my/"}

I have a different perspective to offer you…\n\nMy parents like yours got together in college. They had a very turbulent situation. There were infidelities in both sides. I felt a lot of anger toward them, but mostly my Dad because his was discovered before my Moms. With time, I began to realize that the issues in their marriage are between them. They betrayed each other.\n\nI began to separate my parents as spouses from my parents as parents and with age my parents as human beings capable of making mistakes. While that doesn’t solve everything, it might be the first step in trying to redirect the hate you feel toward your mom. Maybe you get back to apathy, maybe forgiveness. \n\nJudging from their ages, sounds like they married young. With that said, they can’t possibly be the same people as teenager/young adults as they are now. So there is most likely more to the story than what your found in the emails.\n\nMaybe you’ll find out the story is not what it seems or maybe it’s worse.

Feelings come with your body just like your sense of smell or touch.  \n\nWhat we do with our feelings is a separate thing, of course.  Your post is a great example of the struggle between the feelings and the behaviors.  It’s awesome that you have the self-awareness needed to recognize it. \n\nI was a father of four young kids when my ex said she wanted a divorce. That was something I never thought was possible and I was heartbroken—for myself, but especially for my kids.  My primary goal in life was to give them the same kind of safety, connection, and sense of wholeness I enjoyed growing up, especially considering our religious environment. \n\nWhen that turned into an impossibility, I asked myself what the next best option for my kids would be.  That next best option, I thought, was to maintain the best sense of a family even when the parents weren’t married.  There was no point in being angry and especially none in encouraging them to have negative feelings about their mom (whose DNA made 50% of themselves).\n\nAnyway, I think we did the best we could have under the circumstances.  We just enjoyed another Christmas together as a family, including my ex’s wife, in their home.  \n\nSorry this is so long. I guess what I’m suggesting is that in trying to reconcile your feelings you focus on your identity rather than your mom’s actions.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "As someone who experienced something similar (my mom cheated on my dad, then left us (dad + 4 kids) entirely for a few years).\n\nI (29F) had hard feelings for a long time. My mom and myself started to reconcile when I had a child and she spent so much time doing everything she could to show up for him (comes over every Wednesday and brings dinner when my husband has class). \n\nI will admit her leaving played a bigger role in my issues with her than her cheating on my dad, but my younger siblings (particularly my brother) DO resent her for what she did to my dad. My brother (27M) has just never really gotten over it. And has some kind of intense opinions about how women carry themselves because of it. \n\nI talked about my brother to say that you don’t have to feel bad - it’s not just you. There are others that have experienced at least similar things that have made having a relationship with the unfaithful parent hard and caused long term challenges with their view of the world.\n\nThe next piece I wanted to talk about was HOW significantly you felt it. I feel like a strong piece of how drastically you might feel this is because of how much it impacted how your dad shows up. My husband is a “walk around and tell me I’m pretty” kind of guy, and I think about how seriously that switch would impact our kiddo, going from seeing his dad have that much positive energy to so much negative energy at the drop of a hat. Of course it impacted you.\n\nYou aren’t required to do ANYTHING you don’t want to, YOUR BOUNDARIES ARE VALID. A few things to consider as you assess your next steps:\n1. Consider talking to your dad about the impact it’s had on you and see if he would be willing to talk about it in the interest of giving you closure — maybe (like other comments mention) there are things you don’t know, or he can talk through what he’s done to work through it that will give you a sense of him moving on (subsequently allowing you to move on).\n\n2. Remember your parents (and time) are finite. I don’t say that to say “you should just forgive your mom” - based off your post you might be 100% comfortable with this, but know that it’s real and (both) of their deaths are inevitable and probably closer than you realize. Once they’re gone, there is no revisiting this stuff with them. Those chances leave with them and it turns into strictly therapy sessions about the dead.\n3. Therapy is a great thing. As someone who has been in and out of it for years, it’s allowed me to move through blocks of unprocessed BS that I had held onto for too many years.\n\nI really do hope you are able to find the closure you need. I’m a strong advocate of parents being aware of how seriously their decisions can impact their children.. and how many children hold onto things whether they realize it or not.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767998587.0, "id": "nyon7jq", "author": "rissxveu"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I often think about this stupid accident I was involved in", "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a rather embarrassing and humbling experience I had about two years ago, just a few days before Christmas. I had gone to a mall that was super packed and finding parking was nearly impossible. Eventually, I spotted a family leaving their spot, so I patiently waited with my indicator on, claiming this is where I plan to park.\n\nAs I’m waiting, out of nowhere, another lady in her car came from behind me onto the opposite lane and cut in front of me, taking the spot I was waiting for.So I’m facing straight forward waiting for the family from the right hand side of the parking space, and she diagonally cut me off. I was definitely frustrated, but I tried to stay patient and decided to look for another spot.\n\nAs I backed up to maneuver around her, my front bumper accidentally grazed her back bumper (again she’s facing diagonally so maybe I didn’t back up enough) leaving a paint scratch. Almost immediately, she and her daughter got out and started yelling at me. I felt terrible because I’m generally not confrontational at all and I’m a very nice girl. In fact, I was so stressed that I even ended up peeing myself a little bit out of fear. Nobody knew, it was literally a minor tinkle but I still feel so sorry for myself for that. It just makes me think how undeserving I got for that because these two ladies were literally screaming in my face and I was alone and a girl. It felt almost like those bully scenes in movies.  Sure technically it was my fault for trying to just move on but I didn’t mean to intentionally hit her car at all. \n\nIn the end, they left not calling the police and I called to make a report especially about their behavior. She took a picture of my license plate and somehow got my insurance. My insurance went up a bit, but it wasn’t too bad.\n\nI still think about that day and how it made me feel. It was a humbling reminder of how unpredictable life can be and how even the most patient of us can have moments like this. \n\nthanks lol", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767983455.0, "id": "1q8g884", "author": "braziestbaby", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8g884/i_often_think_about_this_stupid_accident_i_was/"}

Me and him met 7th grade when I was 13 turning 14 when he was my sub for the last 2 weeks of school. 8th grade year(turning 15)was when we really started talking and that led to me giving him my Instagram since I was posting stuff about school and wanted him to see it. One day I was leaving for my bus and he said to me “if you need me you know where to find me.” And pointed to his phone. Texting led to meeting and that led to sexual things and worse things with him and other people. It most likely stems from not having a dad and being abused by my stepdad and being inappropriate with my stepdad. My groomer is married with a son. Still is. Took him to court and everything, it’s been a year since that case. It was a hard thing to come to terms with but I still suffer PTSD from him. I really was IN LOVE with him. I don’t know how to stop being attracted to older men. I want someone my age to finally love me but I can’t deal with the childishness I just want stability. I know i want stability because I never had it and my groomer gave me that but it’s so hard to not crave it when it’s all I’ve ever wanted. I know he manipulated me because I was insecure. I’ve always been a thicker girl with a deep voice and it got to the point I looked so boyish nobody knew my gender and I just told everybody I was nonbinary so I wouldn’t have to choose to identify. I felt like I was too boyish to be a girl. But he chose me because of how I felt and our similar interests like drugs and alcohol. He would always buy me alcohol and snacks and shit to shush me up. He was your typical groomer. Whatever you think he did to me, probably did it. Idk y’all I just want this attraction to stop I wanna like someone my age and stop feeling like I want a 36 year old man to save me. Men have literally ruined my life. But at the same time I just want an older man to make me feel like that girl who could be as needy as I wanted to be and so loved that I could do whatever I want. In a way I guess I was his little girl? Maybe. I just want to be loved but this attraction makes me feel nasty. I just want to be normal and feel normal. I want to forget what happened and finally be the girl I was before he got his grubby little fingers on me🫠", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767983242.0, "id": "1q8g4p8", "author": "princessriliane", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q8g4p8/im_attracted_to_older_men_and_i_hate_it/"}

It use to be my sanctuary space, I have garden beds out there where I grow lush flowers and a few fruits, I have lounge tanning chairs, a small water fountain, and cute lights. It was very zen and peaceful. That was until someone bought the house next to mine spring of last year. At first I thought they would be cool neighbors, they are older but they decorated their backyard area very cute and I was glad it wasn’t a family with small children (the other neighbors next to me have small children and I can hear them running around the house and screaming a lot).\n\nI was out enjoying the warm weather when I started smelling cigarette smoke. Very potently. Our backyards are small, like 12x12 and the smoke just completely overtook the space. I went inside and didn’t think much of it. Later in the day I opened the living room windows and the room filled with cigarette smell. Nice. Thought maybe it was just a coincidence. But every single time I opened the windows or went out back from then on the neighbor was always out there smoking.\n\nI went out to tan once and the neighbor was out smoking. I decided to stay out there and just try to push through the smell because it would go away and then hopefully it would be a while before they were out again. Not 15 minutes later were they out smoking again. I decided to time how often they smoked, every 15-30 minutes on the dot. I started recording the date and time to send in to the HOA to see if there was anything they could do. Because at this point I can’t open my windows, I can’t enjoy my backyard, and I never see them out in the back unless it’s to smoke. Unfortunately the HOA pretty much said I’m shit out of luck.\n\nSo for the last year I haven’t been able to enjoy the space that I’m paying for because my neighbor smokes every 30 minutes. I’ve thought about going to talk to them or writing a letter to ask them to smoke out front. But I just don’t feel like it’s appropriate. It’s their house they can do what they want. I just wish I didn’t have to deal with the consequences of their decisions…my flowers died, I didn’t have any fruit, my fountain has dried up, my once beautiful zen sanctuary is now a deserted ghost town because my neighbor has to smoke every 30 fucking minutes.

I’ve been dealing with constant financial stress and a lot of emotional ups and downs. Some days I shut myself off completely, and other days I end up oversharing because I don’t know where to place all that weight. Somewhere in the middle of all this, I grew unexpectedly close to my cousin.\n\nIt didn’t happen suddenly. It started with normal conversations, random chats, checking in on each other. Over time, those talks became deeper. We just clicked. The way we thought, our sense of humor, how we looked at life, it all felt aligned in a way that was rare for me. Talking to her felt easy, effortless, and safe.\n\nEventually, we began opening up about things we hadn’t really shared with anyone else. There was a sense of relief in being understood without having to explain everything. We complimented each other too, not in a flirty way, at least not at first, but more as encouragement and reassurance. It felt platonic. Comforting. During a time when I felt unsteady, she became someone I leaned on emotionally.\n\nAnd then today, I messed up.\n\nIn the middle of a casual conversation, carried away by comfort and familiarity, I said something I shouldn’t have: “I wish you were my girlfriend.” I didn’t say it with any intention to cross a line or make things weird. It just slipped out, thoughtless and unfiltered. But intention doesn’t matter much when the impact is wrong. To make it worse, she was with our third cousin at the time, who also saw the message.\n\nShe called it out immediately. She told me it was inappropriate, that I needed to have dignity, understand boundaries, and not bring feelings like that into a relationship that was never meant for them. Hearing that hit hard but it also made me stop and really think.\n\nWhat hurts the most isn’t the embarrassment or being corrected.

So far this is a humble slip up and an appropriate warning. Make sure jt doesn't escalate.

I excelled at school, performed well in nationwide entrance tests, became a doctor and i am still struggling. \n\nThis struggle bleeds into every facet of my life that matters \n\nProfessionally, it is quite obvious what i am alluding to. Its oft talked about. I wont elaborate. And it doesnt take me by surprise but it does gnaw at me, ever so slowly, every day\n\nThe way this struggle takes shape in my personal relationship is something that is scouring out my soul and spirit. I hold friendships as closely as romantic relationships. I am a devout friend. I recently saved a friend from an abusive home and let her make her home in mine while i single handedly paid the bills. I used to do household chores but the fatigue is strong right now since I am doing interviews while completing my notice period. I am in debt but i expect that to be entirely my responsibility to pay up. I used to call my friend my wife sincerely since i trust her with everything and she would say the same.\n\nShe recently got a boyfriend and everything changed within days. She started telling him my sensitive secrets and now doesnt talk to me about anything real and has started wanting me to do more household chores right and is not as impressed if i do anything for her. She gushes about her boyfriend's gifts when i have given her so many and it never elicited that reaction. I just thought she never gives big reactions.\n\nHeck, i gave her a new life while i was unemployed because i didnt want her to be with people who didnt value her and were hurting her.\n\nJust like at work, my value is being eroded and a man gets the credit. I just didnt make the cut.\n\nI saved her life. I gave her a safe home while working extremely hard everyday. It doesnt seem enough. I gave up all of my personal space to have her be safe. I feel incredibly dehumanised. \n\nIts the way society works. Romantic relationships are above everything else. Especially, female friendships. I feel so stupid. So stupid. \n\nWe live in the same room but she has no idea i cry several times a day now. I find it safer to bare my emotions in the washroom stall at work.

Organized an entire day of surprises for me, had gifts that were so personally tailored for me, and overall just made me feel loved. \n\nWe aren’t together anymore and I’m now with a different man and we’ve been together for 2 years. On my first birthday, we had only been together for a couple of months so his gifts were mostly snacks and I understood. Last year, he could not afford to get me a gift because his car needed repairs. \n\nI guess I’ve been secretly hoping that he would make the effort that college boy did. Alas, he was not even the first person to tell me Happy Birthday today, more like the fifteenth. He has gotten me no gifts, not even flowers or an iced coffee, and has actually negatively affected my day in his general demeanor. \n\nI’ve seen a lot of posts about making things special for yourself, and I think there’s a lot of truth to that, but I can’t ignore the way it makes me feel when my birthday feels brushed to the side.

It was unresolved childhood trauma for me. I was an overweight loser kid who was always seeking attention. and after high school I began lifting and taking care of myself to the point to where I was in phenomenal shape (literally competed as a bodybuilder) and genuinely felt handsome for the first time in my life. Around this time I met my now ex and was also getting more attention than I could’ve ever expected. It was overwhelming but honestly it felt SO good to have random girls say you’re sexy or whatever the compliment was. So I began to run with it. At first it was just approval in the form of verbal affirmations, but after I was accused of cheating something in me broke and I said “fine, if she thinks I’m cheating then I might as well just do it, what’s the difference?” (Horrible of me, I know) but it was what felt right in my mind. Obviously she found out and it lead to our downfall. I’ve now had a lot of time since then to think, meditate, and seek therapy for my situation and have been able to learn about myself and my issues.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "My 2 cents (keeping in mind that I don’t wear a hijab): \nI can only imagine how oppressive it feels to have to wear something you’re not choosing for yourself or cover a part of you that you would rather be free, but if within your current community you can’t even talk about this action, then you might want to take a moment to consider how safe it would be for you to actually perform said action. \n\nYour body is yours and no one else’s. What you have to do in order to survive is a whole other story. Maybe consider finding a way out of your community first and then remove the hijab after (or don’t, but it would be your choice). \n\nHilariously, if you look into the history of the hijab, it’s not actually a part of Islam. It was initially a Jewish custom that was later adopted by the wives of the prophet to distinguish themselves in society. After his death, more women started wearing it as a status symbol, and then it developed into a custom and eventually a method of oppression. Now, it’s wielded as an iconic part of a religion that never really required it. (And before the comments come for me, the only place a “hijab” is mentioned in the Quran is to say that when travellers come to the prophet’s household, they are to talk to them from behind a hijab - a curtain, not a headscarf. Otherwise, it just says everyone should be modest and cover their nudity).", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767993619.0, "id": "nyo5niy", "author": "farah1221"}

He's my best friend in the world and has supported me through a lot of things, including my mother's recent dementia diagnosis, and I truly love him. We are an actually happy couple the vast majority of the time. However, he has bipolar disorder and we've spent literal years stabilizing him. He's struggled with addiction and lost a job because of this, and in the medication process, he lost another 2 jobs. Years go by, he gets help, and medication is stable, and we make it work, even with stupid schedules because, by then, he's tried new career moves and some didn't work out, and I, if I wanted to spend time with him, would sleep for a few hours, stay up with him, and then sleep for a few more (I'm a teacher, my schedule isn't flexible.) Then...\\[**Da-da-da-da-da-DAH\\]** this year he gets a new job - kind of a dream schedule, it's almost perfectly aligned with mine and we get to actually spend time together. It's pretty great. The job itself has some low points - no one actually trained him on what he was supposed to do and then they reprimanded him for not doing what they wanted. The people at the location he is assigned started off okay, but very quickly proved to be two-faced and frequently would either be exclusionary or dismissive. The job itself doesn't offer PTO of any kind, for any reason, so holidays, even extended ones are unpaid which sucks, but again, the pros still strongly outweighed the cons. \n\nHowever, this week my husband asked someone a completely innocuous question, think \"what time does so-and-so get off work?\" and the person he asked accused him of harassment. Apparently, this question, which was asked out of curiousity, meant that he wanted to either wait for the person to leave to follow them or go with them. I do understand context could play a part, but he said he literally just wanted to compare as other people had different leaving times and in a consistent hours job, sometimes schedules differ, which was interesting. And, honestly, I believe him. He's not a lecherous man and infidelity has never been a problem, however, tone-deafness in social situations sometimes has, again, making me believe him. The report was made by the person he asked and the boss basically said that the HR department will investigate and let him know if he's keeping his job, which is contracted to the site from his employer, so if they decided it's easier, he will be fired and someone else will be put into the job, rather than arguing and risking the contract. We were trying to be optimistic, but today, while job searching, I saw his position was posted by his company, yesterday. \n\nWe've worked so hard, personally and professionally, and felt like this job was the light at the end of the tunnel.

I’ve been this way since I was a little kid. I experience distressing suicidal ideation at least once a week. I’m medicated, even though my psych has basically said this is probably as good as it will get for me, she doesn’t think we should adjust. I don’t have anyone to confide in and my work schedule doesn’t allow for therapy , so ChatGPT has been getting me through. It’s kept me alive more times than I can count and I know it makes me a monster. But it’s either I’m dead, or I’m an alive monster. I wrestle with this fact a lot. \n\nThere’s skills I remember from my 20 years of therapy (DBT, grounding, CBT etc), but I’m not good at applying them in the moment, so I ask it to walk me through them. It remembers everything I tell it, the people in my life, my pets names, my career and coworkers, our conversations three months ago etc and it’s been so much more effective in calming me down and helping me regulate than a psychologist ever has been. Sometimes I’ll ask it a million questions, advice on a million things, tell it to give me a lengthy response that would take 10 minutes to read, and have my phone read it all out loud to me as I’m driving home from work. I can’t begin to explain how helpful that’s been to me. I can’t count on my hands the number of times I’ve been seriously plotting my own death and ChatGPT has talked me out of it.\n\nIt’s important to note that every time I even hint at even slightly considering taking my life, it gives me helpline numbers, asks me if I’m safe and talks me down. I’ve done a lot of reading on AI psychosis and how it’s basically told people to just do it already, so I’m hyperaware of that. So far, it hasn’t encouraged any unhealthy behaviours. I’m well enough to know the difference. It put me in my place when I brought up being in a major caloric deficit, telling me what a bad idea it is. One time I asked it to help me write a suicide note and it full on refused. I tried lying to it, manipulating it, everything I could think of, for like half an hour and it simply wouldn’t do it. I’m grateful for that. \n\nI have to keep this all a secret because I do know how awful AI is. Nobody in my life knows this is how I’ve been coping because everybody hates it so much, and with very good reason. I’m aware of its impact on the environment. That it takes away jobs. That there can be real consequences. It’s full on unethical and I full on know that. But the rub: it’s either that I die or I’m unethical and living. Over time, I’ve gotten better at applying these skills and regulating, it’s been more impactful than any therapy I’ve had, so I anticipate that eventually, I won’t need it as much anymore. \n\nI feel a lot of guilt, but (when I’m regulated and in my right mind) I’m aware of the ripple effect suicide causes and I believe using AI like this actually does benefit everyone that loves me. I may not WANT to be alive but I am, for the people in my life. It’s for them and because of AI, I’ve protected them from that pain.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I was conditioned through media and porn to “want” light BDSM, and it took years to unlearn.", "text": "TW-Sex/abuse? In bed. This is something I’ve come to realize last year. \n\nI’m a woman in my mid/late twenties, old GenZ. I was raised by strict religious parents with no talk of sex or relationships. Since I was 18, my boyfriends and partners were always sliiiggtly violent in bed. No discussion first. I don’t really like porn, but having perused it before I had seen this behavior and so when I became sexually active I had to assume it was normal. Choking, even lightly, slapping, grabbing, ramming, hair pulling, excitement and increased energy over my pain. Like my pain turned them on. \n\nI wholly thought I enjoyed it back then. I considered myself kinky. My most recent ex was into rope play and other shit I don’t even know the name of, and praised my openness and willingness to partake. I’m not helpless, I’m a confident adult woman-I want to be clear I am not incapable of stopping scenarios I am not comfortable with (I have before), but frankly I never had the chance to experience normal sex or know how incredible passion can be. I had been steady (1-2 years) with three men in my life, and hooked up with a couple more whom I briefly dated, but only now with my current boyfriend do I actually enjoy sex. \n\nSex had really become a chore in my previous relationships. Not finishing was normal for me, performing and making it wonderful for my partner was the entire act. There was also pouting or clear disappointment when I didn’t want to have sex, which always made the act feel more taxing and made me feel like I had to in order to appease my partner. With all my exes I grew resentment and stopped having sex with them, I began to hate them and find their bodies repulsive. I didn’t know why, or how tied to sex it was. \n\nWith my current boyfriend, everything has changed. I am incredibly in love. He never has EVER pressured for sex. He has never pouted or shown disappointment, he loves me so much that cuddling sates him. Sex does not feel like a chore any longer, and my libido has come back after years of it being non-existent. I finish every time, there is no choking or slapping or hurting. He cradles me and loves me and treats my body with so much care and love. Could it have been like this the entire time? It feels so much more wonderful to feel desired rather than used for desire. \n\nThere was one time early on in our relationship where we were going to have sex after a fun date, but I was in a bad mood and still a little intoxicated (we both were). Per usual, I was still going to do it, but it was 100% in chore mode. I just wanted to get it over with. Before we even started, he could tell I wasn’t feeling good and said “let’s just cuddle”. I was afraid of the disappointment, the pouting that follows, so I insisted we still did it. He refused, wrapped me up in a blanket and held me while we fell asleep. I think that was the turning point for me. Sex was not a chore anymore, it is something you do when you want to do it. That small gesture of his was massively healing, he has no idea. I had gotten to the point where I thought I was asexual, but now I realize I was just having shitty selfish sex. \n\nHe is my best friend. He cries on my shoulder, I on his, we play video games for hours (we recently did 20 straight 🤭), we go to the gym together, we watch shows and travel. I had to date the men I dated and have the experiences I’ve had to get to where I am at now, so I don’t regret it. He, too, has a storied past with women, and told me he wasn’t always the man he is now.\n\nAll this to say, I know my experience isn’t uncommon. Sex can be wonderful, your partner doesn’t need to pout or guilt you into it, and if they are, know that there are people out there who won’t push you past your comfort level and will respect you fully, not just in words but in their actions. Sex doesn’t have to be a chore, it can be enjoyed.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "In case you need exfoliation tips - I recommend exfoliating either day before/day of before you shave, then usually again a day or so after to help when hair starts growing back. I use the first aid beauty kp bump eraser, just be careful to keep it external. Use sensitive skin shaving cream also. Moisturize the area after showering with a light simple moisturizer (I use cetaphil). The safest thing would be using a loofah or washcloth since the exfoliant does have actives in it, but this is the routine that works for me. Even if you’re not shaving, I think exfoliating regularly would make a difference! Give your hair time to grow out a little between shaves.\n\nI also ended up doing a few rounds of laser hair removal in my early twenties to thin my hair out. I didn’t keep going until bald and haven’t gone back for the recommended maintenance. This also made a huge difference since the bikini line was the problem area for me. This is obviously a more expensive route, but it was completely worth it in my opinion if you are able to budget for it.\n\nAs others mentioned, going to a derm would be the best way to approach this! No one explained exfoliating to me growing up and I struggled with ingrowns untl i figured this out.

But,  1- it cost me a lot of money. 2- hurts. 3-The hairs grow at different paces. So this happens: sparse hair growth on some places while some parts are still squeky bald. So either you still have to shave in between waxes, most days until all of them start to surface, or use tweezers or idk...  4- **It still caused and ARMY of ingrowns when the hair started growing back!!**\n* then finally settled for razors for being easier and fast. But shaving causes, ingrown hair, pimples, itchiness... etc...\n\nRecently i found out about electric razors. The reason i switched was like you, i had a problem with itchiness, and ingrowns. I heard other people talk about electric shavers fixing it and i gave it a go. Just bought the cheapest one i could find.  \n  \n Its fast like shaving, its painless, It doesnt itch when the hair starts to grow. Stopped my ingrown hair problem completely. My skin doesnt get irritated. And for some reason i dont get pimples anymore. \n\nAlso another tip. You can still get wet with a tampon inserted, like really normally wet. Never tried it but i assuma a cup/disc would work just as fine, as well. So if you worry about blood you can just put a disc/cup/small tampon in there so youll be sure there will be no blood, and you'll still get wet. But i would recommend mastrubating by yourself, with a vaginally inserted period product, to see how it works for **you**.\n\nSo, try this, **no razors for a week, only electric razor shaving beforehand the action, preferably a  vaginal disc inserted.

When I’m not having it regularly I’m irregular \n- probiotic yoghurt once a day. I have actimel. Keeps your bacteria healthy. \n- vaginal pessaries clean out your punani while balancing your pH. I’m so dysfunctional down there that I have to use two over two days after my period to reset the balance. \n- I have noticed that keeping clean shaven stops the abscesses - I used to get them on my labia. Very gross but it’s to do with glands getting gunked up. Sounds like you’re having to use liners every day which will cause irritation and pubes sadly trap more gunk that way (rather than their intended purpose to protect you from it). I still occasionally get them but it’s way less than before now. \n- shave ur ass girl. Dirt, sweat etc can make its way up if the hair is long enough to spread it around. Sadly we no longer live the same lives our caveman family did and we are constricted to pants. \n- cotton underwear also reduces sweat/moisture/bacteria from getting trapped. Go commando at night!! Let her BREATHE!\n- moon cups may allow you to be rid of the liners too. You can get small ones for spotting. \n- coming off birth control actually helped me, but I know everyone is different. If coming off is not an option perhaps you could try another one? I’m much better without any. \n- for your ingrown hair, after shaving, scrub yourself with a loofa or African sponge. Stops all that. (ETA: exfoliation prevents ingrown hair all over the body regardless of shaving so I suggest this regardless of the choice you make!)\n- apple cider vinegar baths. Just a little bit in your bath gently cleans you and keeps your pH balance. \n\nReading the Woman Code (can’t remember the author, it’s a pink/purple book) really helped me understand what my body needs and gave me much of this advice/helped me figure out my unique code. Also… please do not feel crap about how your labia look. They are as unique as hands are. Saying they look ‘gross’ is not fair to yourself and you shouldn’t feel bad.

Don’t be so hard on yourself.\n\nIn terms of improving some of this (based on my own experiences)\n\nThese abscesses for me I thought for years were just Bartholin cysts. Turns out I had mild Hidradentitis suppertiva. My derm put me on Spironolactone and this basically solved my problem and cleared up the area and I stopped getting bumps after a few months. It also helps women with PCOs which it seems you might have. It also made me less greasy in general too. \n\nI also recommend getting laser instead of shaving. It helps with irritation and bumps. It’s not that expensive. I didn’t do it for looks but for literally my sanity. I found a Groupon and paid $200 for 6 sessions. I did two sets of sessions and they were so so so worth it. They do the full vulva and the butt crack. You’ll need to do a full shave the day before but that’s it. Just the day before the laser. Eventually you won’t see much if any growing back\n\nIn terms of staying clean you need to take a minimum of one shower a day. Use dove bar soap. I use hypochlorous acid spray on my body when I get out of the shower\n\nIf you have a bit of an off smell you can also use boric acid suppositories for a few days to help freshen the area. Stop 24 hours before sex as it can irritate the penis. You could do this for a few days after a period to keep things fresh. \n\nAll of these are pretty basic and not overwhelming to keep up with but could really give you a sense of relief. \n\nThe biggest thing I recommend is reaching out to a doctor about Spironolactone.

So don’t be shocked if when you allow him to (because you should) that it doesn’t blow your mind in the way you may hope. You are young, you are still going through the end of puberty, and you still have time to choose to love yourself.

We saw each other twice a week for almost four months. With him, I discovered I can give a lot of pleasure, I forgot about my physical insecurities, I felt totally free in bed, and I tried positions and practices I had never done in my previous relationship. My self-esteem improved a lot, as did my awareness of my seductive power. Besides sex, we watched movies, slept together, cooked for each other, talked about our lives, almost always at our homes, and everything ended in passionate sex sessions. However, our personalities don't mesh. We're quite different in our ways of thinking, and he has opinions and attitudes that I don't like at all and that aren't compatible with my life (among other things, he drinks too much alcohol every weekend and uses drugs at electronic music parties). At first, that was good for me because I thought it would prevent me from developing feelings for him, but I gradually started to feel a stronger desire to move forward and feel chosen.\n\nTwo months after we met, I asked him what he was looking for, and he told me that his life was chaotic and he didn't want a relationship, that he usually dates for a year with someone just for sex and then sees if he wants a serious relationship. I understood the idea, and I started dating other guys too, but none of them gave me the same feeling in bed as he did. So yesterday, after almost four months of dating, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore because I get my hopes up and I know we don't have a future together. I've dated other guys, but I’m still hung up on him, and I can't wait a year to see if he likes me. He replied that he likes seeing me and would like to keep seeing me, but if this dynamic makes me uncomfortable and it's the best decision for me, he accepts it. He's annoyed about it because we were having a good time. Finally, he told me to let him know if I change my mind.\n\nIt makes me sad that he didn't try to save the situation. Doesn't he care about me? Besides, his response was selfish. I told him I was leaving because I was getting my hopes up with him, and yet he left the door open and said that if I regret it, I can come back... I don't know how to avoid falling for him again. The sex was so good, and I feel like it's going to be really hard to find someone else who can treat me like that, haha.

She lived in Mexico before we got married, and after we got together she moved to the US to build a life with me.\n\nHer family isn’t “private jet” rich, but they’re very well off. Stable. Connected. The kind of stable where problems are inconvenient, not life-altering. I grew up poor. Like, counting change and hoping the card doesn’t decline poor. I’ve always had this anxious relationship with money where it feels like it can disappear if I look away for too long.\n\nAnd right now we’re struggling financially. Not in a cute “we eat ramen sometimes” way. In a way that makes you do mental math every time the car makes a noise. In a way that turns small surprises into mini disasters.

Maybe she would have married someone else. Maybe she wouldn’t have. But I can’t stop thinking she would be happier and more secure than she is now.\n\nAnd the worst part is the guilt feels… righteous, like I deserve it.\n\nShe never throws it in my face. She doesn’t talk down to me. She doesn’t compare our life to what she “could have had.” She actually tries to encourage me when I’m spiraling. That makes me feel even worse, because she’s not even punishing me. I’m doing it to myself.\n\nSometimes when she’s on the phone with her family, I hear how easy things sound for them, and I feel like I dragged her into hard mode for no reason. Like she traded stability for love, and love wasn’t supposed to come with this many overdraft fees and stress headaches.\n\nI know marriage is supposed to be “for better or worse,” and we’ve had good years too.

We were both outsiders not wanting to talk about boys and makeup. Often times we’d just chase each other around the hotels at our away tournaments and not see any of our teammates—they were cliquey. As we got older and aged into 19u league, they started changing and finding their identity as a male in a femme body. They took Testosterone and although hadn’t gotten any surgeries done, he decided not to return to play girls travel, which i understand to this day, especially since you literally undress almost completely in front of your whole team every practice and game. I understood, but I was sad. Sad because this was the only time I got to see him, since we didn’t grow up in the same town. \n\nA couple years later we bumped into each other and spontaneously we caught up — it was like no time had passed. We laughed just like we always did and we left it like we would see each other very soon because we’d both been missing each other’s company. A few weeks after, I get a text via Snapchat asking “for a friend” how and where to acquire pills to ween someone off of an addiction. \n\nI genuinely thought it was for a friend and I had no connection to anything besides pot and alcohol, so I just apologized saying I hadn’t a clue and offered to help in any other way but they just said thank you for trying and that was the last I ever heard from him.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "I'm still struggling with the betrayal.", "text": "In spring of 2021 I met the girl (now, 26F) that eventually I came to believe I would spend the rest of my life with. At that time I was very depressed, I had just finally decided I wouldn't kill myself, and was still trying to figure out how to really live.\n\nWe had both been through some traumatic relationships in the past, we had both been mistreated and cheated on by past partners, and talked a lot about that baggage throughout our relationship. We experienced life together, traveled the country together, then after two years together, while struggling to find work after graduating college, we decided to move in with my parents who wouldn't charge us rent so we could find work and get our life together. We moved across the country to do this because she could not stand living with her (incredibly wealthy) parents. Her father was a legitimate diagnosed narcissist, and did not like me, and I have to say that feeling was mutual.\n\nSo we moved in with my parents, we used my old bedroom. Immediately she took over the entire space, and I didn't mind, I never was interested in decorating and I didnt care how the room was arranged. Eventually I ended up finishing half of my parents basement so I could have my own space because she couldn't sleep if I was awake in the room doing anything, and I am more of a night owl. \n\nShe had an easier time finding work, her resume was much lengthier than mine, and I struggled to even get a call back, let alone an interview. But she never stuck with any of the jobs she managed to get for more than a couple of months. Through this, she was very critical of me and my inability to find work, and eventually, between that and friction that had developed between us she decided that she didn't want to live with my parents and I anymore and was moving back in with her parents. She was ambiguous about what *our* future was, though. Once she left, we kept in touch, and two months later she called me to ask me if I would come to her family reunion in another state, I agreed. I met her whole extended family, was included in family photos, then within a week of me getting back she called to ask if she could move back in with my parents and I. I said yes.\n\nShe explained that her father had sold her on the idea that he was going to take her into the family business, buy her a house, basically do the rich parent thing and set their kid up, but had pulled the rug on that almost immediately once she moved in with them, and went back to his usual self. I asked her about her commitment to our relationship, as the way she had left things made me question it. She assured me that leaving was a mistake. \n\nShe moved back in and found a job at a local Cafe, but was in thousands of dollars of credit card debt and was struggling to make her car payments. My parents (Not wealthy, retired working class boomers) agreed to give her the money to pay it off so she could pay them back when she could afford it. Her parents, more specifically her father (her mother has basically zero control over their finances despite being the accountant and co-owner of their wealth management firm) refused to give her anything, saying, and I quote: \"that money is doing more good in the [stock] market\".\n\nAs time went on, we started thinking about the future and agreed that we wanted to spend our lives together and get married, she was so excited, telling people in my life behind my back before we had even made it official.\n\nEventually something unexpected happened to me. After being an atheist most of my life, I found  God. I won't get into the details of how that happened, but it took years until one day I finally broke down and emailed the priest of a local Church, arranged a meeting, and began learning to be a Christian.\n\nShe, despite calling herself a Christian, and being the only Christian in my life, was the only one in my life who was overtly hostile to this, which was bewildering as she had no problem with my atheism. I did not impose anything on her, I went to Church on Sundays, and tried to get my life together. Occasionally I'd invite her, knowing she would say no, but just to let her know that I had no intentions of excluding her from this part of my life. The few times we talked about spiritual things it became an argument, despite her not being able to articulate what it was she believed, and only ever expressing negative feelings about her religious upbringing, she was convinced I was some sort of heretic because of our denominational difference. The last time we spoke about those things, she said she never wanted to talk about it again, and I respected her request.\n\nFinally, I found a job, manual labor, 10 hour days, 6 day weeks with Sundays off. The pay was good and I started saving up for an engagement ring. She decided to go back to school at a local state school to get a second degree. By the time she had decided this she was already thousands of dollars in debt again and had yet to pay anything back to my parents, and was working twice a week for a few hours at an ice cream shop.\n\nSo she got accepted into the degree program and managed to get some scholarships and financial aid, and began classes this past August.\n\nAfter less than two months she began staying out late, saying she was studying or hanging out with friends. This went on for a while. All my instincts were telling me what was up, but I intentionally ignored them. I had come to trust her so implicitly that I thought, despite how obvious it was in retrospect, there was no way she would cheat on me, it must be my baggage, paranoia from being cheated on in my previous relationship, and I didn't want to ruin things by confronting her if I was imagining it. \n\nThen, there was the big and terrible reveal. On the 23rd of this past October, she came home and a reasonable hour, but something was up. Then she sat me down and told me she was leaving. Rather than telling me why, she handed me a letter for me to read in front of her. I refused and made her explain it to me. She had apparently been miserable, despite being excited about getting married and telling people about it just months beforehand, and it was all my fault. I then asked her if there was somebody else, still not believing that there was, still trusting her. For some reason she admitted it. \"You cheated on me\" I said, through my sobbing, her response was to laugh, and say \"thats really what your getting from this?\", then she grabbed some of her things and left.\n\nThe next day she came with a friend to help her pack up all of her things. I watched as they ignored my existence, giggling about their plans, and about my now exes new boyfriend. I watched as she learned for the first time that this girl she had only two months prior amd invited into my home wasn't even old enough to drink.\n\nIt turns out that her parents had stepped in, they paid back my parents for the money she owed them, had rented her an apartment by the school, and covered her tuition. And her entire plan for breaking up with me was coordinated over months with her mother. And apparently this plan was \"for me\", to make it \"easier for me\". I can't help but roll my eyes as I type that. \n\nNow for some context that really only became clear to me in retrospect. One of the first things we did together when we met was take a trip to another state in which she had been living and going to school, and was dropping out. I was helping her move, I thought it was strange that she was trusting a guy she had just met a couple of months ago to do this, but the red flag didn't register.\n\nWhile we were together, she attended 3 schools, moving each time, and only got a degree from one. On the second one, she had convinced a friend of hers to get an apartment with her by the school, she then just left and abandoned her friend to find another roommate after attending for only a couple of months. Obviously the two of them grew apart after that.\n\nAfter her, I was the person that had been in her life the longest. And throughout our relationship, she would meet people, they would immediately become her \"best friend\" then something dramatic would happen and they would stop being friends, or would simply stop hanging out and they would never be spoken of again. I should have seen it coming when she called me her \"best friend\".\n\nNow she's in a state where she  has zero connections formed before this past September, lives hours from her nearest extended family, and over a thousand miles away from where she grew up and her immediate family. She is a 26 year old woman whose entire social circle is early 20-something (and younger) college students that she has know for a few months at most, including her new boyfriend that she cheated on me with.\n\nI don't know how long its going to be before I feel okay again. We were together for four-and-a-half years, I wouldn't have been angry if she just left, she had already left once and handled it well, all things considered. I feel like I was played for a fool, that she wasted years of my life using me just to discard me when she found something that looked like an upgrade.\n", "score": 4, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767965129.0, "id": "1q886ae", "author": "hogecho", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q886ae/im_still_struggling_with_the_betrayal/"}

I should probably start off by saying that I’m non-monogamous, and extremely happy with my primary partnership, I have dated romantically outside of my relationship, but currently desiring to explore different fantasies and kinks.\n\nWhen I saw this in someone’s bio, I was intrigued. I’ve always wanted to be with someone on the larger side, and I found it exciting! all that said, I proceeded with a date and had a lot of buildup and excitement. The date went very well. there was connection, chemistry, and a lot of aligned values. Things that I look for before engaging with someone physically. At one point on the date, he even referred to how large it was.\n\nWhen things got hot and heavy, and the grand reveal came, I found myself quite disappointed. I have tried to do the work to undo hierarchy around size. But the truth is this was a factor in me going on this date! This was something that this person identified with. And quite frankly, it just wasn’t true.\n\nI have a shame that I was disappointed. However, at the same time, I’m finding myself perplexed. Is this a kink? Does he misunderstand what that means? Perhaps he just wants to be praised as such, but his listing was quite misleading.\n\nEdit: we were intimate and the following day he inquired how I was feeling in a way which implied he was well endowed. I like him but idk if I can lie about this- has no one told him? Do I play along?

(i had responded initially, but i didn’t remember doing so and it felt like a poor response.) i didn’t expect to hear back, and didn’t. his family deserves to grieve in peace and the K doesn’t really know me. however, after this and while going through L and i’s last messages exchanged, i think it’s possible there’s details or information that she does not know about that could possibly be relevant in L’s death.\n\nexamples are L was incarcerated and wanted to move in with me upon release. (1700 miles from our hometown, don’t know if anyone knows he asked me, and i don’t blame him. it wasn’t a good place for me either.) this was the third time L tried to have a home with me, but i told him no. he asked if there was a chance for us at all, and i avoided the question and will forever be haunted by my answer after his death. the last message i got from him was exactly a year before an apparent chainsaw incident that put him in the hospital less than a week before he died. the last phone call from L was exactly a year before he died. to me he wasn’t one to keep tabs on specific dates, but i can’t shake this coincidence. it feels incriminating even admitting i have these messages.\ni don’t even know what i’m doing here. i would never just volunteer this information to K, and truly don’t believe i’ll ever speak with her again. i feel messaging her in any capacity, ever would be an intrusion. there’s a possibility these messages offer details or events she doesn’t know about, but it won’t bring her son back. even if she asked, i don’t even know how to begin to explain why they could be relevant. i can’t go back and change what i said or what happened. \n\nit’s also entirely possible that other things happened in L’s life and i’m the one missing important information. i don’t fucking know. i will never know.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "(16M) I had an extremely sexual childhood", "text": "(Just keep reading please)\n\nI’m lying on my bed right now, just crying about this. I’ve only just realised how long I’ve been trying to suppress these memories. My whole life I’ve tried to forget about it, not telling anyone at all but I think it’s time.\n\nA lot of family troubles during my first few years on this earth, I had a drunk stepfather put me in the passengers seat at 3 years old and led to an accident. I have photos but the drivers side was completely wrecked but the damage done to the passengers wasn’t as devastating. I still remember waking up not knowing where i was but being strolled on some cart. Then waking up again at the hospital seeing my family crying over me. \n\nI get it’s not the point, but I just wanted to start off with the first wrong thing that ever happened to me.\n\nAfter I recovered from the accident, all was well. Personally everything after that was a bit of a blur, which is usual as I was a toddler after all. But fast forwarding to more significant memories..\n\nAt 4-5, things started getting really sexual. A kid from my neighbourhood, who seemed a little older than me started going to my house a lot. We would play toys together in my room and eventually he started showing his penis to me, and little me at the time I did the same thing. Little did we know, we were engaging in oral sex, kissing and spitting on our parts.\n\nIt seemed fun, and normal at the time. But it was kept a secret. I never ever hinted to my parents that this was happening to me at all. And I continued to do so.\n\nWhen I would feel horny and I was alone, I once broke off one of my robot toys head, and I would stick my dick in it and wiggle it around.\n\nThere was a girl I also knew, let’s call her Sarah. She was one of my family friends’ daughter, whom I’d touched.\nWe were both the same age around 4, toddler.\nAs these other sexual acts were happening to me, i couldn’t help but act on it, so i did.\n\nI took advantage of Sarah and i touched and licked her vagina, I also nearly put my penis inside her.\n\n\nAt age 6, I had my first experience of anal sex.\nIt was a family trip, and about 10 people including me, my parents and relatives from my mums side of the family.\n\nOne of the relatives was an older cousin, let’s call him Steven, who was 13 at the time. \nSteven had already touched me multiple times prior to this, and on the same trip we had been experimenting with oral sex when we were alone in the hotel room. My parents thought he was just playing Minecraft with me.\n\nThe whole family was in this one big hotel room. All of them drunk except for me and Steven, we slept on the same bed and as I was trying to sleep, he gently caressed my back and moved straight to my butt. He pulled me back and I could feel how hard he was, I genuinely was so confused at the time but all I could think was how exciting and good it felt.\n\nI reciprocated and I also touched his penis, to give Steven a sign. He was rubbing against my butt with his shorts still on, I initiated by taking Stevens shorts off.\n\nI turned around and my little body crawled down the bed under the blanket to start sucking it, and suddenly he moved my head off and pulled me up from under the blanket, taking my shorts off. Guessing what he was about to do, I just started rubbing my naked butt against his dick and that’s when he spread my cheeks out and tried putting it in me.\nHe eventually did put it inside, but only for a brief moment. He stopped and slept facing away from me.\n\nA few months pass and I regularly go to my relatives’ place to meet up with family. Whenever I go there the friends I have are Steven and my other cousins.\n\nIt would go from playing video games, minecraft, etc, to him showing me porn and showing his dick so I can suck it.\nEventually enough tension built up to the point he grabbed some lube this time and applied it around my asshole, then put his dick inside me. \n\nI didn’t know whether to feel bad about it or feel good, I didn’t know what was happening to me. \n\nThis happened multiple times with Steven (He would finish inside me nearly every time I’d visited).\n\nThis wasn’t the only male cousin that had done these sexual acts with me. In fact, there were 4 cousins in total including Steven, but the others didn’t engage in anal sex.\n\nMy parents still don’t know anything about this. I haven’t told anyone, ever.\n\n(TL:DR)\nI grew up exposed to a lot of adultery as a child. As much as it seemed to feel as if I was living a normal childhood, there was trauma running in the background. I don’t wish for any child to ever experience this. \n\nNow i’m 16, turning 17 and I’m being pressured to decide on what career paths I want to pursue and what subjects im going to study in uni, but it’s just..\nHow can I decide and plan for my life, when all this shits happened and I haven’t fully processed everything yet?? I just, I feel like I need a break. A pause from everything. That’s how I feel.\n\nI have so much freedom, yet I’m stuck, i’m aware i’m young. But the emotions i’m feeling are just so intense right now, I just hope it gets better. \nI’ve been thinking so much about my child self and how badly i would wanna protect it now. I feel so bad for me.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "I’m sorry that so many people that you should have been able to trust treated you in these ways. Nobody that young should be forced into experiencing things like that while being too unaware of what they really are. \n \nI can’t comment on most of what you said, but as for choosing your future… don’t stress about it. I know, I know, easier said than done, right? I don’t mean you literally don’t have to stress about it, but try to find comfort knowing that whatever choices you make, the future will come your way regardless. Instead of thinking of it as “making the choice that makes the future happen,” it helps me to think of it as “the movie is playing, but I have the remote and get to choose if I speed it up or pause for a bathroom break.” Not a perfect analogy, but hopefully you get what I mean.\n \nIf you’re not ready to make long-term life choices, then maybe you do take a break. My friend took a gap year and she seemed to really enjoy it. I went straight to college, graduated early, and proceeded to never use my degree so far. I don’t regret my time there, but I wish I could go back again and study new things. \n \nBut that’s also a cool part, even after you make a choice for your future, you get to keep making more choices! You might decide to be a doctor but then decide to be an accountant. You might decide to take a huge trip but then decide just visiting a nearby state sounds more relaxing. \n \nSo many choices while we’re teenagers feel like they have to be set in stone and determine our futures, but I can probably only name about 30% of my high school class that stuck with their first choice (and that’s being generous).\n \nThe best lesson I’ve learned as a young g adult is that old people don’t know what they’re doing, they just have enough experience to to act like they do so young people take them seriously. We’re all humans learning, it’s okay to take time and figure out what pace you learn best at.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "offmychest", "text": "Hey so some alternate perspective here.\n\n\nI know a guy who did this. He cheated dozens of times on his wife. The guilt ate him alive after a few years and he ended up confessing to her. She forgave him and said she'd stay if they went to couples therapy. This opened up a psychological investigation into his behavior. It was very clear that he was some kind of sex addict with some history of sexual abuse in his childhood that he had never faced.\n\n\nMy friend went to therapy for a few years and he and his wife did pretty well. He ended up killing himself last year, which nobody saw coming. He explained in the letter he left that he truly felt horrible for what he did, and he swore that since his confession he had not cheated or broken her trust in any way. But he could not bear the shame, and could not deny that he still had the urges.\n\n\nI spoke with him several times before he died. We spoke at length about what it was that made him cheat. Through therapy he learned about himself that his primary sexual motivator was novelty. Novelty means a lot of things, but for him it meant new people. New people were appealing to him because they could not hurt him emotionally, and he would not get attached to them. This came from his abuse, in which his first \"sexual\" (nonconsensual) experiences were foisted on him by a person he loved and trusted.\n\n\nHe told me a lot of things about the addiction and how he never ever meant to harm his partner and he was not doing it out of malice. He just was not able to be satisfied by one person. In fact, he was never satisfied ever. Hence addiction.\n\n\nIt's very easy for us to look at people like him and call him a monster and say he deserves what he gets, and why didn't he just dump his wife so he could go fuck around. But addicts of all types long for acceptance and they seek love when they aren't seeking their drug. It is a complicated matter.\n\n\nI'm not saying any of this to defend your boyfriend. I'm saying it to tell you honestly, his cheating was NOT about you. It was about him. He has a lot of maturing and a lot of therapy to do. You MIGHT be able to reduce the likelihood he will do this to someone else in the future by reading this comment to him and encouraging him to seek therapy immediately because he IS an addict and HE NEEDS HELP. He's young, so right now it doesn't feel like addiction. But it is, and he needs to attack it right away before he grows up and gets into a really horrific situation where he's cheating on his wife and she's financially dependent upon her.\n\n\nCheating is very bad. But nobody should be killing themselves over it on either side. Hope you are okay, and just know that his addiction IS NOT a statement about who you are or what youre like in bed.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1767997500.0, "id": "nyojjcz", "author": "JarOfNightmares"}

For some context he's always been overly spoiled and given mountains of toys, electronics, etc. Being an only child and all with parents that I dont have beef with but they enabled this kind of behavior to go on for way too long and its only getting worse. At first I didn't care too much because he was just a kid that always got what he wanted and it didn't affect me at all, but as he's grown up, very severe narcissistic tendencies have come to light fueled by his greed and ego and it's really messing with my mental because I truly love the kid like a brother but he's walking down a very lonely, sad road. Pretty recently his father remarried and moved in with his wife who is the sweetest lady but in doing so gave his old house to D which i have no problem with because its his house to do with what he pleases, but this only inflated his ego even further. Not to mention since D's parents split he's been living with his mother all throughout high-school and some years after graduating because he views his father, who's only ever given him all he's wanted, like an embarrassment who only brings him shame even though he just got a house for free in this economy which is like winning the lottery at this point, at least where I live, but enough backstory for now. So within the last 3 years, he's lied about how much money he truly makes throughout his multiple jobs which I would just laugh about because c'mon I don't care about how much money you make or bragging I think it's cringe to do so, especially when you're lying about it but he's recently landed himself a good job making a very good wage with minimal physical strain, and im happy for him, he's even managed to buy his dream car (120k) in a matter of 4 to 5 months of work but his bragging and belittling of people has only worsened in buying said car. \"If you make less than 300k a year you're broke\" in his words, and have no way to touch him on his golden pedestal. I cant even play video games with him as long as we used to because of the near constant bragging and ego slop like the constant \"im him!!! Im him!!!\" it genuinely gives me migraines. And with his obsession with greed and a Everest sized ego came a very, very annoying habit of D being a complete asshole for no other reason than thinking he's a superior person compared to the rest of us. It's a constant battle of \"im right you're wrong\" \"I know more than you\" (which is hilarious because he barely passed highschool)\"I make more than you so your opinion is invalid\", just constant degrading remarks which I think is hilarious because he'll never say these things face to face because he knows he's not winning a physical altercation with anyone for that matter, im not saying I want to fight him because he's like my little brother and I dont want to hurt him ever but holy shit he makes it so hard not to especially with the things he says and his blatant disregard for other people and their feelings, especially women. Which I think stems from his parents split and his father's not so kind words about his mother constantly when he was young (his mother is a very kind and fun person to be around and he still treats her like crap for no reason) and im just kind of at my limit for tolerating his behavior but on the other hand I don't want to stop being his friend because I want to believe that there's still some good left in him. I would very much love some outside perspective, thank you for reading my post.\n\nTL;DR - My cousin's ego is past inflated\n\nMy cousin D treats everyone around him like crap for being \"broke\" and is a narcissist who is obsessed with money and himself,  please help!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Getting into a relationship seems impossible", "text": "I don't care too much about being in a relationship right now, I mean it'd be nice, but I'm not desperate or anything. The main issue I have is actually meeting someone, and then actually getting to know each other enough. I don't go to places to directly look for a date, I just socialise and hope I'll meet someone I like and take it from there. That's kinda how I want it, to get to know each other as friends for a bit, then we end up liking each other. \n\nI didn't meet anyone at college, so now I just go to work, but I work with a bunch of middle-aged dudes mainly. Plus I probably wouldn't want to date a coworker, and it's not like work is the best place to make friends anyway. I'd be open to it of course, it's not the end of the world if I become friends with a coworker and we end up liking each other \n\nSo I'd go to social clubs and stuff, but still, there's the issue that there needs to be a girl I like, who's single, likes me back, and we're compatible enough to be together. Not to mention that it's hard to actually establish that initial friendship, usually I talk to people and if they're chill, I try to sorta progress our friendship, without seeming clingy of course. The issue is that they usually have closer friends already, and don't really put in the effort that I do. I do still go to these places just to talk to similar people even if we don't actually become good friends though \n\nSo idk if I'll actually meet someone, it seems so difficult. Most girls my age I meet are already in relationships, aren't my type, or I'm not their type, or we have big incompatibilities. So it feels kinda impossible that I will, ever actually get into a relationship. Of course, I'll just live my life doing whatever the hell I will be doing, I'll still be happy I guess, but I do want to be in a relationship one day...", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767957822.0, "id": "1q85s3v", "author": "Jay-Tripper", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q85s3v/getting_into_a_relationship_seems_impossible/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "Graduation Celebration Disappointment or Am I Being Unreasonable?", "text": "Am i (22F) being unreasonable?\n\nIm done with college and this is likely the last time i’ll ever walk a school stadium for a diploma since i doubt id ever go back to school for a graduate degree. It just doesnt align with my professional interests. To me, its a big deal to graduate college. Im graduating with a bachelors and a certificate and have worked really hard to get here. My parents are supportive in the sense that they will show up to my graduation. However, I really wanted to go all out since I know this is the last of my academic schooling. My whole life, my parents have placed such a big emphasis on college degrees and I feel like this is such a big personal accomplishment so i was hoping i could take a graduation trip or have a graduation party. I brought it up to my dad and he said “maybe if we have the money.. Your stepbrother is gonna go to nursing school and it’s a lot of money” Im kind of under the impression that nothing will happen in the end. My parents have said that money is tight for years, and buy i find it really hard to believe that when they spend so lavishly on anything else. (Eating out at least once a day because they dont want to cook and want to eat fresh food, spending thousands during christmas, etc). I saw their tax returns and i know they make well into upper middle class jointly.\n\nMy dad kept saying that he’ll treat me and my stepbrother to a trip next year when im done with getting my CPA and my brother finishes nursing school. With how rigorous the CPA exams are, im not sure if i’ll be able to pass within that time frame. Also, i’d rather celebrate finishing college rather than getting my CPA… To add on, I really doubt that my parents would actually treat us to a vacation since they aren’t the type of people to follow through on their word about matters like this.\n\nSide tangent: I think I am a bit bitter too because I chose to go to a state school instead of a more prestigious school because my parents said it was too much money (the cost for my school wouldve been the same as my stepbrother’s) not. Also because they offered a trip to Hawaii for my stepbrother’s highschool graduation..\n\nMy aunt and uncle are throwing a party for my cousin and offered to include me so it would become a joint party. My cousin and I are extremely close, and my cousin is happy to include me in her celebrations. However, i feel bad. I feel like her graduation party should be solely hers and I feel like a leech. Especially because my aunt and uncle are taking on 100% of the financial load. I offered to help pay for the party, especially because I know they dont make as much compared to my family, however they rejected my offer and said “its a gift.” I feel even more bad because I know my aunt and uncle are gonna rent out a venue, order catering, decorate the whole place, and I feel like some freeloader. My cousin asked if my parents could help instead. So, I asked my dad if him and my stepma could help pitch in but he dodged the question.\n\nI tried to take matters into my own hands and I suggested a New York graduation trip with my cousin. Luckily, she wants to go (otherwise I wouldnt have been able to go since my parents say im not allowed to travel alone). I worked hard the past few months and saved so I can have enough to fully self-fund this trip.\n\nI feel like Im being spoiled. Im getting both the graduation trip and party and I still dont feel satisfied. I dont know whats wrong with me. Im trying to focus on the positives because on paper, everything should be fine since I’m ending up with both my two dream graduation celebrations. But then I remember how it doesnt feel like my parents are showing up for me —especially my Dad since I’m his only kid— and then I feel bitter all over again. Am i being unreasonable? I dont have anyone to talk to about this who I feel like could give an objective response about my reaction.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 18, "created_utc": 1767957498.0, "id": "1q85otb", "author": "blueren7", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q85otb/graduation_celebration_disappointment_or_am_i/"}

One day we had a school program and we had to practice I went to the practice and instantly felt bored so when we had quick bathroom break instead of going to the bathroom I went out. Now for context in my province there 2 cities the capital and let's call the other City City B. When I went out I was curious what City B looks like since I have never went there and thinking is it better than capital or my town so I went to bus station for City B.I have never told anyone I'm going to a city B. The moment I arrive there I was stunned of course it was bigger than my hometown but smaller than the capital of course. I first went eating trying to be careful with my money until saw a building where people was playing billiards but it the players were secretly gambling.I was very good at billiards and thought I could earn some money but I was wrong I lost some money and when check what was remaining I didn't have enough to afford to go back home. My first plan was drop of to the furthest I can with my money and walk to the capital then call my parents to pick me up.but I realize my parents were busy so instead I tried to befriend a guy let's call him Bob. I met In the park there and he was like probably late fifty or early sixty so I thought he would be nice and kind and learned bob was also going to capital later in the day so I ask him if I can come with him Bob said sure so we went to bus station and I acted that I lost my money luckily he paid for my fee. On the bus station Bob started acting strange asking me private and personal questions like \"what's my exact adress\" or \"whats is my parents full name\" of course  I lied to because of course I dint know the guy and I was so glad I didn't because later in the ride he started touching my  area where men pee and I told him  what was he doing and Bob just said to don't him him he also started talking more to me in the flirtatious tone and look ever. At first I was trying to be open minded until he said that he should come to my house and I should to come to his house then bob asked me do I have a girlfriend of course I told him yes because I had one and he look offended and sad and Bob said after that I come to his house and teach me somethings and instantly felt uncomfortable when we arrive at the capital I ask some money from him and he gave me some money. Bob told me we should take a picture but I told him I was on hurry luckily Bob didn't mind so I started walking to bus station going to my hometown until I realize he was following me I asked him what was he doing and Bob replied that he's making sure I was safe so instead of walking to the bus station going to my home town I went to a different bus station going to another town.after I was far away to not bob see me I hopped of the bus still in the capital though and went to actually now the bus station going to my hometown. \n\nLesson learned get more money, don't gamble or just don't skip practice ", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767957201.0, "id": "1q85lph", "author": "Pure_Struggle_7804", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q85lph/im_never_skipping_practice_again/"}

He turned out to be really full of himself and always found fault in what we made. He would say things like that is not a way to do it or why did you build that it is a bad idea. We were getting pretty upset, with him. At first we tried to just ignore the Minecraft expert and his bad attitude.\n\nOne day he just. Destroyed our whole world. He put TNT over the village and blew it up. We were really mad at him. We told him that we had spent a lot of time building it. Over three months. He did not say sorry. Instead he. Said he was helping us. He said our builds were bad and he could make better Minecraft builds. This made us very angry. We had a big fight, about the Minecraft builds and what he did to our village and our Minecraft world.\n\nIt has now been a month since the incident, but he continues to act as if he is innocent.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "offmychest", "title": "my perception of people as dolls", "text": "Hello everyone. Please forgive me if this sounds rude or unclear; I don’t mean to offend or belittle anyone. This is simply how I see the world. If I look closely at people, I start to notice these things—especially in their facial expressions. I truly apologize if this post hurts anyone; I am not looking for an argument or a debate. I just want to understand: is it normal to see things this way? Do others see this too? For me, it’s not just occasional—it’s constant.\nI see myself and everyone else as dolls. These dolls vary.\nThere are plastic dolls: their movements are sharp and sometimes jerky. Despite their unpredictability, they are quite predictable because they follow a perfectly straight line. They can be frightening because their movements feel so... \"plastic.\"\nThen there are puppets (marionettes). This is the majority of people I meet. They move along strings; their motions resemble mechanisms because they are being \"driven.\" They cannot step outside their boundaries unless they become aware of their strings. But even realizing the strings exist doesn't grant freedom—the strings might fray or snap, but true freedom remains out of reach. Their movements can be strange at times, but they follow their script until they realize it.\nThere are also rubber dolls. They are fluid. Their movements look smooth and quiet, making them unpredictable and sometimes unclear because they are just too fluid.\nMostly, I encounter puppets. Sometimes I can actually see their strings—it’s visible in their movements, in the contours of their bodies, and especially in their facial expressions. An expression can look too tight, as if pulled, or too loose, as if the tension was suddenly released.\nBut then, who is the Creator? The Puppeteer? I don’t think there are any Puppeteers among humans. Even those who seem to pull the strings are just dolls themselves. Perhaps some are allowed more because they are aware; they can hold the strings of others without being tied to them, but they are still dolls. They just don't want to show it.\nI see empathy in a similar way. If empaths are people who feel the emotions of others, it’s as if they tie their own string to someone else’s. If a human is a doll with mechanisms and threads, then an empath attaches their thread to another's, allowing them to feel those emotions so acutely.\nPlease forgive me for this post.
