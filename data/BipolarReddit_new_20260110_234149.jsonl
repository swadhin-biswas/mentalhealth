{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "Lithium causing lack of initiative?", "text": "Hey everybody, this is a long post about lithium but also just to vent i guess :D\n\nQuestion about  fatigue/lack of initiative on monotherapy with lithium,\n\nI (M41) was diagnosed with BPD2 3 years ago. Mainly constant depression since early teenager with 3 short slightly hypomanic episodes that  just qualifies my for the diagnosis. Also i have ADHD - not treated due to side effects from treatment (all meds).\n\nI have tried all medication for BPD before i ended up on lithium. I had had a severe depression, then i had ECT and lithium which brought me to a new, good place.\n\nI am currently on monotherapy with lithium citrate 900 mg. Antidepressants = side effects.\n\nThe reason i am writin is that even though I, finally for the first time in my life, being +40 years, can sleep without wanting to die or the first thought in the mor and can sleep 7-8 hours most nights.\n\nBut STILL i am tirred in the evening. I dont really wana go out. I also constantly forget to text friends back. Cant make plans because the thought of picking up the phone and opening whatsapp or whatever and texting seems overwhelming.\n\nI feel like i first of all am missing a spark - also it feels like the dopamine level is low - workout which i used to love is just mwah, i dont find joy in making friends happy etc.\n\nI had  very bad childhood - following low self esteem and from 13-40 years old wanting to die die die die (which just kept going on an on in my head 24/7).\n\nAfter the ECT  + lithium i know experience a life without this thougths - and i feel like my teens, 20s, 30s have been robbed from me. I have been doing amazing stuff - but never enjoyed it.  \nLIke climbing Mt. everest but standing on the top just wanting to die. Graduating med school, just wanting to die as i received papers. Never had a partner because i was afraid to ask anyone out due to experiences in school.   \nIm a doctor but ended in a specialty that i didnt want to because of my psyche and my job feels meaningless.\n\nI know there is also some existential thing going on obviously - I have had so many hours of therapy, it has helped but doesnt any more.\n\nSO now im here - the best in my life ever, BUT still far from the goal. And yes, i am patient - but its been like this for a year now and i feel i should try do something.\n\n  \nI am being followed by a psychiatrist - I take my medication, i see a psycologist as well and attend group therapy. I have been seen by a  special psychiatric department but they dont know what to do. All my blood values are ok etc.\n\nI believe the lithium is the right treatment - but i need som help to overcome the fatigue and lack of spark.  \nI am on waiting list for new assesment for ADHD - but they dont have other drugs to give so im a bit skeptic :)\n\nI am thinking about trying to do ACT therapy - to try to get a goal in my life since i feel i dont have a purpose/it feels meaningless.\n\nDoes anyone have had similar effect with lithium that they managed to overcome? i tried to go slightly down on dosis (with my doctor) but that was not good).\n\nhave a nice day\n\n   \n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768034978.0, "id": "1q8z80q", "author": "Acrobatic_Ad_5587", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q8z80q/lithium_causing_lack_of_initiative/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "I've no experience with citrate since carbonate tends to be the main prescribed form of lithium in the states, but presuming they're dose equivalent, I would be SHOCKED in lithium is causing your lack of initiative. I've felt blunted by lithium maybe twice in my life and only on crazy high doses (like 1450mg) taken all at once IR nightly and even then it's only been for an hour or so in the morning until I hydrate. It wouldn't shock me if other people are more sensitive to that feeling, but I would be shocked if the feeling is present enough and sustainable enough considering how fickle lithium is in our bodies to be causing such a persistent issue. \n\nIf anything medical is liable to cause this, I would presume the ECT may have done a little bit of blunting that was unintentional, but even then, modern ECT is pretty well-honed and well-tolerated.\n\nFrankly, what you're going through sounds way more behavioral and in the realm of psychology rather than psychiatry. As somebody with similar self-esteem issues who has similarly impeded my own career because of uniquely negative thoughts about myself, it really does just sound like a self-esteem problem and that that's the start and stop of it. I wish there was a better answer, but I seriously think the answer for you is just going to be a lot of therapy, developing a lot of grit, and pushing yourself to new limits. \n\nOt's really hard to make yourself be uncomfortable and try for things that might not work. Recently, I developed a massive crush on a coworker and ended up leaving the position but kept pursuing him and frankly I don't think it's going very well for me. I think it's pretty one-sided attraction and I think I'm running up against a wall, but me 10 years ago would have never even tried to get his number let alone take him on dates or try to court him. That said, trying and failing stuff like that has actually made me a better human being in a lot of different ways. Because of younger version of myself was able to get out of my own way, even at the expense of a lot of failure, this current version of myself is pretty comfortable doing so; being able to handle the loss without personalizing it and being able to tolerate the risk. More than that, when I have successes in my career or in my romantic life, I've developed the ability to really enjoy myself. \n\nYou're lack of initiative seems like it's rooted in that. Either a lack of ability to tolerate risk, a lack of ability to see yourself is worthy, a lack of ability to let yourself have good things, or a combination of the three. Personally, this issue did get a little bit better for me when I tested my testosterone level and saw that it was very low for my age; having a healthy testosterone level has literally made a world of difference for me, but I'm also a little bit of a niche case and honestly the testosterone played such a small impact that I don't even know if it's related. So much of the stuff lives in our heads and the only way to get it out of our heads is to show ourselves other possibilities than the ones our brains are imagining. Ensure, sometimes you will mess up and things won't go your way and you will get crushed and give your brain a lot of information to beat yourself up with, but the only way to get that new information is to keep trying and trying and trying until you can see yourself in a better place.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768036140.0, "id": "nyrbq6p", "author": "redactedanalyst"}

I even had an acute crisis that required emergency intervention after months of stability. The disorder is ungrateful and sensitive, but it's manageable. There is hope, at least I hold on to that. Accepting the diagnosis is the first step towards stability. What led to my inconsistency with treatment in the first years after diagnosis was the invalidation from others, and from myself. But accepting the disorder is inevitable for treatment, if there are supporting symptoms and they are evaluated by professionals. Something that helped me not blame myself so much for the disorder is understanding how it works. I've suffered with symptoms for almost 8 years, and in that time I always blamed myself a lot because I didn't see \"real reasons\" for not being able to live life like everyone else. Understanding that my brain is different, that it works differently, and that I have to adapt the environment around me, and not adapt my brain, helped me make peace with the disorder and have a better quality of life.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "Hypomania or Euthymic?", "text": "To start: \nI’ve perused the subreddit already for similar posts and will delete my post to not clog the sub after I get some opinions. \n\nI received a diagnosis for rapid cycling bipolar 2 and I was in a severe mixed episode for 2 and a half months. Coming out of it, I went numb. Completely numb. Not depressed or suicidal, even, just nothing. Pure absence of emotion or thought, which was scary because I’ve never had that kind of ‘episode’ before. I’m only on 12.5mg of Lamictal (I’m slowly dosing up) so I don’t think it’s medication related. \n\nSlowly, I’ve started to feel again. \nSometimes I have racing thoughts, often moreso at night these past few days. The other night, I could not fall asleep, woke up after 4 hours of sleep for work at 6am, felt absolutely fine, not tired, and went to work. Was fairly energetic and didn’t go to sleep until 2am, but was able to get 7 hours and felt fine going to work as well (not sure). In essence, I wasn’t tired, and don’t feel a need for sleep. The second day of work, I felt quite irritable, angry, and short tempered. I had some of the “skin crawling” feeling but it hasn’t been consistent. Sometimes I catch myself smiling to myself, I get the “euphoria rush” from certain songs where I fixate on one line and play it over and over 2828374 times, and I have the urge to spend money, but I’ve been able to control that (bar for a bag of chips I didn’t need and only ate half of lol). These ‘bad’ or ‘negative’ feelings have only been really coming on in the late afternoon or night (with no trigger most of the time). \n\nI do find myself getting fixated on different like, shopping websites, but I’ve been able to curb my spending so far and I don’t know if that’s because I’m telling myself I’m hypo and I don’t need it or if I’m actually just being financially responsible. \n\nI’m newly diagnosed so I’ve been hyper aware, it feels, and it’s been a while since I’ve felt this “okay”, so I just don’t know if it’s been so long I’ve forgotten or what. I feel like I tend to forget what real stability is like, because in my hypomanic episodes when I haven’t been depressed, I’ve been so relieved I’ve felt better. \n\nI think sometimes I struggle with the “sleep” aspect as a symptom for identifying episodes because right now, I’m not sleeping 7 hours because I feel I need to, I will wake up after 3 hours and feel rested, I just stay in bed and fall back asleep because my bed is comfy cozy and it’s freezing outside.  \n\nI just, I don’t know. I know I’m overanalyzing but I guess I’m just desperate to start getting an understanding and an explanation into the instability I’ve had my entire life. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading and I appreciate any opinions/advice : ) \n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 19, "created_utc": 1768004129.0, "id": "1q8p0u6", "author": "aphroditic-love", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q8p0u6/hypomania_or_euthymic/"}

I have been hearing voices but ONLY if I listen for them. They aren’t bothering me. I believe that they’re spirits if I’m honest with you. I don’t feel paranoid. I just feel… normal. Nothing much else has happened. The last time I came off my meds things started getting pretty bad pretty quickly.\n\nThat being said, I want to look up theories. I want to start putting dots together, because deep down I feel like there’s a truth that I’ll be able to expose or learn about the universe which has happened in the past. I’m trying to keep away from that sort of stuff because I know it could set me into a spiral.\n\nIdk. I want to manage without the meds so badly. I think I’m doing okay.

It’s also a libidinal drive. We think that, with each connection we make, we are exposing more and more of the world for ourselves. And there is a sense of power and euphoria in that: we are the ones penetrating the nothingness in order to make something out of it. \n\nAt a certain point, we can never give up the process of interpretation.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "Full disclosure I’ve never been officially diagnosed with bipolar due to severe iatrophobia and because, at least when I was younger (and in the Navy) I was really good at masking/lying about what I was going through, including the full extent of what I was going through to my doctors when I eventually did seek help. The antidepressants I was prescribed certainly gave me periods of very much elevated mood, but did absolutely nothing to bottom out the *ahem bad periods of depression. The cycle was overall the same as before the antidepressants, just even more extreme. But I continued taking them anyway because at the time I deluded myself that they were helping and neurotically continued to lie to my doctors the full extent of what I was going through even after i separated from the navy in 2018, and I told myself that i couldn’t possibly have bipolar because if I did it would be “obvious”. So anywho some time later in 2019 i believe I was living in my car homeless after being essentially kicked out of the place I was living at and didn’t have the executive functioning or give a damn to renew my 450 mg bupropion prescription so quit that cold turkey just as I had quit Prozac cold turkey for the same reason a few years earlier. Total nightmare obviously. And then I basically somehow gruelled my way through life for a few years, somehow got through Lvn school, and somehow survived a whole year as a nurse with having my debt finally being paid down keeping my spirits up before crashing and burning. And so basically I was just laying in bed in 2022, completely without hope, not even caring if you know, and I’m not kidding some instinct told me to finally research lithium as a nutrient because that had always been a question on the back of my mind for a very long time. And I took a very much self medicating dose of lithium orotate and then an even higher dose of lithium orotate just to convince myself that the effect from the first dose wasnt just a placebo, because the relief was actually very much rapid. And I continued taking it and my symptoms continued to seek to improve over time .And since then there’s been multiple studies published providing me hard evidence that my experience was/is not a placebo. So yeah. It’s Not a silver bullet, certainly not a cure, but very much profoundly useful. I still have semi annual troughs in my mood, but not even remotely as bad as before I discovered lithium orotate.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767992095.0, "id": "nyo07ca", "author": "Longjumping-Panic401"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "TL;DR Cat\n\nI always had dogs growing up and throughout adulthood until this April when I was discharged from inpatient. My (now ex) husband left me and took the dog. So I got a cat. I let the cat choose me and went to a few shelters until I found one that just chilled with my 5yo and seemed to want to be around me. Let me tell you this little orange one brain cell goober is the best thing that’s ever happened to my mental health. \n\nAlmost all the dogs I’ve had were anxious and had behavior problems. I sank thousands of dollars into training every dog I had, I did agility as a kid. I’ve had purebred dogs, I’ve had shelter dogs, I’ve had dogs that random family members gave me. I loved my dogs! My little pug mix senior was the best one I ever had. But dogs are so hard and if they have behavior issues it’s so difficult. And then the dog community can be so shaming if you do need to rehome a dog, it was exhausting. \n\nThis little cat is the best. Not every cat is like him, some are difficult too. But this one? I got out of inpatient and did IOP for 4 weeks. I’d sit at my computer in group therapy for hours and he would just come sit in my lap. It was like he knew when I was getting emotional and he would come bother me. He’s literally sitting in my lap with his paw on my hand while I type this. \n\nI vote cat. Dogs are cool, but they’re very high maintenance usually and I’ve had dogs with issues so severe that it greatly worsened my mental health and stress. My cat is so cool.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "So I have three cats and two dogs, I really think it depends on what your life is like. \n\nIf you don't struggle with keeping routines and are able to provide the extra attention a dog needs (daily walks, cleaning up after it, baths), a dog could be a great companion for you.\n\nBut, fair warning, puppies are a MESS. You need to actively train them, because otherwise they chew on absolutely everything and steal socks/shoes/whatever they can get their grubby little paws on. You will also need to potty train them and to socialize them so they don't freak out at the sight of other doys. They're practically one step below a human toddler, and you will also need to pretty much baby-proof your home (unless you want to have an emergency vet trip at 11pm because somehow the puppy ate an entire rattan basket. True story). \n\nSo from this aspect, although a puppy can bring a lot of joy and life into a home, I really recommend adopting an adult dog if you go the dog route. There's many amazing dogs in shelters looking for a home, and they will most likely already be socialized, potty trained, vaccinated and spayed/neutered, saving you a lot of money.\n\nCats on the other hand are generally easier to care for, so I'd recommend them more to someone who struggles with mental health, because they won't suffer if you fall into an episode and suddenly can't give them their daily walk. Just feed them and clean their litter box. Contrary to what the internet will have you believe, cats can also be very sweet and affectionate companions!\n\nTL;DR: Both are good options but dogs need significantly more work.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767969016.0, "id": "nylnpou", "author": "shadosharko"}

The memory stuff around that has been hard, I went from resus to stepping back to the less complex areas of the department and it has taken me nearly a year to get my confidence back. \n\nI’m really open with my colleagues - for many reasons. Breaking down the stigma is really important to me, especially when we only see bipolar patients at their sickest and it becomes easy to forget that between episodes people can live really good, functional lives. I’ve also been at my current job for quite a long time, so it’s fairly obvious to the colleagues who know me when I’m unwell and I’d rather they hear the truth from me than mindless gossip. It’s also helpful to have people on my side who can tap me on the shoulder and support me to take time off. I’m very lucky I have an excellent manager. I have an exemption from working night shift because it just makes me unwell. \n\nNursing school and working as a nurse with bipolar is hard. It can be really hard.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "Since you're in healthcare you know the lithium can stop working forever if you stop taking it. It's the best med we've got for BP1. It's unlikely you'll be able to detect the next episode on your own early enough to matter. You'll very likely lose your job and possibly your career depending on how bad it is/how it manifests. Healthcare is a touchy one, bc they don't want unstable employees who go off meds for obvious reasons, and they really don't want BP1 employees w that history. You can get discontinuation psychosis coming off the olanzipine, of course you know that as a medical pro but just in case. BP1 is much harder to manage without lithium. The side effect profile of the other meds is significantly more problematic, I was effectively chemically castrated for decades for example. You'll need an emergency action plan, I'm sure you already have one, WRAPs is peer written and more thorough than average so maybe look that over. You are going to need people around you informed, not at work obviously as that's a career killer if they know what you've got, but friends, family, anyone living with you, taking them into psych appts with you for BP educational purposes so they can help ID it faster as you almost certainly will not be able to. Your decision making process is currently so poor you may be in episode already. That needs to be assessed. Again obviously you are working with your psychs on this re your tapers, increased therapy appts for monitoring. attendance at BP support groups is a good idea as they'll likely be able to ID early episode faster than your docs. Your friends and family can take classes, read books, watch videos but it usually takes them a few episodes to be really on the ball, they'll also need some encouragement to be truly proactive as often politeness or fear of your irritation can cause them to hesitate to inform you, so you need to check in with them regularly and ask them if they see anything. Tracking mood and sleep of course, I assume you are already, the issue is insight is often the first thing to go so you won't see it coming. if you have those around you also track your mood and sleep that's helpful. you will have to rely almost entirely on their eyes. You will likely be unwilling to treat when they see it, so you need to have written contracts with them re what to do when you refuse treatment and are clearly manic. Ideally you are fully financially supported by others and it doesn't matter if you blow up your job, career or relationship. It's better to test this now then later in life for those reasons, ideally you'd want five years of total stability before doing this to give your brain the best chance to heal as a small percentage of BP1 people really are one and done on episodes and that's your best chance, but if health is not your goal I suppose that doesnt matter. The more episodes you get the harder they are to treat, the more often and more easily they tend to occur, and permanent cognitive damage is possible, so hopefully you're done with school. Post mania recovery time for the temporary cognitive damage and the following depression is often years, so hopefully also you aren't doing anything difficult or important for a while after this. Good luck OP.\n\nGive someone else control of your money. And passport.\n\nAlso ideally your car.\n\nYou may want to look at prep if you tend to switch orientation in episode. \n\nIn your emergency action plan you'll have this down, but rank local hospitals in terms of where you'd like to be. You may end up extremely far from home, in another country, no way to know, but at least you can try to choose. You should also work w your doc to create a document for ER treatment preferences that you can have on you, they'll know what I'm talking about, it can help, assuming you go through the ER and not jail. The criminal justice system is not like it is on TV re mental health related shenanigans. There really is no mercy re getting out of jail free for being off your gourd, just fyi. Ditto banks, car dealerships, credit cards etc if you get yourself into a ton of debt. Newspaper is a fun one if you really overachieve. Who knows re social media. Who knows re the social media of cruel assholes around you.\n\nNAMI and DBSA for classes and support groups online and off in the US free, also maybe a peer mentor which is a great pair of eyes on you.\n\nPodcasts, videos, books etc for the support network you've got in sidebar. bipolar disorder survival guide, Dr Marks, Polar warriors, inside Bipolar best recs, Ellen Forney's guidebook maybe if they need something easier. memoirs are helpful for them to get a feel for it, kay Redfield Jamison's are popular there are many others, ellens got a graphic novel.\n\nEpisodes tend to get worse the more of them you have, so anything you can do to safety proof your life is a good idea. It's effectively impossible but anything you can think of, do.\n\nDepending on what your job is you may want to quit it in advance. it is highly unethical to practice medicine unmedicated with this disorder.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767960601.0, "id": "nykzlgd", "author": "No_Figure_7489"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "Am I seeking illness?", "text": "To date, I'm diagnosed bipolar and borderline (or rather, showing \"BPD traits\"). In the midst of one of the rockiest periods of my life I was told by a therapist that I was exhibiting BPD traits she wanted to look into as soon as she have me something for the depression. I was instantly given an MDD diagnosis and a prescription of fluoxetine. What followed was nearly two weeks of ramping up. It led to my hospitalisation because at the end of the surge of \"happiness\" I found positive ideation in suicide and tried to follow through. \r\n\r\nThat hospitalisation got me talking to a psychiatrist instead who had me confirm the two-week long period of mania-like telltale signs; barely needing sleep, paranoia about being watched through curtains, a heightened ego which had me thinking I was better than everyone in some way or another despite just leaving a relationship that had me breaking down nearly every day the week prior, ideas and plans for my future, manifestos on how I could transform into my greatest self, and a dangerous anger. Hearing this, the psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bipolar Mood Disorder. This was shortly after starting fluoxetine. The only other time I entered a similar state was when I abruptly stopped treatment, making it two occasions total. The second didn’t result in hospitalisation.\r\n\r\nLamotragine was added to my medicine, along with Quetiapine for sleep. And have been living life with that understanding since. After that incident, my therapist reevaluated my behavior and agreed with the Bipolar diagnosis. What I felt wasn't the relief that other people with the same thing describe after being diagnosed. Just a kind of open acceptance. In the same way I present my degree as just Biochemistry and Chemistry to people who ask instead of EXTENDED Biochemistry and Chemistry (a version of the degree made much easier to qualify for by spacing it out over four instead of the regular three years), I began presenting Bipolar as my diagnosis rather than BPD.\r\n\r\nBut today I saw a different doctor who told me a couple completely different things;\r\n\r\n\t1) None of the medication I've taking was for Bipolar Disorder. Only BPD\r\n\t2) The stability I feel on medication (versus when I stop during brief “I’m cured”/\"I was obviously misdiagnosed\" phases) exists because it’s BPD. If I were bipolar, I “wouldn’t be this stable without medication.”\r\n\t3) Antidepressants have a tendency to cause mania-like symptoms in some people.\r\n\r\nShe concluded with her own separate diagnosis of just BPD.\n\nI can't seek a fourth opinion anytime soon. And what I feel now is a perverse disappointment at this possibility that I'm bipolar-free. I need as many outside thoughts as I can get on this doctor’s take, and maybe some honest reality checks on whether I’m simply looking to be bipolar?\r\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1767929996.0, "id": "1q7xknu", "author": "ImpressiveOutcome774", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q7xknu/am_i_seeking_illness/"}

He also shifts his stance bafflingly, saying it was the drinking (doesn’t cause mania without underlining bipolar), that it was the stimulants (it’d be odd timing), etc. \n\nHe’s the one who told me I had a flight of ideas in sessions. He’s also said what happened was personality in the psychodynamic sense - not BPD. \n\nIt’s getting to be plain invalidating. He’s said I exaggerate things - which I do as a joke or to be cute. I understate my mental health or serious things, usually due to discomfort, which can then make it look like I’m exaggerating since my reaction might seem disproportionate to the event as I described it - but that’s due to me not describing it in a way that actually captures what happened. \n\nUgh.

It was directed at my fiancé and his mother, who have been in my life for eight years (engaged for two). I’m currently completely blocked by both of them.

I noticed clear warning signs — intense chest pressure, feeling trapped, escalating irritability — and I verbally stated that I needed firmer boundaries. At the time, I felt unable to disengage, and the stress felt constant rather than episodic.\n\nI was diagnosed with bipolar I shortly before this relationship began, and for a long time my treatment wasn’t prioritized due to denial and lack of insight. Looking back, I can see how untreated symptoms combined with ongoing interpersonal stress made this episode more severe.\n\nIt’s been over a week with no contact. I’m emotionally indifferent, but I still feel residual anger and physical agitation, even though the intensity has decreased.\n\nI’m trying to understand the aftermath of episodes like this, not justify what happened.

Personally 2,5mg doesn't feel like enough for me. It doesn't keep my sleep schedule in line. But 5mg is usually perfect. But sometimes, a few times a year, some hypomania/irritability will start up and I'll go up to 7.5 or 10 for a week, maybe two or three, until it settles down. Your mood doesn't stay the same. Why should your dose?  Ask for your doctor's permission to vary your dose yourself. \n\nYou have to get good at spotting an episode and dealing with it. Start mood tracking, not just checking a box, but write a little mini-journal about possible symptoms, so you get good at spotting a mood shift. And sleep tracking. For me the most obvious thing is sleep. My psychiatrist said if I wasn't getting at least six hours sleep for more than a couple nights that might be the start of an episode. Another thing I notice is irritability, especially towards people who put their feet on the seats on the subway or homeless people being obnoxious and dysfunctional. If an episode is starting I get much closer to confronting them about it. \"You have to catch it early or it snowballs\" my psychiatrist said.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "I sympathize and empathize.  I too am high energy, and sleep is not natural for me even without drugs.  I anm very much into eating good foods and am very physically healthy.  Except for the swimming in the ocean (nice!), poetry, making jewelry, etc., I could’ve written what you said about sleep.  \n\nFrom my own personal experience and I’m not making any recommendation, things improved tremendously for me when I focused on sleep quality over quantity. it sounds obvious, but for me it involved significant changes.  I use wearables (3 of them!) and Whoop has been the most helpful for my sleep.  I focused on measures of sleep fragmentation like sleep efficiency and sleep stress. They were terrible even when I was able to sleep long hours, whether by happenstance or by sedative. I felt awful, like you. I did lots of research. I found that - precisely because I’m high energy - quetiapine is a bad sedative for me.  It destroyed my sleep quality even while giving me more hours. Trazadone was worse for me. In fact, because my blood pressure is really good but on the low side, no sedative really works for me. I was trying to push my body into something unnatural for it.\n\nSo I have to sleep with my natural energy level.  I didn’t change my diet much, but I did learn that I needed to reorder things and make sure I was getting good low-glycemic carbs for slow glucose release and fewer cortisol spikes through the night. Histamine was a big one for me. I have to be careful with fish, leftovers, and fermented foods. (It’s unbelievable how many high histamine or histamine-signalling foods there are.) Protein too close to bedtime is histamine-signaling, so my big meal is now lunch. When I’m consistent, my sleep quality is excellent. When I waver, it suffers. These are objective numbers from my wearables, so they are not based solely on how I feel.  My quantity wavers too and this matters, but I’ve learned this wasn’t the main driver of how I feel.\n\n  \nThe upshot is that I do far better on 3 hours of good quality, non-fragmented sleep than on 7 hours with fragmentation. Thise are extremes - really I sleep about 4.5 hours per night My resting heart rate and HRV, which are excellent, agree and show this is sustainable.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "The more episodes you have the harder it is to medicate, the more meds you'll need to control it and for half of us the worse it can get (less time well, episodes more severe, episodes occurring without triggers which tends to start around episode 4, more mixed, more depression, cognitive damage is possible). If you want to be off meds the thing to do is medicate and be completely stable for five years, that gives your brain time to heal from the damage and become more robust, they'll taper you off very slowly, and then see. 10% of people with BP, and that's a higher percentage with BP1, can go five years without an episode meds or not, so it may not mean it's actual stability, but you can try. The first six months after an episode are the most critical to medicate bc at that point you are most likely to bounce back up into an episode. You'll want an emergency action plan of course, WRAP has great templates, and your life to be in a place where mania reoccurring will cause minimal damage, which usually means trained people around you, increased medical monitoring, etc. Bipolar is a med treated disorder, it is recurring, I was forced off meds bc nothing worked and am now in continuous mixed state and have cognitive damage. If you've not had mixed state it's usually described as wanting to claw your way out of your body with your own hands. It is of course up to you.\n\nAfter an upswing you usually experience what they'll call a depression, I do not consider aspects of it to be under that label but that's the term. The guilt/shame bit is both based on behavior but also I think a symptom. the cognitive effects are the last to resolve, including things like anhedonia, it can take years per episode, it varies by person and at least in my case increased with time. hopefully you have a therapist and are in a BP support group, DBSA and NAMI in the US online and off, they also have classes for friends and family, support groups for them, books for them, and peer mentors in many places for you. books, videos, podcasts etc in sidebar, inside Bipolar podcast being very good for the med hunt and basics. education on this is very DIY and very important. If you decide to gamble, you need to learn absolutely everything you can about it in order to keep yourself as safe as possible, and you need to educate everyone around you. Bringing family and friends into your psych appts for education is a good idea, as is couples counseling if that applies. You'll need to train them up. Often early signs are not detectable by us due to lack of insight, an early to kick in symptom that is not denial, so do not rely only on yourself. Lack of insight can increase with time. You need to be extremely aggressive about IDing it early and getting yourself into the hospital ASAP bc if you do not medicate you will not know what works, and may not be able to control it outpatient as its easier to prevent than stop. Work with your therapist on this plan. Subsequent episodes have a tendency to be worse. Medications that did work can fail.\n\nYou'll want to look at social rhythm therapy, there's a book on it out now for BP and your psych team will be familiar, avoid all substances most likely including caffeine, we cannot tolerate sleep quality disruption, and be very vigilant.

I had major dental surgery followed by the most stressful work life I've ever experienced. I had been on medical leave due to bipolar for six months in 2024, and, when I returned, they started trying to push me out. Add onto that year end (accounting), I was unstable. \n\nI don't remember a lot of the specifics around then, but, towards the end of 2024 and through the beginning of 2025, I had quite a few episodes of binge drinking. I would be sick for a day or two afterward, then my mood would spiral even more. When I posted here, I genuinely did not remember that bit of my life until someone pointed out an older post of mine in a different subreddit. \n\nSo, as far as screw ups are concerned, accidentally lying on the internet is pretty small, but I wanted to call out my fuck up because I have a problem with guilt. :) Cool story, yeah?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767817590.0, "id": "1q6qmie", "author": "doljumptantalum", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q6qmie/i_screwed_up/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "Bipolar Mixed Mania\n\nI figured I would write down how my mixed mania presents because people ask about mixed episodes so often. Mixed mania can also be called dysphoric mania. Classic mania tends to be euphoric in nature. \n\nWhen I’m in a mixed episode I have this terrible restless energy (agitation), I want to climb the walls and I can’t be in my own skin. I cannot do anything productive with this energy. There is even a panic quality to it like I’m in a dark pit and water is rushing in from all sides and there is no way out. The biggest thing I want to express is that agitation can feel a LOT like anxiety if you’ve never experienced it. Everything kind of grates on my nerves too. Like I’m irritable so I tend to isolate a lot so I don’t take it out on other people. I know some people will report they experience rage too but I don’t get that bad. \n\nI also have really bad depressive qualities, lots of intrusive suicidal thoughts and thoughts about how I’m a burden and everyone would be better off if I was gone. I tend to start self harming to keep from attempting suicide. Typically, if it gets to that point I have to go into a higher level of care or I become a danger to myself. \n\nHope that helps if you’re questioning whether your mania is mixed.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767846098.0, "id": "nyc8mlp", "author": "butterflycole"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "Over the years I've experienced quite a few moderate mixed episodes and then a couple more severe mixed episodes with delusions where I nearly ended my life.\n\nIt's difficult to describe because I feel a lot of confusion during these episodes but I'll try.\n\nFor the moderate mixed episodes, it basically feels like moderate depression and moderate hypomania combined. I feel like I'm not interested in anything really, want to stay in bed, mood is generally low, constant extremely high anxiety, feeling the need to do something constantly despite not wanting to, racing thoughts about bad things but trying to do positive things desperately to feel better, difficulty sitting still so I appear quite active but restless, getting around 5 hours sleep (my normal is 9 hours), extreme confusion and derealization, impulsive thoughts and ideas like running away for a road trip to \"just get away\" and going to a random distant village bar, then go camping in a forest to write poetry about how life feels unbearable. In these moderate mixed episodes I do not show rapid pressured speech, so I might appear active and restless to others but remain very quiet because I still feel quite depressed. Not depressed enough to have suicidal thoughts either, which is probably the only reason I say it's moderate.\n\nFor the more severe \"classic\" mixed episodes, for me it feels like severe depression and full blown mania combined. These episodes have been the most painful experiences of my entire life. I feel extremely hopeless and apathetic, it's like there's no color in anything, I can't grasp it and even if there were color, I wouldn't care. Even listening to music makes me overwhelmed and disgusted (which is extremely abnormal to me). I think about suicide constantly and the issue is that now I experience racing thoughts and they're so fast that most of it I can't grasp or recognize except the hopelessness and suicidal thoughts. Because the thoughts are so fast I don't understand who I am or what the world is anymore because all I'm experiencing is a confusing tornado at lightspeed inside. There's extreme anxiety to the point where it feels like a panic attack constantly, it hurts phyiscally. I sleep 0-2 hours a night. Can't sit still, pace around 5 hours straight just to calm down... it might work for a minute and I'll pace again. I don't do anything, except just pace around and try not to follow through with the suicidal thoughts... \"I need to do something, I have to figure stuff out but I feel absolutely so hopeless, depressed and apathetic that I just can't and don't want to do anything, everything is useless, I can't live anymore, I hate myself so much, why am I so fucking useless and worthless?\" I might be able to think to myself among the extremely confusing racing thoughts. All I want to do is lay in bed motioneless for days like with severe depression but it's just not possible, because for some reason the agitation is so intense that the anxiety would be even worse if I tried to force myself to lay down. Then as the days go by, I start having delusions about suicide, I'm not going to get into it here in detail but basically \"the universe wants me dead and has been showing signs\" etc. Then, after another max 2 hour sleep, one night I figure it's impossible to live like this and I drive next to the railway tracks and wait for a train and end it right there by getting run over. But I got involuntarily hospitalized instead. This was last summer and my most recent mixed episode. They gave me high dose olanzapine for a few weeks and I got better day by day. Moral of the story, get help as soon as you start becoming unwell, especially when it's a mixed episode.\n\nEdit: During the more severe mixed episodes I also seem to exhibit more manic symptoms externally, compared to moderate mixed episode where they appear more depressed. During the severe mixed episodes I'm restless and agitated but also talk constantly if someone is around, quite fast but not nearly as fast as during euphoric mania.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1767759353.0, "id": "ny54dcg", "author": "WaltzInTheDarkk"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "Hey friend, it's a delicate situation, isn't it? Too delicate perhaps for Reddit opinions, to be honest.\n\nBut to start, let's get rid of the word \"crazy\" for a bit? We're all people with mental disorders on this subreddit, but we're looking for a good life and stability. It's just part of life, you know? It's not a shame to need help sometimes, remember that.\n\nMaybe you're in crisis right now, and don't take my words as aggression. Just think along with me, okay? The people who are by your side, do you trust them? Do you love them? Do you think they would lie to you? Your partner, do you think they wouldn't be honest with you? Even when everything seems absolutely true in our heads, in all the decisions of our lives we need to take a step back and take into consideration some things around us. If I only believed in myself, I would never have started my medication, I would never have realized my mania was in a manic phase, do you understand that? It's not about disbelieving your feelings, but about believing in the people who are close to you, in your support network, you understand that. At no point am I judging the reality of these feelings for you, and I imagine how scary it must be. I also hear voices in crisis, and I think they're behind me. Who? I don't know, but I feel they are. But you need to breathe and, as much as possible, get your head in the right place, can you understand me? Don't call yourself crazy, you're not.\n\n\nIt's important that you understand that there are things that escape the space of our minds, and reality sometimes takes shape in ways that unfortunately are not restricted to what we see or hear, or feel. It's important that you understand that the people you trust only want to protect you, and that you talk to your partner, trying to make it clear how you feel about this. And another thing, medications don't prevent 100% of crises; they can stop working during stressful or atypical times, and they can also stop working simply because, sometimes you need to make changes related to different antipsychotics. But remember, all of this is normal; bipolar people constantly need to add or subtract medications throughout their lives.\n\nI wish you well, and I hope this phase passes. Don't be afraid of getting better, don't be afraid to admit that maybe you're a little out of your own mind. Being afraid to admit the supposed \"madness\" will only distance you from the ideal course of action, which is to reconnect with yourself and stabilize without these scary things chasing you. Avoid leaving home alone; it's dangerous. Even if you're sure of the reality of the facts, you agree that it's still dangerous, right? I hope so. Take care, OP, I'm rooting for you.", "score": 32, "created_utc": 1767756081.0, "id": "ny4v799", "author": "Trianguloamarelo"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "\n\nHey, I have bipolar too - mine looks a bit different but I recognize where you're at right now. I'd honestly suggest going to the hospital now if that's possible, but if you really need to wait until morning, that's okay too. Here's the thing: making yourself as comfortable as possible until then is actually the most important thing you can do right now.\n\nWhat you're experiencing is absolutely real to you - and that doesn't make you crazy. You have a neurological condition and your nervous system is having a really hard time right now. It's the same way someone with diabetes might need to go to the hospital even when they're taking their meds every day because their body reacted differently and produced too much insulin. Your nervous system has reacted more intensely today, and that's not your fault. You have a more sensitive system that responds harder to stress, histamine, sleep disruption, all of it - and sometimes it just tips over.\n\nThe fact that what you're experiencing feels real to you but not to the people around you doesn't mean either of you are wrong - it means your nervous system is picking up on things differently right now, which is why they're concerned. And honestly? You're really lucky to be surrounded by people who care enough to want to take you to the hospital. There is zero shame in letting them love you like this.\n\nBefore you go, if you can: try to take 10 minutes away from all stimulation. Grab every comforter in your house and make yourself a weighted blanket situation. Just let yourself have a break from all of this for a few minutes - you deserve that. And if you can get down even a bite of protein and some electrolyte water, that'll help you feel more grounded. Magnesium supplements really help me in this mode. I know it might seem weird but it really does help.\n\nI'm medication resistant myself, and there were definitely times where if someone who cared about me could've taken me somewhere safe where I could get something to quiet the spinning thoughts and the anxiety for even just a few hours so I could rest, I would've taken it. I raw dogged it and I'm lucky I made it through. Ketosis saved me. You have people who want to help you - that's actually a gift.\n\nThere's nothing to fix right now. Your nervous system is just having a tough time and needs some support to settle down. That's all this is.\n\nIt's totally okay to make yourself a blanket pillow fort until it's time to go get the medical support - like if it'll help, absolutely make yourself a blanket monster with some nice refreshing electrolyte water or sparkling water. Sparkling water is really nice when I'm in this state. When you're not sleeping it's so easy to forget to hydrate and it makes such a huge difference. Magnesium honestly sometimes feels like the best thing for me - it's the electrolyte I'm often depleted in and it can be so soothing, like the xanax of electrolytes honestly. So if you have any of those tools, use them. I just highly recommend making yourself a blanket fort until you can get the medical support that you need.\n\nAnd if the spiders are still bugging you, it's okay to make them their own blanket fort that's separate from yours. Sometimes it works. \n\nGood luck! Sending love! You got this! 🫂🤹", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1767780990.0, "id": "ny6ccuf", "author": "ArtistStunning2996"}

I’m terrified my meds have ruined this part of me forever.\n\nBecause of my meds I’m also no longer as emotional. I’m no longer as intelligent.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "I believe you're already bordering on mania again (if you aren't already). I understand every word you said, friend, I also miss being \"more creative,\" with \"more personality,\" \"more witty,\" \"more self-assured,\" more, more, more. That's what mania is, the \"more\"! Being invincible, unbeatable, infallible, a god. But for how long?\n\nThink about the context in which you started taking your medication. It's sweet to look at the past with maniacal eyes, but think rationally. Who starts taking medication in the first place when they're doing well? What led you to take it, after all? The psychoses? For me, it was the increasing psychotic crises of mania. What's the point of having heightened spirituality and always being on the verge of chaos, of breaking, of putting yourself at risk? Nothing helps.\n\nI also think about stopping my medication, sometimes I do, but I always go back. It's frustrating not being able to be a normal human being without these medications, I know. But you have them, science has made all this evolution and now with them you can live without breaking down, and isn't that great? I know that normal life after half a lifetime or more in the instability of bipolar disorder seems boring. For artists, this hurts, the lack of \"creativity\" resulting from sadness and outbursts is almost cruel (it's no coincidence that most famous artists of the past killed themselves or had some disorder, I feel that creativity is very linked to mental disorders many times. But remember, many killed themselves or lived miserable lives). Anyway, advice from a fellow sufferer, take your medication and control this manic onset. I know you feel like a free god, or you will feel that way, but this will pass and you end up remembering why you started taking it in the first place.\n\n\nAvoid developing resistance to medications that work, take them regularly and drink plenty of water.

I’m excited for you with the path you’ve paved for yourself. \n\nI also love that you have a connection to a belief system that’s larger than yourself and life. I think it can be so important for humans to have something they can truly believe in and find a sense of purpose in.\n\nI can relate to the frustration of how meds can seem to dampen things I’ve come to love about myself / embrace as my identity. I do think it’s important for me (and maybe you, who am I to say) to remember that there are many treatment options that may be a better fit.\n\nAfter I’ve had manic episodes, my ideas and actions that seem so big and important and exciting and beautiful — I look back and see them through a different lens. \n\nI recently watched a youtube video that helped explain mania. Our brains fire high amounts of dopamine in response to things that are inconsequential, and when our brains normally DO see consequential things, they do fire big dopamine bc it IS important for us to pay attention. It’s possible, right now, your brain is getting big “PAY ATTENTION” and “THIS IS IMPORTANT / IT” and “THIS IS RELATED TO X/Y/Z (things that also misfired big dopamine).”\n\nMaybe not, but if you do want to shift your life like this, I believe you owe it to yourself to take it in steps - give yourself pauses so you can see it from the lens when you’re medicated and feel more stable (albeit less like the way you’re enjoying now). You don’t have to commit to abandoning this path, but doing it in one fell swoop might hinder you from doing it the best way for *you.* \n\nAll parts of you are important and valid, and abandoning the idea of all meds and going full force might take you down a path that *looks* like the one you want, but the trajectory might get shifted to a bad direction if you don’t let stable-you have intermittent looksies. If it’s the right path, taking a pause to get a diff vantage point before continuing won’t make it all disappear. \n\nAgain, I want to celebrate the great things you’ve done recently, and I do believe you deserve to feel like yourself, and full of life. I think that’s definitely possible, and I don’t think this exact game plan is the only way (nor is it fair to the part of you that’s worked so hard to get you to such an amazing place).\n\nI hope you continue on these great life developments - and that my words are, in some way, helpful (saying to you what I’d say to myself if I wrote your post).", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1767748179.0, "id": "ny4723n", "author": "Mozart33"}

I’m not sure what your specific faith is, but in my humble opinion, tapping into spirituality through mania isn’t helpful for people like us. You’re more open to dangerous energies that way and thoughts that aren’t coming from yourself. Or a benevolent energy either. \n\nAs far as your emotions and creativity, I’m not sure when you were diagnosed. I noticed that for people that were diagnosed in adulthood even young adulthood tend to have this perspective. Those emotions and creativity don’t come from a real/focused space. I’m personally a creative. My best art comes out when I am stable. No mania no depression. Blunted emotions/depression is common after mania.

I wonder if you read this to your therapist if they could help you apply CBT to these thought patterns to change your mindset. If a therapist isn't a good fit, sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right therapist.\n\n\n\"I will probably never be able to become who I want to ideally be in life because of my bipolar\" \n\n\nIt is certainly hard grieving and accepting that life won't look like what you'd hoped, which is a very human experience. Life throws in some unexpected turns for everyone. \nThe ideal might need to change, but I try to focus on the ways that change can be for the best. I can't have the career path I initially wanted, but that's okay, because what I'm doing now and is more exciting than my original plan.\n\n\nTypically, I don't think the bar needs to be set lower. It just may require a different bar and it may take longer. Just really focus on reaching stability through meds, therapy, sleep hygiene, positive relationships, stress management, coping skills, nutrition, exercise, routine, fun, etc...

This is being used for emotional dysregulation  sudden loss of control, intense anger/rage episodes, and self-harm behaviors during those episodes.

I keep seeing very polarized experiences online some people say Abilify was weight-neutral, others report significant gain and I’m trying to understand what’s most realistic at low doses, especially with a high activity level.\n\nSpecific questions:\n\n\t•\tFor people who’ve taken low doses (2–4 mg), how common was noticeable weight gain?\n\n\t•\tDoes weight change tend to come from appetite increases rather than metabolic slowing?\n\n\t•\tHave any athletic or very active people remained lean on Abilify long-term?\n\n\t•\tAre there early warning signs (increased hunger, cravings, etc.) that showed up before weight changes?\n\n\t•\tDid titrating from 2 mg to 4 mg make a noticeable difference in appetite or body composition?\n\nI’m taking this medication because the emotional episodes are genuinely unsafe for me, and I’m committed to staying active and eating well.

Your psychiatrist has to determine if the concerns you have brought up are due to a comorbidity of bipolar and ADHD (which is very common) or just the bipolar or something else altogether.  Doing that in one or two visits is pretty difficult, unless it is a clear cut case.  \n\nIn the meantime, make a concrete list of the tasks that executive functioning gets in the way of currently.  Not the symptom (eg not inattention) but the very basic task (e.g. hanging coat in closet).  Track how often you are doing those things as treatment continues.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "2 weeks into my treatment: Progress report! :D", "text": "I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type-1 back in October. It came as a surprise, because I was really just getting my base medical records at the mental health center I go to updated. Suddenly, a lot of my more manic behaviors were making a lot more sense in retrospect. I never had like impulsive life-changing actions, but I can be quite the motormouth and my insomnia is so bad that I can go up to five days without sleep. We've begun a treatment plan for my Bi-Polar Type 1. I was prescribed medication and have begun regular therapy sessions.\n\nThe first three days consisted of my body adjusting to it. This meant ravenous appetite, overheating (something not helped by the fact my boyfriend is a southerner and insists on keeping the house at boiling temperatures during the winter), and an uptick in my depression. But it seems to have evened out by day 5. Now, while the ravenous appetite remains, I'm no longer overheating and my depression has lessened.\n\nThe positives have been immense. I'm annoying my boyfriend with my manic rambling far less, instead keeping my sharing of things to truly interesting tidbits and keeping them more concise too. I'm making inappropriate jokes a lot less, showing actual restraint for once. We were worried I would stop being so vivacious, but I appear to still be enthusiastic even without the manic episodes. My executive dysfunction has been a bit better. My mood has been far stabler. Even when I start to dwell on bad experiences in my past, they pass far quicker than before, and I feel less impulse to go seek out the things that hurt me in the past to fixate on them. For the first time, I'm truly letting go of my memories of pain.\n\nI was already in long-term therapy for complex-PTSD and we've already added my Bi-Polar Type 1 to my ongoing treatment plan. So far, the therapy sessions are going well, as we've combined them to treat them both in the same sessions!\n\nOne unexpected benefit is that my new Bipolar meds really knock me out. The result is that for the first time in my life, my chronic insomnia has lessened and I'm actually experiencing a regular, diurnal sleep schedule. It's shocking, like... Me, diurnal? The world isn't ready! XD\n\nInterestingly, my new Bipolar meds and my ADHD meds act as balancers to each other, giving me many benefits but lessening the potential downsides of both. It's an unexpected benefit that even my therapist didn't see coming. Yay! :D\n\nAnd Bipolar Reddit has been so kind and accepting.

A kid will make everything you are describing immensely more challenging and it does not sound like you are in the financial position for it. It will be hard on you, hard on your marriage, and hard on the kid. Again, its a tough conversation, i'm not minimizing that at all.\n\nI would move to the two bedroom. Imho the space makes an enormous difference in quality of life. At minimum move to somewhere with either a W/D or dishwasher for the same reasons.  My husband works from home so the second bedroom is his office. I also have a gaming set up in there so we can spend quality time via parallel play. Its great.\n\nThe second bedroom would also allow you to at least periodically have a family member stay with you. That being said. Another thing I recommend is doing some work in therapy on you NOT being responsible for your parents and extended family. This is also hard, especially if you have a cultural background where its standard for multiple generations to live closely. But their livelihood is an immense weight that makes everything feel more hopeless. You can empathize with them and provide support to the extent it does not detract from your own wellbeing.\n\nIf at all possible, I would also look into a position with more job security. You are clearly hard working, intelligent, and capable and deserve a position that recognizes this. People like us (with mental illness and traumatic backgrounds) really benefit from the security. It too makes a wild difference in quality of life. I turned down several possible career paths for this reason and did some real work this year on understanding why I will likely have to stay where I am (which is a great workplace where I am valued and do interesting work but with limited salary potential).\n\nWould love to chat more with you.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "Help with advocating for myself on medication", "text": "Hi, I am 26F. Since 2022, I have consistently been on quetiapine and lamotragine. i haven’t had a manic episode (though i have BPII, and only really have 2 major manic periods that i can recall, the rest being majorly depressive). however, the meds haven’t really helped me lose the fatigue that came with the depression and i think the seroquel (quetiapine) is making it worse. i also have been gaining weight despite trying not to and it’s impacting my sense of self and overall health - my dad is diabetic, which runs in my family, and last year when i weighed LESS than i do now, i was told i was close to being considered pre-diabetic. despite being moderately active and being conscious of what food i eat, i now weigh more and stepping on a scale or going clothing shopping feels like a humiliation ritual which is bringing me feelings of emotional insecurity and depressed headspace (SI &amp; SH thoughts included). these emotions and thoughts are only exacerbated by the lack of energy and motivation i feel regularly. i have the urges to be productive and do things, but feel so tired that i can barely lift my head (this happens even when i don’t feel depressed in the traditional, suicidal sense if this makes sense). i got put on zepbound recently which helped, but my primary and my insurance are disagreeing on appropriate dosage at the current stage and are kind of at an impasse so i’ve been off it for two weeks, and my primary honestly hedged on prescribing it originally because she personally recommended going off the quetiapine for long-term results in the areas of not only weight gain, but chronic fatigue. i quit smoking nicotine and weed regularly a long time ago, almost two years for the weed and almost a year for nicotine. now i occasionally will do one or the other socially when visiting friends or family out of state(like 2-3 times a year). i barely ever drink unless i’m having a night out with friends or my husband. and yet, these things almost seem to have INCREASED the symptoms i have been dealing with. \n\nthe seroquel doesn’t help me sleep the way it used to, yet leaves me feeling hungover and tired throughout the day. \n\nnow - my primary is very much of the idea that i should taper off the quet or at least go low enough to a dose that is weight stable ( which atp is less of an anti-psychotic and more of a sleeping aid). \n\ni had been on 400 mg LAM and we went down to 200 last year, which was mildly helpful. my psychiatric med provider disagrees heavily with my primary, thinks i should remain on the seroquel at 300mg(after our last convo, she agreed to go down to 275 but still thinks that isn’t enough). and due to living in a rural area, i only get to see my actual\n\npsychiatrist like once every six months, which is starting to feel impractical and unhelpful. and honestly? i’ve had those two manic episodes, yes, but not severe ones - they harbored many of the hallmarks of a typical ME, lasting for days to weeks &amp; including feelings of grandiosity, lack of impulse control, decreased sleeping and eating with increased energy output, heightened emotions and anxiety, etc but one consistent thing i have never experienced is hallucinations or thinking i was god or being spoken to by god. and after those episodes i typically go into a month or two where i feel “normal” for lack of better terms - productive, not constantly drained, not having suicidal thoughts or ideations - and then slip back into depression, which generally lasts significantly longer than either of the aforementioned episodes, typically 3-4 months. my psych is considering the possibility of ADHD or autism over BPII, or both or coexisting with the BPII. i am also diagnosed with BPD, CPTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder. I feel like at this point i am getting pretty tired of having a laundry list of psychiatric diagnoses and i am equally tired of the side effects of the medications. though they have helped lessen the severity of my depression and have prevented me from having any other manic episodes, i don’t have that feeling that these are helping me the way they’re supposed to help most people and the side effects feel like more of a hindrance than anything else. and more importantly, i am really tired of the entities/people who are supposed to be helping me disagreeing with each other to the point where it destabilizes my treatment plan at times (insurance has pulled this shit with other things - migraine meds, other psychiatric meds). my med provider and GP don’t seem like they’re budging on their individual opinions any time soon. it’s confusing and disheartening and i feel like i can’t properly advocate for myself when i’m being told one thing or another by the professionals who are supposed to be helping me feel in control of my life. it’s so tempting to quit cold turkey and go back to the baseline and work back up from there but i know that isn’t necessarily a safe or healthy idea. \n\nnote, i have tried multiple other meds before coming to these two and i have migraines and reynaud’s disease, which symptoms can be worsened by anything, including meds, that impacts your circulatory system. i also want kids, so it was important to me to choose meds that shouldn’t impact my ability to have kids long term (i do understand i would need to go off lamotragine during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but that isn’t the concern regarding fertility). so suffice to say, we have done trial and error and any traditional or commonly used medication that hasn’t been tried was because my med providers strongly felt those meds would counteract with meds used for treating migraines &amp; the symptoms of reynaud’s in some manner, or impact my fertility. \n\nat one point, i was struggling with feeling fatigued yet having sleeping issues so we tried sleeping meds (trazadone &amp; zolpidem). both made me sleep like the dead, but i started sleepwalking on the zolpidem &amp; both worsened the feelings of chronic fatigue and hangover symptoms). now i take all my psych meds at night since they’re going to make me more tired regardless (my providers are fine with this - when i first started, my previous providers told me to take LAM/SER in the AM) and that helps a tiny bit but it isn’t a breakthrough solution. \n\nsorry for the long ass rant but how do y’all navigate your BPII diagnoses? how about conflict with your medical providers? (i know insurance is going to be problematic no matter what lol. thanks america) how do you feel like you can advocate for yourselves when these kinds of conflicts arise? how do you identify or convey your thoughts and feelings to your providers in a way that isn’t undermining their professional and educational experience or seeming unstable? (i am kind of convinced my med provider thinks i am sliding towards a manic episode and that’s why she feels how she does about going off the quetiapine, but i personally don’t think i am unstable like that). and any other advice or stories you have, i think i just need people to relate to. the only other people i know that are bipolar are my dad and his siblings and for various reasons, conversations with them on this matter never really leave me feeling confident or understood. \n\ni feel so sad and frustrated. i just want to live my life not feeling like i have to physically drag myself through each day - even when i am truly excited or happy to be doing whatever i am doing. i am exhausted and burnt out of feeling so burned out. i want to be productive without it feeling heavily taxing. i want to want a family and children without being conflicted about my ability to potentially care for them. i watched my mom struggle with depression and fatigue and chronic illness my whole life, and watching your parent sleep both your lives away is no way for a kid to live. i want to LIVE. period. i am not depressed, i don’t think of suicide the way i used to, but i hate how much i want to live and how limited i feel by being. so. tired. and i really, really wish i could better identify what is ME and my body chemistry, and what is medication and what the right recourse for this is, and it would be nice if i felt like i could adequately advocate my concerns in a dr appt without feeling steamrolled.\n\nthanks for coming to my ted talk", "score": 2, "num_comments": 22, "created_utc": 1767671785.0, "id": "1q584pd", "author": "greentmochii", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q584pd/help_with_advocating_for_myself_on_medication/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "There’s a few reasons residential may benefit a person. One is that, since you’re under constant supervision and don’t have any actual responsibilities you need to be functional for, you can start, discontinue, and/or titrate meds more aggressively than what you’d do in outpatient. \n\nSecond is related to the lack of responsibility aforesaid. Since you aren’t really “doing anything,” you can do things like take strong, sedating doses of old fashioned APs, which can quickly dissolve a mixed episode. Except you don’t want to do that outpatient, because that’s not really compatible with adult life.\n\nFor this reason alone, I’d consider going inpatient if I get a mixed state again. They can just slap the episode down with stronger med cocktails than you’d use outpatient. And then when that’s accomplished, you transition to a healthier maintenance regimen.\n\nFinally, it’s just a low stress environment. You aren’t working. You’re not caring for family if you do that. You have literally nothing anybody is depending on you to do. That loss of stress can be super therapeutic.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "Medicated, hypo, and need to share", "text": "I have friends to talk about this with, but I hate burdening them with my shit when they have their own stuff, especially when I'm just hypo. I still feel the need to share, though, which is typical for me during hypo episodes. I'm not really looking for anything specific -- maybe someone relating, or reassurance, or just being seen.\n\nMedication info: I'm medicated and have been adequately medicated for probably around 10-12 months, give or take. I did have a break-through depressive episode 2 months ago, but my psych gave me an emergency lithium script which nipped that in the bud. Due to insurance and financial issues, I cannot see my psych again until February. \n\nI'm getting married in a week and a half. Awesome, right? I'm 40, this is my first marriage, and it's to a man I'm wildly in love with and who I've known since high school (we reconnected during 2020). I had accepted that I would never get married about 6 years ago; I just figured, you know, some people do that, others don't, and it wasn't going to happen for me. Then, in November, we decided that getting married was the right decision for us. We're doing a small, casual wedding with just family (they're all out of state), and friends (local) will join us for a casual reception afterward. It's all happening very quickly. \n\nOver this past weekend, I had so much energy; I got so much done around the house (preparing for family to be over), and didn't think anything of it. Then, last night, I couldn't sleep -- I just felt like I was dozing all night. This is SUPER unusual for me: even when I've been hypo before I was on mood stabilizers, I rarely miss sleep because of my AAP. Today, I'm in the best mood I've been in in a while -- bubbly and outgoing and happy (not euphoric, thank goodness), not tired in the slightest despite barely sleeping. \n\nI knew, I KNEW, that the wedding would put me in a hypo episode. I still have about 2.5 weeks of the lithium script left, and I was planning on starting that in a week. I'm thinking I should probably go ahead and start in a few days, though, if this keeps up. I can't ask for another script until February, so if I have another break through ep in that time, I'm pretty much fucked. \n\nI don't know. I feel so good, even though I logically know it's definitely bad mental-health-wise and brain-wise, I feel like I \"deserve\" to feel like this. I've waited so long and thought it would never happen. I've been through the mill with abusive partners, others who weren't emotionally available, and just generally bad luck in love in ways that severely traumatized me, and to have finally found a good, reliable, available, attentive partner who adores me... it feels like I've hit the jackpot. I know that being hypo isn't a \"reward,\" but my head is telling me: why can't I just enjoy the hypo as a lil treat? \n\nIt's amazing and it sucks. I'm going to start the lithium tomorrow, maybe the next day. I know I can't stay like this. I just... I just want to enjoy my wedding and the time leading up to it as much as I can. Forcibly bringing myself back down to earth feels like I'm raining on my own parade so to speak.\n\nAnyway. I just needed to get that out.\n\nI hope you all are doing well and having a great, stable week. &lt;3", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767639884.0, "id": "1q4uqk3", "author": "naturaldrpepper", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q4uqk3/medicated_hypo_and_need_to_share/"}

I know opinions are very divided — some people feel antidepressants should never be used in bipolar disorder, while others believe they can be appropriate if a mood stabiliser and/or antipsychotic is in place.\n\nPersonally, I was on sertraline (Zoloft) for around 8 months prior to my diagnosis. I was stable for most of that time, and symptoms of mania didn’t appear until much later, which coincided with substance use (something I believe played a significant role in triggering my episode).\n\nCurrently, I’m on Abilify and Lamotrigine. While Lamotrigine has helped somewhat, it hasn’t lifted my depression in the same way sertraline did. My psychiatrist is firmly against trialling an antidepressant again, even alongside a mood stabiliser and antipsychotic. However, I would really like to trial it again.\n\nI’m curious to hear others’ experiences:\n- Are you for or against antidepressants in bipolar disorder?\n- Do you have Bipolar I or II?\n- Are you currently on an antidepressant?\n- If so, are you also on a mood stabiliser and/or antipsychotic?\n- Has it been helpful or problematic for you?\n\nI’m not looking for medical advice, just real experiences.

The cocktail varied, but I never really got the depression symptom relief no matter which med combo we tried, but of all the antidepresants I liked wellbutrin XL the most, but even that eventually seemed to not help and I started having labs effected by the wellbutrin. \n\nThen I read \"The Depression Cure, The 6-Step Program to Beat Depression Without Drugs\" by Dr Stephen S. Ilardi (cites studies to support fixing low D3, correcting omega6 to omega3 imbalance, and every other suggestion have studies to support it)\n\nI showed the book to my psychiatrist and he was supportive as I wanted to try some of the books suggestions. I checked my vitamin D3 and it was low (most of us are), fixing my low D3 had the surprising effect of solving my years of chronic exhaustion, I found out later that is because D3 regulates serotonin production and also circadian rhythum, two key issues for bipolar. Vitamin D3 also is critical for the body to convert thyroid hormone T4 to thyroid hormone T3, and since people with bipolar have a genetic mutation that effects the D2 enzyme that converts thyroid T4 to T3, we are already at a disadvantage in thyroid hormone conversion leaving tissues starved of T3, and this massively contributes to depression (it’s a hypothyroid symptom) and blood serum T3 may be normal and thyroid function able to make plenty of T4, yet the brain still starved of T3 due to the mutation and then low D3 further exacerbates this.\n\nI also corrected my omega6 to omega3 imbalance first with supplements and now entirely through diet following the protocols of dual board certified in psychiatry and neurology dr Brooke Goldner. \n\nI worked with my counseling dr to conquer negative rumination and gain control of my thoughts, challening my negative self talk and reprogramming my sub-conscience with postitive affirmations. \n\nI exercised regularly (outperforms antidepressanta in studies). \n\nAt that point I was able to taper off my anti-depressant (wellbutrin XL) and within a few years in 2017 I was able to taper off my remaining psych med cocktail. I did other things since, prioritizing self care and sleep, the help of a psychiatric service dog, and many other mental health tools I gained in counseling. I have been psych med free and stayed out of the psych ward since 2017. \n\nIn 2022 I was finally diagnosed with hypothyroidism, with end stage hashimoto’s antibody destruction to my thyroid which took 20 years (thanks seroquel!, which causes central hypothyroid in 50% of patients but can also cause hashimoto’s which is primary hypothyroid), and I also have central hypothyroid. We are still, 3 years later, trying to get my thyroid hormone replacement dose sorted, because of the previously mentioned mutation I need a T4/T3 combo med (Armour Thyroid) but it’s hard to get adaquate dosing because central hypothyroid supresses TSH when meds are added which makes most dr think they need to stop increasing the dose, when they need to keep slowing adjusting up until symptom relief, we have to go slowly because too much T3 and that triggers mania. Hypothyroid causes depression, hyperthyroid causes psychosis. It’s a delicate balance. \n\nI feel that an antidepressant is fine IF the person is also taking either an anti-psychotic and or an anticonvulsant/mood stabilizer (I took lamictal with seroquel, or risperidone etc). However, no antidepressant fixes the root issues and by actually addressing root contributing factors I was able to get better results and get off the psych meds, and not keep accruing more side effect damage after meds left me disabled with a severely impaired endocrine system.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767678543.0, "id": "nxyln9k", "author": "PandoraAvatarDreams"}

Monthly Cyclical Episodes in Teen", "text": "Looking for information or lived experience related to bipolar and cyclical mood episodes that appear hormonally influenced.\n\nMy daughter is a 16.5 year old autistic female with a strong family history of bipolar disorder.

She is currently treated with Lamictal, Quetiapine, and Abilify, plus a high dose of Sertraline for OCD, which I understand would typically help PMDD as well.\n\nShe has not been formally diagnosed with bipolar due to her age, though she has been followed by the same child psychiatrist for over two years. Her psychiatrist is thoughtful and caring, but I wonder whether hormonal interactions may be outside his primary wheelhouse.\n\nShe has a hormonal IUD, which has lightened her period but she still bleeds about 14 days per cycle, quite reliably. The gynecologist does not want to try a combined pill due to mood concerns, or progesterone only due to bleeding concerns.\n\nWhile she is more stable than she was in the past, these monthly mood fluctuations continue, and it is difficult to watch her suffer.\n\nI am wondering:\n\nCan bipolar present with predictable hormonal exacerbation like this?\n\nIs it possible this is PMDD despite the timing?\n\nDoes anyone here experience something similar?\n\nWhat treatments or approaches have helped?\n\nI am grateful for any shared experience or insight.\n", "score": 5, "num_comments": 17, "created_utc": 1767575104.0, "id": "1q47hoy", "author": "FunChocolate1934", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q47hoy/pmdd_or_bipolar_with_hormonal_exacerbation/"}

Every psych med I ever took caused me harm, and not a single one of them actually address any of the now identified contributing factors to bipolar, but many make those contributing factors worse. For example, low vitamin D3 impairs serotonin production, disrupts circadian rhythm and further impairs T4 to T3 thyroid hormone conversion which is already impaired due to the mutation bipolar patients have to the D2 enzyme that impairs conversion of T4 to T3, leaving tissues starved of T3. But, seroquel causes central hypothyroidism in 50% of patients (brain damage) and it also causes hashimoto’s autoimmune hypothyroid (primary hypothyroidism) which I took for 8 years and got both, and risperidone causes a pituitary brain tumor that causes central hypothyroidism also and I took that for 6 years.

I'm not doing it for myself only, I'm not gonna be a dead weight to society. Not to save them from the hassle, but because I don't trust that if I need help, I will get good help or even any. I don't like people, I'm not doing for them, I don't particularly like my family, I'm doing because they already are a dead wheight for me, my sister is sweet but she is still young and I don't know for how long she will keep it sweet with this genetics, autistic diagnosis and a childhood that can lead to BPD. My mother portrays several untreated problems and I can't count on her for nothing but she always comes running for me as I am her mother. The level of parentification she threw on me and still trying to do made me want to get better for not being dependent on my family at all. I feel you about the check because I am still not able to do simple tasks like drive and I'm almost 30. I'm always posting on the mental illness subreddits about if you are not doing your work on dealing with this disease, you will f things up to a lot of people around you. I think people can read this as empathy when, thrust me, I have no automatic empathy for people, I just don't want to be dependent on people's good will because human beings aren't the ray of lights as much as I am not. You won't catch me dead right now actively planning to do something that would damage other people's lives, again, not Because I do care about those individuals, but because everything you do you pay with your inner peace when you're bipolar. All the feelings are paid, all the highs, all the lows, we always pay for them. I don't have enough currency/energy to be spending it on things that won't benefit me or even gonna but will make someone's life worst, because this consequence for other people will for sure haut me, and not though the traditional guilt, it comes in many ways. Today I'm in the middle of a polarity switch, from a mixed state to depression, I feel exhausted and I barely did anything. You can't make people comprehend this, so I stop demanding that people understand it. It's truly not their business to carry this weight, it is my job to rearrange my reality to fit this without getting on other people's ways because when it does, I am the one that gets the worst outcome, I am the one that thinks at least once a week about the time I screamed in high school with a very annoying girl because she was being a bully with me. I am the one that remembers that one time I got uncontrollably angry at a random event and almost caught a fight because of jealousy. People tend to forget if you do not commit extreme acts, but we can't just erase the feelings, can? We can take the meds to help it come in a normal way, we can do therapy to help us to understand and profusely catalogue what we are feeling, the origin, the function of the feelings, the motives of it resurging. We can try (I said TRY) to leave healthier. We can choose to not engage in risky behaviors without controlled surroundings and a strong supporting net. We can try to construct rules to make the risky behaviors less risky and also build those controlled situations. We can find in life people that want to be support for us (I said SUPPORT, not the one carrying all our pain and atonement). We can choose not to open certain doors that already lead other fellow bipolar and our obviously undiagnosed bipolar families straight to a real pain. No, there is no good life to us without this insane amount of work and I'm in that phase of treatment that I start to think if I hit the wall of the growth and proximity to a \"normal life\".

I'm not my mother's daughter because I can see my narcissistic traits and try to contain them as much as possible. I know the symptoms I have, I know that they aren't really me but they are part of me, so I try to contour it. Quite exhausting to micromanage it all but nobody else will or can do.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "People with bipolar have a genetic mutation that impairs conversion of storage thyroid hormone T4 to active thyroid hormone T3, leaving tissues, including the brain, starved of T3, even when they have normal thyroid function but blood tests may look normal and drs don’t normally know about of check for this mutation. Consider all the ways T3 is needed by the brain:\n\nThyroid hormone T3 affects nearly all brain areas, crucial for development (neurogenesis, myelination in cerebellum, cortex) and adult function, impacting mood (frontal/cingulate cortex)), cognition (prefrontal cortex)), executive function, and metabolism, coordinating neural activity with bodily energy use via gene regulation in neurons and glial cells across the hippocampus, insula, and motor areas)), influencing synaptic connections and glial health. \nKey Brain Regions &amp; Functions Affected by T3:\n* Cerebral Cortex (Frontal, Motor): Regulates decision-making, exploratory behavior, and coordination with metabolism.\n* Hippocampus: Influences learning, memory, and emotion; T3 deficiency linked to volume changes.\n* Cerebellum: Critical for motor control and coordination; T3 essential for proper development and Purkinje cell function.\n* Hypothalamus &amp; Pituitary: Regulates the HPT axisthrough negative feedback, controlling TSH and TRH release.\n* Prefrontal Cortex &amp; Insula: Involved in executive functions, attention, and emotional processing; altered in thyroid dysfunction. \nHow T3 Works in the Brain:\n1. Gene Regulation: T3 binds to nuclear receptors, altering gene expression for vital processes like cell growth, differentiation, and myelination (glial maturation).\n2. Synaptic Plasticity: Enhances neurotransmitter release (e.g., synapsin) and stabilizes synapses (PSD95), crucial for learning.\n3. Neuroprotection: Increases protective proteins (like BCL2) and reduces oxidative stress.\n4. Glial Function: Modulates glial cells (astrocytes, microglia) impacting neuron-glia communication. \nImpact of Thyroid Imbalance:\n* Hypothyroidism: Can lead to reduced gray matter, impaired attention, and slowed executive functions, affecting frontal and other cortical regions.\n* Hyperthyroidism: Also causes structural and functional changes, impacting mood and cognition. \n\nSo it’s no wonder our brains struggle with so many tasks and functions and so many symptoms result. \n\nFurther, many psych meds cause thyroid disease, both the hashimoto’s autoimmune hypothyroid and central hypothyroidism (when the pituitary or hypothalamus of the brain is damaged), for me it was seroquel and risperidone. The thyroid diseases took 20 years to diagnose and it’s been a battle trying to get adaquate treating for thyroid hormone replacement because the standard of care is so broken and thyroid advocacy orgs have helped me learn how to talk with my drs about this.\n\nSeroquel causes central hypothyroidism in 50% of patients and is covering the data up:\n\n https://psychiatryresource.com/articles/secret-potential-effects-seroquel-quetiapine-thyroid\n\nThis article from the NIH on the history and future treatment of hypothyroidism mentions people with bipolar have this mutation. \n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4980994/\n\nIn the future until a fix for the mutation is found, they may use T3 thyroid hormone replacement some day to help treat bipolar, but as of now one has to get diagnosed with a hypothyroidism to get help and it’s an uphill battle because most drs only want to replace T4 and don’t even know about the mutation which requires T4/T3 combination, or that central hypothyroid is being caused by the meds and it won’t be detected in the TSH thyroid screening test.", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1767591793.0, "id": "nxrr4gw", "author": "PandoraAvatarDreams"}

I (30F) have been on my three med upper-downer-all arounder regiment for nearly 10 years now. Wellbutrin, Seroquel, Lamotrigine. I have been overall very stable and functional for years which I am very grateful for. By far my biggest issue is appetite (thankfully it is not image or weight based).  For years I have had a hard time eating enough. Sometimes food is downright disgusting and I have to force myself to eat anything. Other days it's not as bad, but I'm STILL not eating enough calories in a day. I've developed some coping skills and have found foods that I find easy to eat. But it's gotten to a point where I am stressed out most of the day because I'm not eating enough and I feel so discouraged. At night when I take my Seroquel I finally, FINALLY get an appetite and then devour anything in reach before I pass out. In some ways this isn't a problem- if this caused me to gain weight that would actually be a blessing. But a whole day of barely eating anything still makes me feel like crap physically and emotionally. \n\nI finally realized that it's not worth it anymore. I know the Wellbutrin is at least part of my low appetite (anxiety and trauma likely also contribute?). So I am going to work with my doctor and go off of it, as I'm at the lowest extended release dose already. Two things I am curious about: \n\n* I am curious about people's experience going off of this medication.\n* I am also hoping to find other people who have experienced difficulty with appetite and not eating enough.\n\nThank you in advance, my bipolar buddies!!!! 🫶", "score": 7, "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1767485243.0, "id": "1q3akw9", "author": "Okay_then_now_what", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q3akw9/getting_off_of_buproprionwellbutrin_low_appetite/"}

I chose a reputable hospital that I was familiar with and also had other medical care because I wanted the best possible care. I went into the ED, told them why I was there, and brought me to the psych waiting pods where they took my belongings and made me change into paper scrubs. I waited about 10-11 hours but in between that, I was given food, and spoke with many doctors and residents, both medical and psychiatry. Since I was suicidal, I was in a pod with wide windows and I was assigned to a sitter when admitted to the floor of said hospital.\n\nOverall, my stay was great in my opinion. I was on a locked smaller unit with ten other patients (I was the eleventh; the unit holds 11 beds) and I got centered care. Met with the team every morning, food was decent, voluntary attendance to groups, open day room to watch TV, an exercise bike (to be used with an order from the doctor) and the staff overall were nice to talk to. Med adjustments happened gradually. Vitals taken twice: once in the morning and evening before bed/nighttime medication.\n\nOverall, I was safe and felt cared for. Lowkey, I miss the environment.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "Need advice - re: therapy", "text": "Hey guys sorry in advance if this is a bit long. I (31F) am bipolar 1, diagnosed ten years ago but mental health issues since 13, and have been very treatment compliant overall. I have worked hard to get to a point where I can truly say I do everything I can to manage my illness and take it seriously. I am super on top of my meds and meet with my psychiatrist on a very regular basis. For a while now, taking seroquel and lamotrigine has been really successful for me, though we tweak the doses of each as needed.\n\nComorbidities worth note are alcohol use disorder (sober &gt; 1.5 yrs), PTSD, and anxiety. However, these issues are also thankfully under control/manageable and have been for a while. All this to say I am in a really good and stable place mentally.\n\nMy problem is this. I have been in therapy for over 20 years now, and have been in a serious therapeutic plateau/burnout phase for a very, very long time. All in all I would venture to guess I have seen 10-12 different practitioners. I have heard over and over again from doctors, therapists, my parents, friends, romantic partners, and society as a whole that people like me require therapy in addition to meds and that it is a non-negotiable part my treatment and probably would be forever. I like to please people and feel and show that I'm doing everything in my power to be and stay well, so I am obedient.\n\nThere was once a time I spent every therapy session baring my soul and sobbing about my complex trauma, my family issues, my feelings of despair and dread and anxiety, my self-esteem issues, and a laundry list of other issues I identified as actively being barriers to my day-to-day life and well-being. I had one particular therapist for seven years during my twenties and while she was always a comforting presence in my life and safe person to vent to, I stalled as far as tangible progress, and she \"broke up with me\" when she learned I had been hiding the extent of my alcoholism (I can't blame her for that), referring me to someone new as I began my sobriety journey.\n\nI have now been with this current therapist (ETA - she is an LLC) for the duration of my sober time (&gt;1.5 yrs) and honestly I don't think I've had a single revelation, learned a single new coping skill, or gained new insight I did not arrive at on my own. I mostly discuss the facts of whether I have had any mania or depression, how my meds are going, what's happened since our last session (which is usually nothing lol), and mainly, the never-ending process of accepting my bipolar diagnosis and need for meds, and the feelings and stigma that come with that.\n\nIt's become extremely redundant, and most sessions end up being a more general chit-chat/social hour where we end up having philosophical or political types of discussions that are only tangentially relate to my \"issues.\"\n\nWhile she is very kind, engaging, and genuinely cool as a person, I don't really feel like she has much experience with bipolar, and I recently found out she rarely works with alcoholics because her dad was one and it's a sensitive topic for her...that was a bit of a shock to hear. Also, despite her taking handwritten notes throughout our whole session, she CONSTANTLY forgets even the most basic info about me like my partner's name, what meds I'm taking, major life events, or my sobriety time. She once thought I had been sober for five months when I was coming up on ten. (ETA - she's slightly older and I understand she's only human, but it's quite excessive). I would never feel comfortable calling her in the event of a crisis or even showing up to a session in one. I'd probably just call my psychiatrist for that.\n\nI'm at a loss. I could go over my traumas with a fine-tooth comb forever like I did for so long, but I truly feel that I have nothing left to say I haven't said 10000 times to multiple therapists, and opening old wounds doesn't feel productive any longer. I feel like there are literally no parts left of myself or my past that have gone unaddressed. Sometimes, I feel exhausted thinking and talking about myself, and feeling forced to only reminds me I'm ill and broken despite having worked so hard to see myself in a different light.\n\nAnyway I'm sorry this post turned into a novel but I just really need some advice:\n\nHow do you use therapy as a bipolar person, especially when you're stable? How do you determine if the therapist themself is the problem? Is it really a requirement for us, or is it possible to reach a point of closure? Are there any specific kinds of therapy (not EMDR) or practitioners that have proven beneficial to your bipolar treatment specifically? Have you found group therapy to be helpful, and if so, how do you go about finding one?\n\nIf you read this whole post, thank you so much.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1767466870.0, "id": "1q32xcu", "author": "xoxo_angelica", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/1q32xcu/need_advice_re_therapy/"}

Delta 8/Delta 9/THC-A are milder street legal alternatives depending on state. I wouldn't smoke any synthetic derivatives like THC-0/THC-X/HHC. Only from a reputable vape shop and not a tobacco store\n\nCannabis Induced Psychosis is a new concept emerging that long term/older smokers haven't grasped yet. People on the spectrum and/or personality disorders are more prone to it. Usually happens to beginner smokers, especially starting with concentrates/dabs, edibles, or flower mixed with other forms of THC like keef. Plus you can't diagnose bipolar if the psychosis was substance induced. \n\nBack in the day when you smoked shitty weed with the stems at like 20% THC, you get less of a high with all the cannabinoids still in the plant. Even with bipolar, it would usually manifest as paranoia or dissociation. You lose a lot of THC burning the weed. Edibles would produce a psychosis due to the different way it metabolizes, which is why I recommend avoiding edibles period. \n\nNow we have 95% THC isolate cartridges, gummies, dabs, 99% THC crystals, and other Delta cannabinoids mixed in. Without a massive tolerance, these will absolutely send you over the edge. These stoners are the ones who usually go into conspiracy theories, massive paranoia, or even an out of body/ego death experience. Even hybrid or indica strains aren't going to calm you down unless you add a significant amount of CBD in supplement\n\nI had latent bipolar symptoms, but starting with concentrates and not building my tolerance with flower completely sent me over the edge into psychosis. Cannabis Induced Psychosis made them rule out Bipolar at first, kinda fucking me for a few years. It wasn't until I went manic again that I got diagnosed 3 years later. \n\nDelta has started taking over the market as a milder alternative.

Wellbutrin belongs to the same group of cathinone derivatives. \n\nSynthetic cannabinoids tend to be far worse in their pharmacology.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "I wish I could sue the pants of astra-zeneca for covering up that seroquel (quentiapine) causes central hypothyroidism in 50% of patients, it took my drs 20 years to diagnose my hypothyroid (because central hypothyroid does not elevate TSH and central hypothyroid is considered rare so drs are not looking for it, based on the millions of people that have taken seroquel and 50% of them having central hypothyroidism and most of them don’t know it yet, central hypothyroid is not rare at all, it’s just rarely getting diagnosed. And there is  the horrible things risperidone did to me, a long story). Unfortunately it’s very hard to get a lawyer to take a case for psych med damages in the US. There is a loophole that basically makes it nearly impossible to sue if one only took the generic drug, and although a case opened up a potential pathway to sue if one took only the generic, I haven’t heard of any cases that so far, I hope that changes. Some meds have already had class action lawsuits for those who took the namebrand, such as seroquel for lying about other side effects they were not honest about, or for pushing offlabel use as a sleep med to people don’t have an approved diagnosis to use it, or risperdal had class action lawsuits for causing gynoclamastia in boys and men (it causes a brain tumor called a prolactinoma and that tumor makes males grow breasts, it did horrible things to me but I’m female and only took the generic so no luck for me there either. I have tried to get a lawyer but those that say they have experience suing for seroquel damage have already made their money from class actions and have a note on their site saying they are not taking any new seroquel cases, or, other lawyers I called were not interested, and now the statute of limitations has run out in my state. But they cannot shut me up from telling what happened to me to anyone who will listen. \n\nMCAS researchers in the UK have determined that post pandemic, 17%-20% of the worldwide human population have MCAS (also known as MCAD, the umbrella term for mast cell activation diseases) due to it takes something that stimulates the immune system to trigger onset for those with a genetic predispostion, and common triggers are a novel infection, a novel vaccine, or psych meds (because many act as antihistamines and or damage the gut, where the majority of the immune response happens). Seroquel also causes both hashimoto’s hypothyroid (primary hypothyroidism) as well as central hypothyroidism (damage to the pituitary/hypothalamus area of the brain) and thyroid function is connected to histamine, hashimoto’s antibodies bind to the mast cells of the immune system, activating them, for example. So, seroquel damaged the endocrine system causing hypothyroidism, and that makes mast cell activation worse. To add fuel to the fire, people with bipolar have a genetic mutation that makes the enzyme known as “D2” that converts thyroid hormone T4 to thyroid hormone T3 mis-shapen. This impairs the conversion to T3, leaving tissues starved of T3 even if the endocrine system is making plenty of T4 and the thyroid is otherwise ok. The blood serum for T3 may be normal, and not reflect the problem, and most drs do not know about this mutation, I had to show my dr the NUH article on the history of hypothyroid treatment which mentions how people with bipolar have this mutation. T3 is needed for many brain functions. Tissues starved of T3 explain why the depression end of bipolar is notoriously “treatment resistant” because psych meds not only are not addressing this mutations effect nor do they fix low vitamin D3, another critical factor, but they make things worse by damaging the pituitary/hypothalamus causing central hypothyroidism which doesn’t typically show up in the TSH blood test used to screen for thyroid diseases. \n\n Seroquel causes central hypothyroidism in 50% of patients and is covering the data up:\n\n https://psychiatryresource.com/articles/secret-potential-effects-seroquel-quetiapine-thyroid\n\nVery few people get diagnosed with MCAS because most immunologists, the current specialty that are suppose to be treating it, are not up to date of diagnosing and treatment protocols. A good place to learn more is a medical conference video where the dr that literally wrote the textbook on mast cell disease is presenting an “MCAS 101” lecture with slides, and I shared this with my drs. I finally found an MCAS specialist via a facebook group, after my other drs tried to refer me to other immunologists for 2 years who proved to be of no help. \n\nLink to YouTube Dr Lawrence Afrin, a hematologist/oncologist educating immunologists presenting at medical conference in Toronto in 2017: “MCAS 101”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lrKqlv6VK_w\n\nI met so many people in various facebook groups whose MCAS symptoms started with psych meds, and now I understand why, the medication’s effect on the immune system is not usually obvious until one tapers off. I had allergies and allergic asthma etc all my life and hereditary alphatrytasemia made all of those more severe and more dangerous, predisposing me to develop MCAS. \n\nI take a lot of meds including a biologic  to control MCAS and I changed my diet (alot of foods are high-histamine), my hives are alot less severe and I am not waking up going into anaphalaxsis like I use to. I still avoid stress like I am deathly allergic to it because I am. \n\nI got allergy shots for 20 years prior to my MCAS diagnosis and that helped alot too.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767599736.0, "id": "nxs6unh", "author": "PandoraAvatarDreams"}

Here is a video of neurologist Dr Stasha Gominak presenting at a medical conference about this, entitled “How to Fix Your Sleep” https://youtu.be/uj8FTWCb010\n\nHere are books that helped me learn the newer research that when applied gets better long term outcomes, and once I was better supporting my nervous system (fixed my low vitamin D3 and then maintained it with supplements and blood testing twice a year to ensure I am meeting my target level, corrected the omega6 to omega3 imbalance in my diet, worked with my counseling dr to conquer negative rumination and gain control of my thinking/mindset, exercise as regularly as I can manage, use a psychiatric service dog, prioritize sleep and self care, and much more) only then was I able to taper off my psych meds. I came off my wellbutrin first and a few years later was able to taper off my remaining psych meds in 2017, I was taking ativan and risperidone at that time. I have been psych med free ever since and not landed back in the psych ward but it was alot of effort. I completely changed my diet under the protocols of dual board certified in psychiatry and neurology Dr Brooke Goldner (her free support group is on facebook and she livestreams a weekly Q&amp;A asession across youtube instragram and facebook wednesday afternoons. I met her in person in 2016 and asked if her protocols could help me get off my meds, she said “maybe” well a year later I was psych med free. \n\nI hope you find what helps you, for tapering resources as most drs taper too fast, Taperclinic on youtube has videos about this and “The Ashton Manual” (google for free download) is about benzo tapering but is often applied to other psych meds and can be shared with their dr. \n\n\"The Depression Cure, The 6-Step Program to Beat Depression Without Drugs\" by Dr Stephen S.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "I am happy that my sharing my hard gained experience has been helpful. \n\nI know what celiac is, I was tested for it (was negative). I read a book (“The Wheat Belly Diet”) where the author suggested that the inflammation caused by grains in the diet contribute to the psychotic symptoms of bipolar, so I went grain free (not just wheat free but all modern grains which is hard to do as most processed foods have hidden grains and “gluten free” products often substitute with corn or rice products which as also grains). I was grain free for about 9 months until I broke my diet on thanksgiving, but I noticed it did make a difference. This was before I met Dr Goldner and learned why grains trigger this inflammation, they are high in omega6, which diverts the metabolic pathway to pro-inflammatory. She has a whole presentation explaining the science of how foods (animal products which contain arachidonic acid and other foods such as grains, nuts, and most seeds except flax or chia, have too much omega6) when those foods are eliminated the body better converts ALA (plant based omega3 from flax or chia seeds) to omega3 DHA and EPA, following a powerful antiinflammatory metabolic pathway which is key to reducing systemic inflammation which helps the body do alot of things, such as verse autoimmunity (she reverse her lupus nephritus 19 years ago), or get effective disorders under control (she gives the example of one of her patients with schizophrenia who got symptom relief if he stuck to her protocols but one bite of off plan food triggered his symptoms, and then there is me, psych med free for bipolar 1 since 2016 thanks to finding her protocols.) She is a psychiatrist but most people come to her nowadays for autoimmune disease stuff because she reversed her own advanced incurable autoimmune disease. Her protocols got my antibodies way down for hashimoto’s and I am hoping to prevent prograssion of RA (rheumatiod arthritus which my rheumatilologist found a stufy showing when hashimoto’s autoimmunity goes untreated eventually it can become RA given a few decades and he thinks that’s what happened to me because it took 20 years for my TSH to come back slightly elevated to diagnose hypothyroid.) I am not 100% whole food plant based vegan but I mostly am compliant with her protocols and the more I avoid off plan processed crap and animal products, the better off all my health issues. \n\nGut health is very much one of the root contributing factors that psych meds often make worse by their side effects, seroquel for example gave my severe constipation, to the point where my rectum would tear with each hard as a rock bowel movement. No matter how much water I was consuming I was always dehydrated which is not good for the gut, and our gut bacteria make most of our neurotransmitters so we need to take good care of them, that means feeding them an optimal diet to have a healthy gut microbiome.\n\nConsider the case of a women in Australia who had an experimental fecal transplant and that got her bipolar type 1 under control, she then changed her diet to keep her new gut bacteria happy. She said she was sick alot when she was younger and had to go on alot of antibiotics. I also was chronically ill as a child and was on alot of antibiotics which wipe out alot of gut bacteria. I now take probiotics to protect my gut microbiome from excessive die off due to antibiotics if I need to be on those. \n\n “How a risky DIY poo experiment transformed Jane's life, Australian Story”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Le5LKPNlOHQ?si=Sc3ZRc9pg3mpTjKk\n\nI basically accomplished the same, healed my gut, but I did it the hard way, by changing my diet under the protocols of Dr Brooke Goldner who dual board certified in psychiatry and neurology. I met her in person in 2016, and am in her support group on facebook, and she has a livestream answering questions every wednesday across youtube, facebook and instagram. \n\nMy gut was trashed she I met Dr Goldner but I completely turned that around with her “hyper-nourishing” nutrition protocol and then her other protocols focus on self care and prioritizing sleep and finding joy and comfort in things besides off plan food. \n\nIf you do have celiac and are eating grains that is definitely not helping your gut microbiome.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767786977.0, "id": "ny6odo0", "author": "PandoraAvatarDreams"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "Lost and Disconnected", "text": "I’m not really sure why I’m posting. I guess mostly because I don’t have anyone else to talk to about any of this. (besides a therapist)  I’m 59 years old and was diagnosed with BP 2 at age 56.  (Dr. vacillated between diagnosis of BP1/BP/2 for what it’s worth. ) I struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life.  I only had one episode of mania, but it was a doozy. After that 16 month episode, I went into a horrific depression and had residential treatment for three weeks. I feel like a shell of myself. I’m not depressed like I was, sitting on the couch all day doing nothing. But I have no interest in really doing anything. I have a part-time job (lost my full time job/career) that I have to drag myself to.  The worst part is my adult kids were very hurt by the things I did and said during my manic episode, and they have now pulled away. Truth is a lot of my behaviors for quite some time (10-15 years) have been difficult for them.  I’m not very confident.  I’m not consistent.  I divorced their father 16 years ago for reasons I now think were somewhat justified, and somewhat due to depression and my personality trait of blaming others for things that are really my fault.  I remarried to a good man who has kids from a previous marriage. His wife died and his kids only have him as a parent. As a result, I end up spending more time with those children than I do my own. They’re all adults now, so it’s not like they live here, but the fact is my kids don’t want to come and be with me at Christmas, birthdays, Mother’s Day, etc. They have their lives—one is married and has my first grandson—and they just prefer to spend time with their in-laws or with my ex-husband and his wife.  All those people are normal, and I’m just not.  I feel like my life is nothing.  My life really doesn’t have any meaning or purpose.  I have one good friend who stays in touch with me and we do things together. But most of the friends I’ve had have waned over the years . The depression and mania have had a significant effect on all my relationships. My current husband is a good man, but I don’t know what we were thinking getting married. He’s handsome and I was very attracted to him and we had many things in common. But there’s a lot of things we don’t have in common.  And his kids were not ready to have some other woman in their life.  I’m not sure they ever will be., but we definitely married too soon.  And some of our values just don’t match up very well.  His kids don’t like me. They tolerate me and tolerate my kids. So there’s no “blended family.”  My daughter has been in town for two weeks visiting with her dad and step-mom over the holidays, and I’ve only seen her for two days. I know I am not the best mom for my kids. I screw up dinners because I can’t seem to focus on doing the recipes right, and I’m just not that person who has it all together.  I really don’t have anything I can teach my kids or any wisdom to impart. I’m not really great at anything. I can’t teach them to cook, or show them how to decorate a home, or help them with organization, or finances. Their dad and stepmom on the other hand have a beautiful new home and they cook fabulous meals worthy of magazines (not exaggerating). They’re great entertainers. They have wonderful parties. They have a hot tub. And her kids like my kids. So they all have a great time together and have blended really well as a family.  My kids think of their house as their home when they come “home“ for holidays.  I’m glad my kids are happy. I just wish they could be happy with me.  When they come here, it’s often just me, and sometimes me and my husband. But he does things with his kids a lot, and I’m not included, not that I want to be at this point.  My kids like him and enjoy spending time with him, but they’re real close.  My life doesn’t feel like my own.  I am nowhere near where I thought I would be at this point in my life.  My house is disorganized, cluttered, and looks like I really don’t care.  I don’t have much going on in my life,  no friend groups that I do things with, no family traditions.  I’ve made so many decisions —getting divorced, getting remarried, buying the house we have, buying a second home up north— a lot of life altering decisions that I just didn’t think through. I think perhaps in addition to the bipolar disorder, I’ve also got some personality disorder issues and that I really don’t know who I am.  At nearly 60 years old, I’m not sure I’m going figure that out. I just basically go through the motions every day, trying to make myself look busy without actually getting anything done. I play a lot of games on my phone just so that I can focus on something other than how badly I feel about my life .  I try to figure out ways I can spend more time with my kids. There’s much more but I’ve already gone on and on enough.

I finally received the right diagnoses and they took me off of Paxil and started me on Lamictal, Lamictal helped with everything but major depressive episodes, so they added Latuda, Latuda gave me tardive dyskenisia, so they switched me to abilify which gave me akathisia. Finally, they took me off of abilify and they started me on Wellbutrin for my depression a little over two weeks ago, but I think it might be too activating/stimulating. I can't tell if it's causing increased anxiety or mania at this point.\n\nSo, my question is, has anybody diagnosed bp ever had any luck with taking an ssri.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "It’s sort of a minefield, depends sensitively on the individual. Some doctors just flat out say, “bipolar means no SSRIs.” That was my first doctor who diagnosed me. Others, they say, if we can get you stable enough and treated with mood stabilizers, it seriously lessens the risk of SSRI induced switching. This is my current doctor’s thinking. \n\nI agree with you that the SSRI really helps with anxiety (although I doubt it’s still doing anything for depression, honestly, that effect seemingly having worn off by now). That’s why I need to take it, because otherwise, I get really bad social anxiety. \n\nSo I’m sticking to the SSRI. The only thing is, if you do it this way, you’ll probably need to make increments and decrements in your dosage in response to any episodes. If you start feeling upwards, you’ll probably need to back down the SSRI. This has been quite annoying for me, going down then going back up to where I was, because those meds have a pretty nasty withdrawal syndrome… but its efficacy in anxiety outweighs its withdrawal, regardless. \n\nI also take Wellbutrin. Started it last year in a massive depressive episode. \n\nIt’s really weird how it interacts with anxiety. I could “nerd out” about norepinephrine and the different ways different brains respond to increasing it with Wellbutrin. Some people find immense anxiety release on Welly; others, it hurts their anxiety. \n\nBut I found that, yes the Welly was annoyingly activating in the beginning, yet that sort of smoothened out and it just became an effective antidepressant over time. It’s a very unique and potentially powerful antidepressant. But some people need to get through its initial activation, which can (but not always) decrease over time as you adapt to the drug.\n\nHopefully any of this is helpful!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767418090.0, "id": "nxe13he", "author": "DMayleeRevengeReveng"}

I've found it to be a healthy outlet, however I've also found that its not safe to play when im in an episode.  Being hypo, manic, or depressed,  its not safe to play because i lack healthy boundaries in those states.  I did a scene early on when deoressed, and lacked the abilty to say no, until a line uad been crossed, i eventually said red, and it stoped.   But it was borderline traumatic.   I have had very little interest in sex since the last time was terrifying.  I do still do bdsm, just asexual stuff involving pain.   \n\nBeing up holds the same risk,  of taking things to far, and also the altered state that comes from submission is not good to mix with mania.  Though i only did it once, i do think it was a factor in pushing a hypomanic episode into manic.   \n\nConsent is king in kink.  When deoressed, manic, or intoxicated ones boundires are blurred and proper consent is impossible. \n\nI play only when stable.   \n\nIf your interested,  take time to educate yourself. I can reccomend \"the new bottoming book\" or the podcast \"the kink perspective\", hosted by a kinkyr psychiatrist.   Safety and consent are a must. \n\nFeel free to message me or talk here.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "text": "If you have a manic episode you are Bipolar 1, you can change from BP 2 to BP 1 but not the other way. The label is really more for diagnostic purposes, it generally points to the mania being more critical to control in BP 1 which I think is accurate. \n\nThe thing that confuses people I think is that Bipolar 1 has a few different presentations, you can have people who only ever experience mania but no depression at all. You can have a classic Bipolar 1 presentation with a manic episode every few years with the depressive crash but generally stable otherwise. You can also have an atypical presentation which tends to be more of the rapid cycling or mixed mania thrown in. People with BP 1 can have every type of episode, I’m BP 1-rapid cycling with mixed features, I’ve had severe, moderate, and mild depressive episodes. I’ve also had euphoric hypomanic episodes and dysphoric manic episodes. I’ve been up and down the whole spectrum, although generally have only experienced full psychosis from med reactions (opioids mainly) after medical procedures. I was BP 2 for most of my life and then my disorder severely worsened and I spent several years in and out of the hospital with severe mixed manic episodes and several suicide attempts. For me personally, the BP 1 has been an entirely different beast than my BP 2 was. I used to be high functioning, went through grad school and my hypomanias were manageable.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "i was robbed.", "text": "I’m 16. i got diagnosed with bipolar type 1 psychotic features this year, among other things.  my first major depressive episode was when i was 10. at the time, it really was just endogenous. my life was good.  2 months later, my dad suddenly died.  my life permanently changed for the worse that day.  i was robbed. i had a good life. one with a bright, successfull future.\n\ni was only 10, i couldn’t process  a loss that big. that permanent. that significant. so i “moved on” pretty quick. i got into social media. i hung out with friends as much as i could. anything to  subconsciously  distract myself from the reality of the situation.\n\nby 11, i was regularly taking shots of straight liquor  in the morning. i drank all the time. people called it self medication. i didn’t see it that way. because it’s not like i thought about my dad and picked up the bottle .  i rarely thought about him. i told myself it’s because i somehow “moved on” or “accepted” it pretty quick. it was all a lie, i never even began to accept it. i was nowhere close to moving on.\n\nto me, i was just curing boredom. just having fun. just passing the time.\n\nmy mom didn’t care. she couldn’t.  she fell into major depression and also drank 24/7.  she knew i was drinking all the time. she only cared when i drank too much and there wasn’t enough left for her.\n\nby 13, i replaced alcohol with weed,  and  luckily this was actually a good decision and probably saved me from major health issues because i stopped drinking entirely after this. it was also at this time i began to have clear hypomanic episodes.  i didn’t know what it was at the time. it was just me feeling euphoric about the beauty of life. it was just me getting things done. bettering myself.\n\nby 14, i got fully sober. i was rapid cycling between hypomania and mixed/depressive episodes  at the beggining of my freshman year  and i stopped going completely.  things got really bad. my mom was now regularly doing meth (i didn’t know it at the time though).  the neglect got bad. the house was horrible.  4 months after i left school, she suffered a major stroke. i was horrified. was i really going to have no parents at all?\n\nsomehow, she survived and made an almost full recovery.  she then went in a psychotic state for months while continuing to do meth regularly. i was staying with family. no one talked to her. she hated us all.\n\nagain, i drowned everything out. first with video games. then by 16\n\nand then by 15 i had a clear and distinct mixed episode. still didn’t know what it was. it leaned toward euphoric though.  but it changed me entirely pretty quick. i relapsed on weed.  few months later i moved back in with my mom because i was  unknowingly in psychosis,  started drinking 24/7 again too.  few months later, i , moved back out and switched to weed only but i started doing it extremely heavily.\n\ni was in full blown psychosis now.  extremely paranoid. delusions. thinking the FBI was sending people with unmarked cars to surveil me. i had a panic attack every time there were knocks on the door. i spent hours looking out the window that faced the street  so i could atleast have a warning  if i saw them preparing to raid the house. i thought my family was gonna come in my room and kill me at night for literally zero reason.\n\nthen i began to rapid cycle and go through severe episodes. i was incredibly euphoric. i would just start crying from happiness at times. i was talking so much.\n\nby july of this year, after i turned 16,  i had a very classic manic episode. it was 8 days . little sleep. psychotic and paranoid features, extreme euphoria, extreme emotion.  delusions. near total detachment from reality.   then i fell into major depression. then just as suddenly, another manic episode appeared. but i could tell this one was an emergency and not something to just brush off again. i was incredibly euphoric. goosebumps everywhere. music sounded incredible. i was running around in busy streets for fun.   near total detachment from reality.\n\ni decided to go to the ER. i stayed for 84 hours. i got put on meds.  after i left, i fell into major depression. the most depressed i had ever been in my life. everything was flat, lifeless, grey, pointless. i began to seriously question if i was already dead. started drinking again after this.\n\n. i had been thinking about it nearly everyday during the episode, but just that. just thinking about it.  but day after day, it became a feeling. an overwhelming feeling that it was all over. that it was my time. it was almost bittersweet. just thinking about it brought me  relief.\n\nthen one day , i was trying to get drugs and it just wasn’t working out.  i decided it was time. i finally had the thought “alright, how should i do it”. i got out of bed. i started walking around thinking of any loose ends i wanted to tie up.\n\nand  i don’t remember why or what, but something distracted me, and i woke up the next day. only to go into another manic episode. pretty severe. i started doing opioids.  drinking all the time. then somehow i just fell back into euthymia slowly, and ive been there ever since. 4 months ago. but i encountered an issue. the in between. life was incredibly boring in euthymia, so i started doing more drugs. xanax,  meth, then cocaine, and now it’s becoming an issue. i can’t stop doing xanax. i can’t stop thinking about cocaine, i’ve done it like 6 times in the last 6 weeks.\n\ni can’t put the chemical reinforcements  down.  i  unknowingly sold my soul, my regulation, my happiness,  and my life  to them when i started drinking  all that time ago.\n\ni’ve been through and seen too much for my age, and it enrages me. i should have been able to have a father for my childhood. the worst part is, we were getting really close the months before he died.  i’m furious, i was ROBBED OF EVERYTHING. most people don’t even start developing bipolar until the age i am right now. and here i am already having it full blown.\n\ni’m able to live life now, kind of. i live for the small things now. i live for the fleeting moments of happiness, joy, contentment, no matter how infrequent. i live for the few people that truly get me.  the people that inspire me. and most importantly,  i live in hopes that one day i can have a good life.\n\nand unfortunately, i live for the chemicals that make me feel good. that tell me everything will be okay. that sing me a beautiful song.", "score": 2,

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "BipolarReddit", "title": "A Year Being Stable", "text": "Recently, I hit a milestone that I didn’t think was possible, because of how frequently I have depression. Very much like clockwork I’d have at least one major episode that lasts up to two months, and I’d become very disheartened about living with this stupid disorder. Somehow, on December 7th I celebrated a year without falling into depression. I keep a 5-year planner to monitor moods and medication intake, and the last time I took anti-depressants was December 8th, 2024. At this point I’m almost a year and one month being regulated. No hypomania and no depression.\n\nBy all accounts, 2025 was pretty brutal professionally and financially, so I expected that I’d just break down at some point. Pleasantly surprised it didn’t happen. I don’t really have a secret since I didn’t make headway into fixing my harmful habits. I never stopped taking lamotrigine, and I guess that the effects just stacked. I am writing this post mostly as a positive outcome for other people in this sub, because the majority of experiences have so little hope to them. It’s so unbearable having to live with bipolar in any capacity and I am in that camp. It’s exhausting. I am still having a hard time.\n\nHere are my takeaways, if anyone is curious.\n\nMoods: I get a much more varied spectrum of feelings and emotions. A few bad days do not automatically snowball into a downwards spiral, which is usually the case for me. I can just have a few bad days and then I can have good days and then just average days of just being a person. The result is that I am less afraid of having bad days and feeling shitty as they’re not a symptom of depression coming on. It’s weird. I am not used to it.\n\nEnergy: I can recharge faster after doing social activities as they do not overstimulate me as much as they previously have. So, there’s that. I have found that my capacity has increased by a nice margin. Not to say I’m a social butterfly and certainly pales in comparison to how social I used to be during hypomanic episodes. But still, it’s very nice. I’m trying not to push it too much in case I knock the balance off.\n\nFunctioning: This is where I have the most mixed bag.

Your safety needs to come first and if you are feeling like being the resource for everyone else is harming your own wellbeing, you are well within your rights to set some boundaries. Even something as simple as not answering the phone after a certain time of night, for example. But you'd need to have a very clear message in your head that you are not responsible for their actions, and don't have to be the person fixing all the problems.\n\nETA: to stop over sharing I literally have part of my brain monitoring conversations I'm in to go, don't say that. It takes mental energy - but that requirement is slowly decreasing as time goes on. \n\nAnd for the part with other people sharing their problems, maybe don't take it on as a problem you have to solve.

My dose was 300 mg for many years, but in 2020 I started getting EXPLOSIVE tachycardia every night, exactly 20-30 minutes after taking the dose. I had more than six ER visits overall, and consultations with specialists. And during the day my heart rhythm was all over the place. Even when it was slow, I just felt sick. I had to take heart medication for a couple of years. Seroquel at high doses can have nasty side effects for *some*, especially after prolonged use. \n\nI started seeing a new psychiatrist almost 3 years ago, because my main doctor retired from his practice, and my dosage was lowered to 100 mg initially, and I now take 50 mg every night. As my new psychiatrist explained to me, high doses of Seroquel are dopaminergic, which actually makes you feel more active. It’s counter-intuitive, I know. Lower dosages have a more pronounced sedative effect, like 50 mg/25 mg, but I found 50 mg to be my sweet spot. After all this changes, I’m in complete remission of my heart-related side effects. You can do some research on the effects that a high dosage can have on your heart. I know it’s difficult to lower it sometimes, because I believe high doses of Seroquel can also act as an anti-depressant and anti-psychotic. \n\nI hope I used the correct medical terms; I’m Colombian and all the medical jargon I know is in Spanish.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767296720.0, "id": "nx4njei", "author": "Own_Category_1122"}

All of it is coming through a very skewed lens. Regardless, it was said. You still have to take responsibility for it. Not implying you're not, but a lot of people hide behind the excuse of mania, or their guilt or necessary  processing of the episode can make their partner feel like their feelings are being minimized or invalidated. Hospitalization will have delayed and complicated this. If this was the first episode, they're processing this aspect of you, and that it can likely happen again. That's A LOT for everyone involved.

The Medicaid coverage I should be entitled to I can’t even use because after I got married the government refused to update anything even though I have gone to the county jobs &amp; family services office multiple times and submitted countless copies of my marriage certificate and stated on the proper forms repeatedly that my family income status has changed and that I no longer qualify for the Medicaid/Medicare combo plan that I qualified for previously. Luckily I have my husband’s private insurance that I can use, but because I can’t trust anything to be billed to Medicare properly I just don’t use it at all. I’m afraid that if things get audited they’ll realize their own fucking errors and say I need to repay everything they covered because I should have never qualified for that plan in the first place, even though *the government* is the one incapable of getting its shit together. It’s maddening. \n\nI’m currently pregnant and can’t even get a breast pump that is technically covered by both insurances, because my private insurance is required to know that I also have Medicare (even if it’s under the incorrect plan) they are aware and want Medicare to pay for it. But I just can’t use that plan at all because if it all backfires, I will not be able* to afford to pay back every single dollar they shelled out for any and all coverage because of how the healthcare industry bills Medicare in such an exorbitant and inflated way. So I’m not even getting one. There’s just no fucking way I can win. It’s way too risky. \n\nSo goddamn infuriating. Good thing I’ve decided to just go back to the same bipolar meds I was on pre-pregnancy instead of attempting to breastfeed so I have to use formula anyway. I plan on attempting to try to get it sorted out at the county office yet again, but that place is a crowded cesspool that I can’t risk stepping foot into while it’s still cold/flu season and I’m actively pregnant. I’m 30w now and due in March, so I won’t have an opportunity to go there without fearing for my wellbeing until after I give birth. \n\nThe only decent thing that disability did for me really was allowing for my $17k in student loans for a degree that I never finished to be forgiven. They’ll stay forgiven as long as I’m not working or enrolled in any higher education for however many  more years. I can’t quite remember. The monthly SSDI payment covers roughly 2/3 of our mortgage but I could never survive on that payment alone. Not in this economy. \n\nEventually I would like to get off of disability, go back to school to get an education, and hopefully end up working in a field that’ll be flexible enough to accommodate my mental health treatment schedule since I get bimonthly ketamine infusions when I’m not pregnant to keep things under control.

With my psychiatrist’s guidance, I went off medication in 2020, and I’m grateful for a supportive family and some good luck along the way.\n\nA recent breakup was a wake-up call, and I’ve been wondering if returning to medication might help me be more stable and show up better as a brother, son, friend, and colleague. I’m skeptical that naturopathic or nutritional approaches alone are enough for bipolar I, but I’m also concerned about medication side effects—especially long-term kidney issues.\n\nI’m seeing my therapist next week and will also be meeting a counselor and a private psychiatrist soon. I’d really appreciate any reassurance or perspectives from others who’ve thought through similar decisions.
