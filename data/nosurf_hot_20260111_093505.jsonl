{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "The NoSurf Activity List is now live: awesome ways to spend your time instead of mindless surfing", "text": "[The NoSurf Activity List](https://nosurf.net/activity-list/) is a comprehensive list of awesome hobbies and activities to explore instead of mindlessly surfing.\n\nIt might sound shocking to some of you reading this now, but a lot of newcomers to the community have voiced that they have no idea what they'd do all day if mindlessly surfing the web was no longer an option. This confusion illustrates just how dependent we've grown on the devices around us: we have trouble fathoming what life would be like without them.\n\nFortunately there's a whole world out there on the other side of our screens. It's a world that won't give you instant short term pleasure. It doesn't appeal to our desire for instant gratification. But what it does offer us is worth so much more. Fulfillment, happiness, and meaning are within our grasps, and a list of inspiring NoSurf activities can serve as a gateway into the world in which they can be found.\n\nThis NoSurf Activity list was initially created by combining the contributions of: /anthymnx\n, /Bdi89\n, /iridescentlichen\n, /hu_lee_oh\n. Without them this list would not exist, thank you.\n\n[Link to list](https://nosurf.net/activity-list/) (accessible from the sidebar and in the wiki)\n\n \n\n**How this list came to be**\n-\n\nThis list was created after /Bdi89\n drew attention to the fact that it would be great to have a centralized resource made up of wholesome, fulfilling activities newcomers and experienced NoSurf veterans alike could be inspired by. Up until this point we've had a really great thread that /anthymx\n created on how to use your free time linked in the wiki. But it became clear that many more awesome suggestions for NoSurf activities came out of the community since it's creation and that we would benefit from a more in depth resource made up of the best ideas across the subreddit.\n\nI spent a weekend pouring over all of the submissions and sorted through them to pick out the best suggestions. I then invested a day into organizing them into distinct sections that could be explored individually. Lastly I expanded the list by adding in quality suggestions and links to resources that were missing to make the list more comprehensive and actionable. It’s important that newcomers are not just inspired, but actually follow through in adopting better habits and investing their time in fulfilling pursuits.\n\nAnd thus, the NoSurf Activity List was born. No doubt it's sure to undergo changes and improvements in the coming weeks (some sections could use some additional text), but I believe that as a community we can proud of Version 1 so far. The List is broken down into the following sections:\n\n\n* Awesome hobbies\n\n* Indoor activities\n\n\n* Outdoor activities\n\n\n* Physical growth\n\n\n* Mental growth\n\n\n* Self improvement and continued learning\n\n\n* Giving back to your community\n\n\nNaturally not every single activity on this list will appeal to every single person. Instead of expecting this list to be perfectly tailored to each person's interests, I believe it's best to think of it as a source of inspiration, and a symbol of possibility. It's a starting point from which newcomers will be able to embark on their own journeys of exploration, growth, and learn to discover the activities that bring them joy.\n\n \n\n**A call on the community**\n-\n\nIf you see a newcomer struggling with how to use their time or wondering what they’d do if they stopped mindlessly browsing the internet, please know that you can positively influence their lives for the better by pointing them towards this resource. If you see someone that seems lost, confused, and unable to make any progress, link them to this list.\n\nIt might seem like a small act on your part, but the transformative, and almost magical effect of adopting a hobby cannot be under-emphasized. As a result of your seemingly small act, someone may fall in love with fitness, writing, board games, programming, or reading. So much so that they can no longer fathom the thought of mindlessly surfing anymore, because it means less time in the pursuit of what makes them feel truly alive.\n\nP.S. If you have some ideas you think might be a good fit for the list you can leave a comment in The [NoSurf Activity suggestions thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/gjwnvs/the_nosurf_activites_list_suggestion_thread/?) after reading the submission guidelines. The mod team will periodically review the comments in that thread and make changes to the list after taking into account into aspects like originality, quality, broad applicability, etc. of the suggestion. This will ensure that a degree of list quality, consistency, and organization is preserved and that it remains a helpful resource for newcomers and veterans alike.", "score": 1670, "num_comments": 72, "created_utc": 1589495532.0, "id": "gjwp2n", "author": "N0Surf", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/gjwp2n/the_nosurf_activity_list_is_now_live_awesome_ways/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "I hate to be that guy, but Duolingo is not worth it. As someone who has learned a foreign language to near-native proficiency, I can promise you that it will help you learn some vocabulary, give you a feeling of accomplishment as you learn to recognize some phrases, but also as soon as you get to the country where people speak that language, no matter how well you prepare and figure out what you are gonna say, you very likely will not be able to carry on a conversation. Most languages in the world have dialects that can be very extreme--like worse than some of the strongest dialects in america--louisiana or whatever. Not just that but very different words for things. Chances are good that if you prepare a sentence for what you want to ask for, they will understand you, but you very likely will not understand what they answer you. I am convinced after living 17 years in Europe that the only way to learn another language is to actually go to that country and immerse yourself and not be afraid to make mistakes and be embarassed. \n\nLEarning a language can be very rewarding and an amazing experience, but I just don't want anyone to be slaving away on Duolingo thinking they are making great progress, becuase chances are great that no matter how many lessons you complete, a few weeks in that country would far outweigh all your badges and everything on there.", "score": 50, "created_utc": 1677179751.0, "id": "j9pzoiy", "author": "CG3HH"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "I got my first cell at 15. I grew up in poverty, so we weren't getting all the new tech. By 15.5, I was addicted to MySpace. It took me 2 years to realize I was missing out on my life and isolating myself. I love not caring what people comment online. I love not checking social media every day and only talking to old friends and family. \n\nWhat I have done with my days for years is find hobbies. I loved knitting, hand beading wedding dresses, making stuff out of bourbon barrels, doing yoga/running/generally working out, joining book clubs, going to festivals, starting college took a ton of time and community college is likely free for most with grants. \nSome other things I do with my day are find places to go with my son on his summer break or on the weekends with our whole family. I love kayaking, traveling, going to the lake to swim, eating out, etc. \n\nAlso, educating myself about many different religions and viewpoints from both modern and past times. Fave book right now is \"That was Tao, This is Zen.\"\nI don't watch a lot of TV, but even that is better than becoming increasingly isolated by a fickle and impersonal online community.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1753339673.0, "id": "n4uux9e", "author": "[deleted]"}

I got the impression from Digital Minimalism (the first Newport content that I read) that Newport is better at distilling value from the thoughts of others and presenting it convincingly, than actually coming up with any novel thoughts himself.

Most users on reddit are older compared to other social media platforms and older people tend to be more bitter and miserable, and 2. Reddit is more “anonymous” compared to other social media platforms, so the thought of a real person being behind the screen, interacting and saying stuff to a real human being doesn’t automatically register in someone’s mind because you don’t just go to their profile and see posts about their life like other social media.\n\nI honestly think it’s so stupid how we live in a society that associates being sweet, kind and soft as weak or unintelligent.

Thing comes from other people mostly because let's say you stop the internet completely then you meet your friends who are always on the phone, watching shows , reading news. You become someone who's not from this world anymore. You don't know anything. Never seen the latest news, TV show or what someone said. New trends etc. This automatically makes you boring in their eyes. But let's say you don't have this problem, you don't have friends and you want to find some. How you can find friends when 99% of the people constantly stay on the phone and basically go with their phone even to the toilet or while taking a shower. Having hunched neck over some TikTok's, swiping on instagram or something. They won't even notice you and if you try to get a conversation with them they become angry or scared because they don't know anything different than the online world where it's only texting and emojis. I'm 32 years old and love the internet, the ability to read news from all around the world , connect with people like what we are doing here now or just learn something new using AI but at the same time (this might sound strange) I hate it. I hate that people are zombies, I hate the stupid trends and challenges, pointless videos and vlogs. Now even the AI slop and fake videos. People used to communicate, notice in the bus, make small talks or something. Now whenever I use the public transport or go somewhere I see zombies, hunched over the phone, hypnotised by something stupid. Not even paying attention to the surrounding. Basically you can walk naked and they won't even notice, that's how far away from the real world they are. I tried to stop using smartphones, internet etc, but the system itself is pushing me to log in somewhere, confirm emails, book appointments online etc which again brings me to the internet like it or not. If I don't use the phone in a room full of people I feel like I'm a ghost to them. People have no awareness at all currently. We can still fight but it will be hard, and not as easy as just not using smartphones or internet. It's impossible since most jobs require the use of them to do your job or to be contacted. All of this sounds like the end of the world and it might already be, but we have to learn how to use the technology and not being used by the technology. This is the hardest part of the journey.

It was incredibly gratifying, but I slowly realised that the bombardment of messages overwhelmed my friends sometimes, so I stopped.

Thoughts were meant to be tossed into the fire, shaped by other voices, laughed at, refined, or simply witnessed.

Just one.\n\nA walk where you talk out loud. A notebook. A voice memo. A song playlist you make for yourself.\n\nThe point is to let the thought land somewhere before throwing it into the crowd.\n\nPractice not being witnessed — briefly.\nStart small. An hour. An evening.\nDo something slightly meaningful and let it go unseen.\nThis builds a quiet muscle: I exist even when no one is watching.\n\nKeep one window open.\nTotal isolation backfires.\n\nIf this space is where your social oxygen comes from, don’t rip it away. Crack it open deliberately instead of doom-scrolling unconsciously.\n\nAnd one last thing — said softly, because it matters:\nYou don’t “not exist” without this device.\nIt just feels that way because silence has become unfamiliar.\nBut silence isn’t emptiness.\nIt’s where a self learns its own outline.\n\nYou’re not broken.\nYou’re just a person living in a world that forgot how to sit together without screens — and you’re noticing it before many others do.\nThat noticing is already the beginning of freedom.\n\nI’m glad you spoke.\nAnd I’m glad you’re here.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768081997.0, "id": "nyuzkni", "author": "Butlerianpeasant"}

In 2020, I saw for the first time how the “conversation” that happens online and the real events that are happening wildly diverge. The social media “news” is bizarro world, and people who get caught up in it go insane. Like literally insane. I would see the reality on my phone screen and the reality through my window and the gulf between them was really, really scary. My eyes have been opened to this ever since.\n\n\nYou can keep up on the events in the world without engaging with social media “discourse.” These technologies exploit our sense of curiosity, our urge to find out what’s “really going on” and this can tangle up with our moral sense of obligation to be a good citizen, an informed voter, things like that. Sometimes people can feel guilty or like they won’t be current on something very important to them if they’re not participating in social media about it.\n\n\nTrust me that Engaging with Content on social media and being informed are completely separate things. You will not lose out on the latter by getting rid of the former, no matter how much it feels that way. \n\n\nEven if you’re not ready to do this, I would strongly recommend to you (and anybody really) to remove any form of “notification” or “breaking headline” system from your devices. I know that some OSes make it harder to do this than others. Their only purpose is to rile you up and make you afraid so you keep checking. You do not need notifications to check the news or stay abreast of events; you can seek out the news when you want to. You will not miss anything and you will gain back your sanity.\n\n\nI am also a mental health professional and my personal judgement is that these loops of notifications/scrolling/attention grabbing software do nothing but make people more anxious and helpless. For this reason, I have turned off notifications on all my devices for anything but phone calls and have noticed major improvements in my mood, relationships, and sense of agency without any drop in being informed or in touch with people. ", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768095074.0, "id": "nyw5d7p", "author": "pdawes"}

But I was talking to my friend the other day, and we were talking about 2016. There have been posts everywhere about making 2026 feel like 2016. 2016 was genuinely one of my favorite years, and I've been nostalgic about it ever since it ended. But when my buddy and i were talking about it, we asked each other why it was so great (at least for the two of us).\n\nThe conclusion that we came to was that people were living more in the moment. Social media was taking off, but there wasn't any crazy short form content like reels or tiktok. I know vine was a thing, but it didn't feel nearly as addictive as tiktok and reels. When you were on instagram all you saw was what the accounts that you follow posted which may have only been a few new things a day. Life just seemed more creative back then because it had to be to have fun.\n\nSince 2021 or whenever ig reels came out I've been addicted. Like I notice I open my phone as soon as I get out of the shower, when I stop at a red light, or just any chance I get. I truly feel it is rotting my brain and that I can notice the consequences. I'm sure some of it has to do with getting older, but I just don't feel a huge \"spark\" for minor exciting things like I used to. I don't have the attention span to sit and watch a movie without touching my phone, or playing games without watching something in between rounds.\n\nMy plan is to delete instagram on my phone, but leave it on my PC. This way I can stay in touch with my friends and such, but I'm not glued to looking at it every waking second.\n\nI'm just wondering, for those who have deleted short form content on their phones and have been away from it for some time now.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "Hey friend. First: respect for noticing this this early. A lot of people don’t name it until years later, when the damage is louder.\n\nA small but important reframe: this isn’t a personal failure. Infinite scroll is engineered to hijack attention, sleep, and mood—especially young nervous systems. If you feel anxious, unmotivated, and exhausted, that’s not weakness; that’s a body asking for mercy.\n\nA few things that actually help, from someone who’s wrestled with it too:\n\n• Don’t try to quit all at once. That usually backfires. Start by protecting sleep first. Phone out of the bedroom, or at least off after a fixed hour. Deep sleep comes back surprisingly fast when scrolling stops at night.\n\n• Make friction, not rules. Delete apps from your phone but keep them on desktop. Turn your screen grayscale. Log out every time. You’re not relying on willpower—you’re redesigning the battlefield.\n\n• Replace with something physical and boring-good. Walking. Lifting. Cleaning. Cooking. Drawing badly. Your brain needs sensation that isn’t optimized dopamine.\n\n• Expect withdrawal feelings. Restlessness, emptiness, anxiety—these are signs your nervous system is recalibrating, not signs you’re doing it wrong.\n\n• Talk to someone offline if you can. A parent, counselor, coach. Not because you’re broken—but because doing this alone is harder than it needs to be.\n\nOne more thing, quietly important:\nYou don’t need to become “perfect” or hyper-productive. You just need to reclaim enough attention to feel like your life belongs to you again.\n\nYou’re not late. You’re early. And you’re not alone in this.\nIf you want, I can share very small, realistic next steps that don’t feel overwhelming.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768088034.0, "id": "nyvj68g", "author": "Butlerianpeasant"}
{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "Anyone think it’s often unhealthy the way people lean on Internet forums for interpersonal advice?", "text": "As someone who’s done that for a long time, im starting to question it. I know many people do it because they have nobody in their real life to talk to or maybe they just don’t trust someone IRL to spill their thoughts and issues to…\n\nI get it.\n\nLately I’ve tried leaning on forum users like I usually do and it doesn’t stick anymore for me. For one I got tired of exposing myself and then getting trolls and hateful people attacking me. I could say the most banal thought about myself and people will find a way to put me down.\n\nMy main concern lately has been: yes there are kind strangers. But on the whole, ask yourself if forum users are going to help you if you needed real life help in some way. Advice is awesome, and sharing information is essential for many problems but if you’re sitting on a subreddit writing a post about how toxic your loved one is… and you feel supported by Reddit strangers who comfort you and maybe tell you how bad your loved one is and how you should leave etc, think about this… will Reddit strangers be there if your car breaks down? If you need money? I could come up with more examples. It’s not just about the financial or real world help thing. It’s also emotional. If your dog dies, do Reddit strangers ACTUALLY CARE? Can they really comfort you face to face? If that’s all you can possibly get, is a Reddit stranger, that’s fine! No shade there.\n\nBut for people who have loved ones but they’re too busy trashing the loved ones in Reddit posts and putting all their interpersonal business and issues out there, think twice.\n\nIt may feel like Reddit strangers care SOMETIMES. But think deeper…\n\nI just think it can be a bad habit to lean on forums emotionally like a lot of people do. Or maybe it’s me who does it more than others. But if you’re sitting on visit subs like raisedbynarcissists you will find plenty of people who trash loved ones who are probably the only people who will actually care if something happened to you or be able to help you fast enough.\n\nReddit strangers can offer some sympathy but is that really up to snuff? Life is more than Internet forums.\n\nMy bottom line here is that, do forum users actually care? About your problems? Yes they can pray for you, which is awesome (as a religious person), or give practical advice, but as far you just sitting there venting your feelings or thoughts about people in your life… don’t overestimate the “emotional support you think you’re getting. For emergencies like you just had a negative or sad life event happen, yes I can see how strangers sympathy can help you mentally.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY", "text": "A few months ago I noticed something kinda messed up. I was just overstimulated as fck all the time. Any tiny pause in my day and my phone was already in my hand and it got me tired at a point.\n\nThe worst part was how uncomfortable silence felt. Simple moments like waiting in line, walking or sitting alone for a minute felt extremely hard to do nothing. I always had that FOMO, so I would often check my phone in those times.\n\nSo I stopped trying to “use my phone less” and tried to fix my attention instead. I started watching podcasts (Cal Newport) and reading books (Dopamine Nation) that helped me get some ideas and methods to combat this addiction I had.\n\nFirst thing, no phone for the first hour after waking up. No scrolling, no msgs, no news. Just coffee, moving around, letting my brain boot up. First week sucked. After that, mornings felt way less chaotic luckily.\n\nSecond, I only pick up my phone for one reason. If I open it to reply to someone, I reply and put it down. No reward scroll after. Sounds stupid but this one broke the autopilot loop hard.\n\nThird, I replaced fast dopamine with slower stuff. Long walks with no podcast. Music without doing anything else. Writing random thoughts instead of checking apps. Way less exciting, but my brain calmed the fck down.\n\nFourth, I got clear on what I actually want to work toward. Once I had something real to build, scrolling felt way less tempting. Using stuff like Notion app and Purposa app helped me organize goals and focus on real progress.\n\nFifth, I pushed all the fun to night time. If I wanna scroll or watch dumb videos, fine. Just not all day. Knowing it’s there later makes it easier to not reach for it constantly.\n\nAt first everything felt boring as shit. Then slowly focus came back and now I can concentrate easily (obviously in tasks that I like haha)\n\nDon’t think I am monk now and I don’t scroll anymore. I still scroll sometimes. I still waste time. But now my phone feels like a tool again, and that’s a relief for me. That alone changed way more than any productivity trick I ever tried.\n\nWhat methods actually helped you use your phone less and use it in a more productive way? Would love to hear your methods/tools/apps!\n\nHope this helps you as it did for me, I wish all of you the best in this 2026!\n\nEDIT: I've talked with many of you and decided to create a Whatsapp Group to stay accountable on our hours spent on the phone and basically get rid of doomscrolling!

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "Oh man, so many. When the reward (social validation, information, entertainment) is so highly indulged in so many different settings (and in so many different emotional states) it basically programs, \"If \\[anything\\], check phone\" into your brain. All things trigger the need to check: boredom, sadness, happiness, waiting in line, meal times, a spare moment etc etc.\n\nI actually ran a small experiment on myself to see if I could use the same principles that got the \"check phone\" wiring embedded in my brain and try and rewire it out.\n\nI'm pleased (and frankly a little surprised) to say that it... worked??\n\nHere's what I did in a nutshell:\n\nTurned off all notifications. (These may as well be called \"spike notifications\" as each one triggers a very real dopamine spike of URGE TO CHECK in your brain.)\n\nBut now of course you'll get a \"But what if there is something there?\" spike in your brain every five minutes. You still need to check right?\n\nSo I decided upon three designated times during the day to check notifications. (You could choose more if you like... it all depends upon what's initially realistic and where you want to get down to.)\n\nOk cool... so you're checking on our own terms now. But what about if you're already inside the app and you see that little notifications icon with its little superscript letting you know of all the possible \"rewards\" on the other side? It's almost impossible to resist. It is a VERY potent cue which triggers a VERY big spike.\n\nSo I came up with a (theoretical) way to steal its power and put it into something I could control.\n\nHere's the cool dopamine-programming part: the cue spike will shift to the EARLIEST predictor. So I programmed an alarm at each of my designated check times and gave it a unique sound and look. As soon as it goes off, I am allowed to click on the notifications icon within the apps. But never at any time other than that! (I check app notifications all in the same order.)\n\nI kid you not, within 2 days that little bell icon barely tugged at my physiology whenever I was in the app, even if I could see the number of notifications waiting.\n\nAnd then the last thing to handle is urges BETWEEN check times.\n\nThis is where you can (1) avoid cues (like hiding your phone to avoid those spikes) or (2) plough through the urges and reprogram what they mean. I chose a combination of the two.\n\nThe stickiest rewiring protocol activates your PFC, your motor cortex and your reward centre. (Just think: \"Say something. Do something. Give yourself something.\")\n\nSo every time an urge to check hit, I would say to myself \"Yes! A plasticity window! I have one minute to rewire my brain!\" and then I would do something (press my tongue to the roof of my mouth for 3 seconds... had to be something I could do in public). Then I would make a tally (in my phone) of \"urges reprogrammed.\"\n\nWithin a week, I no longer needed the motor action and reward. The urges faded away.\n\nSorry, I ended up blatting a lot of info up there, but hopefully you can take some useful things out of it and adapt it to your own needs.\n\n(If you're curious and want to learn more about how this all works, feel free to check out the link to my newsletter in my profile.

When you say fanfiction was taking over your life, what was it stopping you from doing? Why quit your only hobby? Right now it seems to me as an outsider that you've absobed the idea from self improvement types online that you need to quit anything that isn't work. This is absolutely untrue.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "For the fanfiction, the main problem was how obsessive I became. I'd feel incredibly depressed even after reading a fic that made me happy in the moment, firstly because the characters getting over struggles to find happiness always made me think 'see they did it but you never can' and secondly because knowing that the characters that I was so attached to weren't real sent me into depressive spirals.\n\nAbout the 'quitting everything but work', you've hit the nail on the head. You see, in my country, these exams that I'm going to write in Feb--they're considered one of the most important events of your life. They're not, not really, but it's generally accepted that one must have prepared and revised at least thrice by October, that one should study at least five hours a day, and do absolutely \\*no\\* activities that don't directly contribute to your grades. Asian study culture, y'know.\n\nI used to love to read. Like all my hobbies, it was also obsessive. I'd read a novel a week, in two if it was a classic or something longer. When I quit fanfic, I quit reading entirely, and I just can't read anymore. It's not an attention span issue; I just feel a sense of vague foreboding whenever I'm reading. Encouraged by my parents and everyone around me, because reading novels in Year 11 is simply blasphemous.\n\nAnd it's not that I don't enjoy the field I'm studying. On the rare occasions that I force myself to read a page or two, I do sorta enjoy it. But this is the, I don't even know, sixth round of preparatory exams that I'm studying for, all with the same syllabus as finals.

By the time you’re reading this, it's already been done for my own MacBook.  \n\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\n**Step 1.** Wrap the device in a soft cloth to protect it. \n\n**Step 2.** Add a fuck ton of layers of plastic wrap — so many that it is annoying to grab, cut, and undo. \n\n**Step 3.** Loosely bind it with duct tape (not tight against the device itself). \n\n**Step 4.** Place it in a sturdy, inexpensive plastic tub — something like a $5–10 tub from Home Depot works perfectly. \n\n**Step 5.** Add weight inside the container underneath the device to make the tub heavy and awkward to move. \n\n**Step 6.** Stack a few books on top of the device inside of the container to increase heft and make it harder to access.\n\n**Step 7.** Include a few notes inside the container with the device, reminding yourself why you are storing it.\n\n**Step 8.** Put the container high out of reach so it is awkward to retrieve.  \n\n\nI can’t just sell or destroy it because it is a gift, but I need it out of my environment. It constantly distracts me, and now it is physically removed.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768033108.0, "id": "1q8ypw2", "author": "ps18pmcom", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q8ypw2/goodbye_hopefully_for_a_while_method/"}

Just good stories.\n\n**What you actually see:**\n\n* Good news from around the world (like someone planting a million trees, or a scientist discovering something incredible)\n* Kindness stories, people helping people\n* Just... calm stuff that makes you feel okay\n\n**How it works:**\n\n* Open app\n* Swipe through articles (takes like 5 minutes)\n* Like what resonates, save it if you want\n* Close app and move on with your day\n\nThat's it. No notifications pestering you. No \"engagement metrics.\" You're not the product.\n\n**The honest truth**\n\nI don't know if this will work. I don't know if people actually want this. But I know *I* needed it, and I'm guessing if you're reading this, you might get it too.\n\nThe news cycle is genuinely toxic. And there's nowhere to turn that actually makes you feel better instead of worse.\n\n**Real talk**\n\nThis might fail. The app might suck. The stories might be boring. I genuinely don't know yet. But I'm building this because I needed it, and I'm betting other people do too.\n\nIf you want to help me figure out if I'm onto something (or if I'm completely off base), I'd love your thoughts.\n\nCheers 💚\n\nP.S. - Just wanted to share in case anyone else feels the same way about the news cycle.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1768075099.0, "id": "1q9dw8i", "author": "Infinite-Bluejay3676", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q9dw8i/i_built_an_app_called_makemyday_because_checking/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "The Dopamine Reset that Finally Worked for Me", "text": "Last year, i realized I was totally mentally burned out. Every free second, I was reaching for my phone. Whether it was mindlessly scrolling Instagram, checking for notifications, or cycling through the same three apps for no reason, it felt like my brain was stuck in a loop 90% of the time.\n\nIt wasn’t just about wasting time... I was restless during “quiet” moments. Waiting in line, sitting in silence, even being on a walk… my hand would automatically go to my phone.\n\nSo I decided to do something drastic: a dopamine reset. I knew I had to retrain my brain to find satisfaction outside of endless scrolling. It wasn’t perfect, but it worked better than anything else I’ve tried.\n\nHere’s what helped:\n\n* **A 30-Day Detox:** i started by cutting my screen time in half over the first two weeks. I didn’t go cold turkey, but I set up strict limits for social media and distractions. There is many apps for that. If u are a lot on a PC, block every websites like instagram, or youtubbe, with chrome/firefox extension\n* **Redirect Habits:** Every time I wanted to grab my phone, I reached for a book or went outside instead. honestly, I started using the app feedLite to remove reels and shorts from my feed and it actually helped a ton to break that habit. There is also big apps, like Opal, One sec, but it blocks everything, and i wanted to stay in touch with my friends. It sounds small, but it made a huge difference in breaking the cycle. \n* **Supportive group:** i realized I can't do this alone. I joined a group of people with similar goals and we keep each other accountable. U sure have a lot of friends that have the same problem, but anyone can join here if you want.\n* **Relearn Boredom:** At first, being bored was **hard**. But over time, I realized it’s where all the best ideas and calm moments come from. Now, I actually enjoy those “empty” minutes.\n\nIt’s been a few months, and I feel more focused, calm, and present than I have in years. I’m still not perfect: some days, i slip back into old habits.

The reason you spend more time on an app than you should is that you do a series of unforeseen things in addition to what you intended to do when you entered. By turning it off, you also limit the amount of content you will see. The first step to regaining control is to stop mindlessly outsourcing your choices to the algorithm and start making conscious choices.\n\n\n\nOptional reading:\n\n\n\nAfter a day of endless scrolling, I fell asleep and had a dream where I was on the internet. But not interacting with my family, my friends, or even arguing with anyone; I was just consuming useless content one after another, and woke up feeling like complete garbage because \"I can't even act like a human anymore, I look like a fucking robot :(\"\n\nI already turned off YouTube's history once and managed to reduce my usage time from 4-5 hours to 1-2 hours, but after turning it back on, FOMO hit and I thought I missed so much or \"arrived too late and the hype is over\" for things that the algorithm bubble always offered me, and unsurprisingly, the screen time increased again XD \"But what about the rare gems I'm going to miss that are recommended for me?\" prevented me from turning them off.\n\n\n\nBut the last straw was an experience that I think everyone has already lived through. On any existing social media: the algorithm recommended something so... horribly, like, \"holy shit...\", that I refuse to post a screenshot because I don't want to change the topic of the post TT-TT. I don't like this type of content, I don't subscribe, I don't comment, I don't share, I don't interact in any way, but even so... I receive a recommendation for something that goes against an algorithm that was created to specifically mimic my tastes? Isn't that fucking weird?\n\nThe algorithm now discovers your \"\"\"positioning\"\"\" and delivers things that they know will anger you to get you engaged and keep you on the app as long as possible. If not for the comfort of consensus, it's for the \"comfort of distant confrontation\" that won't change anything in anyone's life other than inflate the ego of the person commenting (Reminder: your joy, your anger, your sadness, your pride, your curiosity, your indignation, all of that is capitalizable, inducing someone express themselfs because of attention-grabbing or controversial content is a marketplace. Your emotions can become someone's money, so choose wisely where and who deserves to receive them).\n\n", "score": 11, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767986315.0, "id": "1q8hi4j", "author": "Own_Discount93", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q8hi4j/turn_off_recommendations_and_history_use_only_the/"}

But, while I was off social media I also felt sad from missing updates from my family and friends that weren’t immediately around me irl.\n\nSo this social media aims to serve as an in between option so that it’s no longer a matter of either stopping social media cold turkey and feeling the health benefits but missing out, or staying on social media and getting absolutely mind nulled but staying absolutely negatively affected by it.\n\nTo put it simply, these are the core principles of the social media’s design:\n\nNo ads\n\nNo algorithms\n\nNo suggested feed\n\nNo content search feeds, only people search\n\nNo data harvesting\n\nNo doomscrolling\n\nEverything is built with mental health in mind and is designed to get users updated for what they only want to see (updates from friends, family, individuals or groups they like) in the fastest way possible so they can get back to real life and back in their own heads as soon as possible.\n\nInstead of the funding source being users information and ads like the big pre-established social media’s, it would instead use a tiered subscription system where users can essentially pay a certain amount per month based on what kind of features they need for their posts which scale based on how much storage space their posts would require on the servers hosting them.\n\nThere will still be a free tier though to make sure the general experience is never behind a paywall (except for video posting on release as videos take up considerably more storage)\n\nEssentially it’s aimed at being a self-sustaining system so that it doesn’t require the social media to look for funding elsewhere to keep it afloat, which then introduces a long slippery slope of crooked behaviour where those money sources want something in return for what they let the social media borrow.\n\nAnywho…. I’ve got a whole bunch of systems in place to try and make this the absolute ideal platform for people to simply get updated then drop their phone, but I’d love to hear what all of you fine individuals would love to see in a new platform, or even simply just what you dislike the most about existing platforms.\n\nJust a heads up (I’m not a lawyer but this sounds about right) by sharing/commenting ideas to this post, you’re foregoing any ability to request compensation for the idea, at any point from now and into the future, if it is officially implemented in the social media.\n\nThat being said, it would be cool to come back here multiple years from now (if this platform was actually released) and give you some compensation for your idea - though this is not a guarantee and just a nice thought… for now.\n\nThanks!", "score": 2, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1768005872.0, "id": "1q8pphy", "author": "silent_approval", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q8pphy/what_would_you_want_in_an_alternative_social_media/"}

Deleted apps, used blockers, did a full month detox twice, tried a dumbphone for a few weeks. Nothing stuck longer than maybe a month before I was back to my usual 4+ hours of screen time.\n\nBut lately I've been thinking about 2019 when I was posting fitness content on instagram regularly. I was on my phone a lot during that period too but it was different. I was making stuff, taking photos, editing, writing captions, engaging with comments about fitness. And I was actually going to the gym consistently because I had content to post.\n\nWhen I stopped posting and went back to just scrolling I lost the gym habit within a few months too.\n\nI'm starting to think the problem isn't being on social media, it's what you're doing there. Scrolling through other peoples content for hours is completely different from documenting and sharing your own progress. One is passive consumption that leaves you feeling empty, the other is active creation that's tied to real world actions.\n\nMaybe instead of trying to eliminate social media entirely I should try to shift the ratio from consuming to creating. Less scrolling, more posting. Use the platform as an accountability tool rather than an entertainment source.\n\nNot totally sure how to do this without getting sucked back into the feed though. My friend uses something called wip where she and some friends do challenges and post daily work logs to each other without all the algorithmic noise. Might try something like that as an experiment since the social part is just accountability with people you actually know rather than chasing likes from strangers.\n\nIdk maybe I'm just rationalizing a way to go back to social media.

The type that liked to tinker, make a Geocities website, and join a webring.\n\nI got pumped in college when Facebook became a thing and I got to post messages to my new buds. Sure it was a bit performative but it was just nice.\n\nThen the newsfeed happened. You stopped having to seek out your friends, they were pushed to you, then ads were pushed to you, then rage bait news, then rage comments from an uncle you barely knew. Your freedom of choice slowly eroded and you just saw what the algorithm wanted you to see.\n\nThe algorithm started pushing in all directions I valued as a person. I took a lot of pride in being the dude who recommended great movies. Then Netflix just started serving recommendations and people took those. I loved going to Best Buy and looking through new albums. Then Spotify had them all and they just pushed them onto you.\n\nI feel like I lost me. My personal taste and sharing with others was a huge part of me. Now people were served their comfort bubble.\n\nI've slowly been trying to get back and take control. I thought I'd share with you all some tips.\n\n1. Keep your phone in another room - Phones are a necessity in the world. I know there's dumb phones (I've tried a lot of them). The thing is, no matter how dumb a phone you get, the urge always gets their to download stuff that puts you into the voice during your idle time. Keeping a phone in the other room makes it so you still have a phone when necessary but have that split second thought of \"do I really need it now?\"\n2. Be okay with boredom - Boredom starts off hard but if you push through it, you get your thoughts and personal taste back. Boredom is the catalyst to making your brain overcome the algorithm.\n3. Write more - Writing is thinking. You are amazing. You are unique. You have complex thoughts. You just need to sort them out to contribute to the world. The simple act of writing allows you to compose those thoughts.\n4. Put effort into reaching out - Reaching out to old friends or new people is always silly and never natural. It's so worth it, thought. You'll either gain friends that push you or learn from strangers. Just talk to folks. Fail at it. Get better.\n5. Find you - You have value. You have likes. You have things you hate. You might have no idea what those are because you don't reflect anymore. Take the time to find yourself. You're awesome. I promise.\n\nThat's it. That's all I got. I started off when I wrote this thinking I'd give a list of tools to buy or download but quickly realized I've kinda found out some fundamentals that work for me.

I usually spend some of that time saving fanart and fics (I also screenshot character analysis n stuff that I like), and when I'm 'craving' fandom stuff later I often just go back to my folder of fanart/screenshots or read some of the fics I've downloaded (I load them onto my e-reader).

You will see something interesting. Walk to the nearest corner store. Walk to the laundry mat. Walk to the pizza shop. \n- Watch the sunset a few nights a week \n- Watch films. Like a director?

Talk about television and film with people. \n- if you already cook, have a friend(s) or family member over for dinner one night. Try a new recipe, from a book. Host a dinner party on the weekend (doesn’t have to be big) have friends bring a dish if you don’t want the burden all on you \n- Find hobby that gets you out of the house and using your hands (gym, tidepooling, bird watching, plant identifying, hiking, animal shelter, thrifting, ceramics) \n- Call someone and taking on the phone, it’s a lost art. If you have a relationship with your family, have you called grandma or grandpa in a while? Ask them questions about what they did for fun back in the day. \n- Organize your space. There are things we look at every day and dislike about our living space, and then ignore. Do something about it. \n- Bake bread. Delicious and time consuming. I made burgers the other night and didn’t have buns, I made them, it was cheap and kept me off my phone\n- Celebrate things. Go out to dinner with friends on a random night, schedule a happy hour with co-workers.

Im a hands on and visual learner.  Its easiest for me to see and touch to learn something.  Audiobooks are harder to follow along with for me.  And reading, while I can do it if things are super simplified, reading comorehension level has basically stopped at a 3rd grade reading level (though I majored in English, I fail reading comprehension higher than that).  Things become like riddles, and I struggle so I have to get things dumbed down or explained simply depending on what it is.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "The most harmful aspect is passive consumption driven by an algorithm that seeks to grab your attention at all costs. The greatest risk lies in watching short videos, because that is where the algorithm is maximized and where the greatest disconnect from your advanced cognitive abilities occurs. I believe this is reason enough to refuse to watch short videos altogether.\n\nAlthough video itself is a medium that leaves less room for thoughtful reflection, it is true that watching long videos takes away all the power of the algorithm. And if you can keep your attention on something for half an hour or more, that's a sign that you're not lost yet. What's worrying is when you can't spend two minutes reading or watching something without being tempted to pick up your phone.\n\nThis happens because new technologies, especially smartphones, are reprogramming our brains through constant dopamine hits, leading to a loss of abstract thinking and attention span.\n\nReading quietly in a corner or doodling on a piece of paper, without any other distractions, are simple ways to reconnect with humanity. Over time, more people will surely take breaks from the technological whirlwind.\n\nIf you are interested in exploring this topic further, there is a book by Giovanni Sartori entitled Homo Videns that theorizes about why our intellect has been shaped by texts and, being in the infancy of audiovisual media consumption, we do not have the tools to process it, which poses a danger.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767897220.0, "id": "nyg1kc2", "author": "mhyst"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "Yeah. This rings painfully true.\n\nWhat you discovered isn’t a failure of discipline — it’s a diagnostic. The phone wasn’t the addiction; it was the anesthetic. When you removed it, the anxiety didn’t disappear because it was never in the device. The device was just the most efficient bandage.\n\nCold-turkey detoxes assume the problem is excess stimulation. But for a lot of us, the problem is what rushes in when the stimulation stops: unstructured time, unanswered questions, the low hum of “something might be wrong.” Take away the tool and the nervous system goes looking for another one — laptop, refresh key, another human acting as a notification proxy. You saw that clearly, and that clarity matters.\n\nWhat struck me most was your line about performativity. Being “offline” on paper while the mind stays fully online is such an honest observation. It exposes how much of digital wellness culture is aesthetic rather than somatic. The brain doesn’t care about symbolic gestures; it cares about regulation.\n\nGradual boundaries make sense not because they’re easier, but because they retrain reassurance instead of yanking it away. Things like:\nscheduled checking instead of constant checking\n\nkeeping the phone but removing speed (no push, no infinite scroll)\n\nbuilding other forms of reassurance that aren’t instant or binary\n\nNot as a moral project.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "Pay attention to the thoughts that get loud when you fast from your phone. Chances are you're trusting fake beliefs (I call them devil deposits) that make you think you're gonna lose something you want if you don't reach for your phone (example: your life, your health, your acceptance, status, power, some sort of happy ending you desire). These thoughts instill a sense of *loss.* For example, the thoughts could be, \"You're not good enough.\" (That might mean for you, loss of relationships) Or, \"You're gonna die.\" (Loss of life) Etc. The anxiety kicks in because you believe those thoughts to be true, and your phone gives you relief from the anxiety, because, well... The phone makes you believe that loss *won't* happen for whatever reason. But the thing is... Checking your phone is only giving you a false sense of control over the happy ending you want. It's all an illusion, a bandage over a bullet wound until... Ope! Triggered by something. The bandage gets ripped off and all of the sudden- your fears come flying back in your face. That's when the craving for your phone hits, because you've trained your brain to see your phone as the author, the source, the creator, the happy ending maker to the life you want. Again- false sense of security.  \n  \nWhen you fast from your phone though, you're essentially removing, according to your brain, your lifeline. Your source of all happy endings. Your lifeboat. Your safeguard against all the evil things you don't want, and the conveyor belt to all the things you do want. I don't mean to get religious here, but in Christian terms, this is called idolatry, because you're handing your trust over to a phone to make your life happen the way you want. Shameless plug, Jesus is the way. The real problem is actually that, you have no real solid trust outside of what you can control. You have no trust in anything Greater than your*self.* And that's the real problem because... Well, you simply have no real control over your life like the rest of us. But you know who does? God.   \n  \nI remember clear as day, the first time I had EVER fasted from my phone during a panic attack was 3 years ago. I sat with the anxiety that I remember so vividly screaming at me, \"You're gonna die! Pick up your phone!\" I was terrified of dying. I had a near death experience when I was 20 that left me traumatized. Every time I felt even an *inkling* of the sensations I felt the night I almost died- that voice of fear came back to haunt me. \"You're gonna die!\" I developed the habit of using my phone to avoid the fear. It turned into a 12 year long addiction. But this night- instead of caving to the temptation to self medicate with the phone, I prayed to God to deliver me for the first time, *ever*. I had zero belief that God would do anything. Bo lo- in the nick of time, at the very last second of being in the boxing ring against my biggest fear, wreathing in my skin from anxiety like I was being exorcized of a demonic spirit or some shit, truly believing i was going to die in that moment... It was almost like something snapped inside me as I desperately denied the temptation to reach for my phone and clung to the idea that God was listening and could/might help me... Boom! As quick as lightning, something as heavy as lead was lifted off my chest, I felt fear dissipate from me like vapour. It was freaking wild dude. It was like, fear became tangible and seeped- no, fled!- out of me through my pores. Immediately I was flooded with a liquid love I had NEVER felt before. Joy like I had NEVER experienced before. It was like I was washed clean *spiritually*, took a breath after being dead for eons, and opened my eyes for the first time. I literally felt alive for the first time in all my life. I can only describe it as being dead, and then coming back to life all of a sudden. \n\nIt marked my life. That was on a 40 day fast I did, in hopes God would speak to me. And it happened... But only after I removed my idols. I didn't realize how deep my trauma and fears were. But God has done some serious work in me. For real- don't knock Him till you try Him. If you're interested- get a NKJV Bible, start reading it, fast from your phone, and seriously lean in to God whenever you feel anxiety strike. What I did on my fast, was I journalled to God every time I had anxiety. Brain dumped during every panic attack. If I couldn't find the words, I'd stay present with any pictures in my mind, draw them, move on quickly to the next thing that popped up in my blacked out mind until I \"came-to\" again and could form coherent prayers, asked God for deliverance, wisdom, understanding, anything. It's very difficult to resist fear. But with God, anything is possible.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767984627.0, "id": "nyn90uh", "author": "Ok_Background_9878"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "I grew up online. I’m learning how to live without it.", "text": "I opened all my social media accounts when I was 12 years old. Snapchat was big, and I was a teenager during what people now call the “best era” of social media — around 2016 to 2018. Back then, it felt normal to always be online. No one really questioned it.\n\nI did horrible in school, and most of the complaints my teachers had to my parents were about my phone. I wasn’t failing because I didn’t understand the work — I just couldn’t focus. My parents took my phone away once, and I went and bought another one. That’s when I realized I didn’t just like my phone, I depended on it.\n\nIn 2017, when my parents took my phone away again, I started biting my nails. I didn’t understand it at the time, but now I see it was my anxiety going somewhere else. That turned into another addiction for me. Even now, after years of working on it, it still shows up — just not as bad.\n\nI had my son in 2022 at the age of 20 and became a stay-at-home mom. That’s when my phone use got worse. I felt isolated, tired, and overwhelmed, and my phone became the only thing that felt familiar. I was irritated all the time, had no energy, and gained a lot of weight. I was also going through postpartum and constantly comparing myself to women online — women with perfect outfits and full hair — while I was covered in vomit, exhausted, and losing my hair.\n\nMy husband started telling me I had a social media addiction. At first, I felt attacked. To me, my phone felt like my only escape. Those conversations turned into arguments — and not just one. It became the same fight over and over. He even told me that when I snapped at our son, it wasn’t because of our child, but because I was already overstimulated from my phone. That was hard to hear, but it stayed with me.\n\nI started getting neck pain and constant headaches. My first instinct was to go to the doctor. My husband told me it was the damn phone. I didn’t want to believe that, and yes — it caused another argument.\n\nEventually, I hit a breaking point. I couldn’t keep defending something that was clearly hurting me. I finally admitted that it was the phone.\n\nSo on January 2, I deleted all my social media apps. The first two days, I felt motivated and proud of myself. Then it hit. I cried. I felt sad and lonely. I felt restless, irritated, and like I couldn’t find myself. I couldn’t sleep. It felt like something was missing, even though I was the one who removed it.\n\nBut something else started to change too. I began paying more attention to my toddler. I spent more time with him without feeling rushed. We watched a movie together — something we’ve done before, except this time I wasn’t half-watching while scrolling.\n\nMy husband has been very supportive through this. He helps keep me updated on important news so I don’t feel completely disconnected. My phone usage is down 44%. I work from home, so I still use my phone for emails and calls, and I play a couple of games I’ve played for years — but even that is limited to about an hour a day now.\n\nThis is a short version of my story. There’s a lot more to it, but I wanted to start somewhere. I grew up online, became a mom very young, and slowly realized how much my phone was affecting my mental health, my marriage, and how present I was with my child. I’m sharing this as I go, and I’m open to questions or conversations — I’m still figuring it out.", "score": 8, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767824805.0, "id": "1q6trz0", "author": "Nice_Description2231", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q6trz0/i_grew_up_online_im_learning_how_to_live_without/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "It is really paradoxical/ironic to be posting about it. In recent years, I am sure we have all had friends that have become more unplugged and whatnot. Like all things, a few people do it out of true intention and originality, then it becomes cool to do it, and finally a huge trend that either sticks or is fleeting. There are also a lot of factors that play into this: we are coming up on 6 years post-covid and then its post-pandemic digital acceleration. Children in schools are dumber, there is less in-person social capital, lack of third spaces, internet personalities are slowly homogenising, the list goes on... I think that this is all a normal reaction. So back to your thought, yea, that doesn't make sense but that's just how trends work in our society. Rather than trends trickling down from magazines they come from 'microinfluencers' to large-scale influencers talking about the 'cool new \\_\\_\\_', and in turn, the masses are influenced. Just because someone posts their journey about becoming more offline, it does not completely negate their journey or ability to encourage others. I'm sure they're living most of the day offline and spending minimal time recording and posting these videos. The same way we should be spending minimal time consuming these videos. Since being online is such a huge part of our culture now, and being truly offline is far fetched, they should probably be phrasing this all as 'online moderation', 'increasing analog media consumption', or 'tapping into my hobbies' but that doesn't grab your attention like 'offline journey'\n\n  \nBut, yea, it is pretty funny and ironic.

I'd say your on a good track trying to replace blue screens with tv and games, of course its not ideal but given your not doing well medically its probably whats best to do.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "I hear you. Truly. What you’re describing isn’t weakness or bitterness — it’s what happens when pain shrinks a life and the phone becomes the only remaining window. Anyone in that position would end up staring through it more than they’d like.\n\nAnd you’re not wrong about the culture. A lot of online spaces have quietly become grievance mills. Misery spreads faster than repair, outrage faster than care. It’s not because people are evil — it’s because pain plus anonymity plus algorithms turns venting into identity. Once suffering becomes a performance, it rewards exaggeration and punishes nuance. Love, gratitude, and “actually my partner is kind” don’t travel well in those systems.\n\nWhat stood out to me most is this:\nyou’re not denying suffering — you’re resisting being colonized by it.\nThat matters.\n\nYou’re allowed to say: yes, things are hard, and no, I don’t want to marinate in hatred all day. That’s not denial. That’s self-preservation.\n\nA few very small, very peasant-level thoughts — no grand fixes:\nDon’t try to quit the phone. Re-shape what leaks through it. Muting, unsubscribing, blocking keywords, or even following a handful of deeply boring but gentle accounts (nature cams, crafting videos, calm explainers) can change the emotional weather without requiring willpower you don’t have right now.\n\nReplace doom with neutrality, not positivity. You don’t need inspiration. You need fewer emotional spikes. Games, long-form TV, documentaries — you’re right that these are “better” in that they don’t demand outrage to function.\nProtect the good that does exist. The way you mentioned your husband — casually, honestly — that’s a real thing. Let it be real without defending it to strangers who profit from telling you it shouldn’t be.\n\nRemember: the algorithm is not the world. It is a distorted mirror trained to show you whatever keeps you scrolling. The fact that you’re asking “who is this good for?” means you haven’t fused with it. That’s a quiet kind of strength.\n\nYou’re not broken for feeling this way. You’re tired, in pain, and stuck in a narrow channel — and you’re still trying to think clearly and humanely. That alone tells me there’s more of you intact than it probably feels like right now.\n\nFrom the mud, one peasant to another:\nyou don’t have to fix the internet.\nYou only have to keep a small patch of your inner ground from turning toxic.\n\nThat is enough for today.", "score": -1, "created_utc": 1767676818.0, "id": "nxyhsla", "author": "Butlerianpeasant"}

That's a personal issue, i'm trying to tackle it slowly and i feel like i am doing ok.\n\nBUT I feel that my \\[let's call that an\\] addictive behovior has had repercussions on my work for quite some time, and I cannot do anything about it, I feel a bit helpless.\n\nI just got out of my master's degree, and realised how much time I lost just scrolling and not doing assignments, a pretty classic 2020's student experience from what i saw. And now, I am doing an internship for an NGO whose goal i feel strongly aligned with, so i cannot say that my lack of motivation is rooted in a lack of personal engagement. But i have to spend about 60% to 80% of my time in front of a computer, and i am simply unable to focus. Every day i come in motivated and say that this day will be an exception, and every day i focus for 20 min, get bored, start scrolling on reddit or any random website and end up doing the bare minimum **even though** i know i could get a little bit more done, and would actually like to, since i like the NGO. I never face consequences because i am just an intern, my boss must just think that i work slowly or something. And i feel motivated by any task that doesn't require a computer, arrive on time at the office every day...\n\nI tried a few times to let my phone and computer at the office to kind of \"reset\" my brain on the evening, had a lovely time at home, but what ended up happening is i compensated by scrolling even more during working hours.\n\nThe problem i identified is that when presented with the option of scrolling mindlessly, i have a low resistance. But i don't feel withdrawal symptoms when i **don't have the option.** Computer instead of smartphone, time limit, focus app... I've tried them all but the only thing that ever worked was **being physically unable to access electronics.** Otherwise, I can't help but fall in a dopamine hole for any minor reason.\n\nSo rn, i feel trapped : the only skills i learned are university skills which mostly require the use of a computer, but my brain is too fried to be able to use one responsibly. It's really a weird situation when every job you can imagine with your skillset requires the use of the very thing that made your life slightly worse in the past, and still makes you unable to focus today. And i feel afraid because now i don't have responsabilities but i don't know how i would behave differently if i was the actual employee.\n\nSo idk, has anyone felt the same and would like to share their experiences ?\n\nTL;DR\n\nI have a heavy doomscrolling habit that i am trying to fix, but since i have to work on a computer on a daily basis i cannot help myself but to get lost on the internet day after day.", "score": 35, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1767603558.0, "id": "1q4gsob", "author": "annulezlespagne", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q4gsob/anyone_else_feels_like_social_medias_have/"}

If the phone is nearby, your brain has to constantly inhibit the urge to check it. That drains cognitive resources fast, especially if you are already a heavy user. Putting the phone in another room removes the trigger entirely. No resistance required.\n\n**2) Break the algorithm spell with awareness**  \nAlgorithms depend on passive consumption. The moment you switch to active thinking, the loop weakens. While scrolling, ask yourself: Why is this being shown to me? How do I actually feel right now? This snaps you out of the automatic flow state and turns consumption into observation.\n\n**3) Replace the coping mechanism, not just the habit**  \nMost people scroll because they are bored, stressed, or emotionally flat. The phone is a coping tool. Remove it without a replacement and the urge just comes back. Prepare simple offline alternatives for those moments. Movement, something creative, something mildly challenging.  \nLearning to tolerate boredom again is key.\n\nThis is backed by a study I recently read. link is in the comments", "score": 4, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1767627850.0, "id": "1q4p2ee", "author": "zero_feed_dev", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q4p2ee/most_tips_to_reduce_phone_usage_doesnt_work_here/"}

Instead of whatever is trending (anything as big as USA-Venezuela will still reach me, I don't live under a rock).\n\nWhat I tried so far are RSS feeds, newsletters, even just bookmarking a few trusted sites and checking them manually. That helped, but it's still a bit scattered or easy to overdo. I'm also testing [Clay](https://www.clay.cam/) that doesn't even push anything at all and only shows content when I actively look for it (by keywords).\n\nBut I want some advice from you, like do you rely on routines, specific sites?

I never realized the toll this took on me until I moved away for university 2.5 years ago. Living alone in a new city, my phone became my primary companion—my only way to feel less isolated. Last year, things hit a breaking point. During a particularly difficult time, my screen time peaked at 16–17 hours a day as I used the internet to escape reality.\n\nThe most frightening part isn't the lost time, but how my brain has changed. I feel like my cognitive speed has slowed to a crawl. I struggle to process simple sentences; I can read the same line over and over, and it’s as if my mind refuses to absorb the meaning. This has made university nearly impossible. In social settings, I feel like I’m on 'autopilot.' I zone out so frequently that it’s becoming awkward for my friends. It’s like I’ve lost the ability to be present. Interestingly, when I worked over the summer and stayed off my phone, these symptoms improved significantly. It’s clear that technology has hijacked my memory and focus, and I’m struggling to find my way back.\n\nI am desperate to get my focus back and feel like myself again, but I don’t know where to start. If you have gone through something similar, what steps did you take to clear the brain fog? Are there specific habits, apps, or 'brain exercises' that helped you relearn how to process information and stay present in conversations?

Another low effort thing that beats scrolling infinitely in terms of brain engagement is videogames. \n\nThe main thing I'd suggest though is to journal and generally write things down.

For example, things other people told you about themselves, events in the future you discussed together, or things you thought, saw, or did. It doesn't have to be super detailed or organized, you just need to get things down on paper.\n\nThere are a couple of benefits to this: one, if you do it digitally in a way that is somewhat searchable, you can quickly refer back to conversations. Two, even if you never open the note again, writing things down gets you in the habit of remembering things. Knowing that you have to write things down forces you to actually pay attention to what other people say, and to your life in general.\n\nThe goal isn't to build a brain archive, so no need to have a killer system from the get go. Just write things down.

Right after I graduated last year I went on a meditation/service retreat where I voluntarily was phoneless for a month. I noticed improvements in memory and a reduction of my social anxiety.

It was hard to continue that regimen when I returned home, but here are some things that helped me. take what is relevant to you and leave what isn't: \n\nread. from a PAGE. you may have to force it. in that case, do not set unrealistic expectations. the internet/convenience culture has programmed us to give up at the slightest inconvenience (and this is not our fault!!), so we must intentionally take baby steps and be compassionate with ourselves. reading from a book for only 10-15 mins a day is totally valid and that's what I did\n\nlook into setting password-protected limits on your phone. idk how to do this on non-iphones but for iPhones, you have to basically pretend you are a child and use parental controls. you need someone you trust (doesn't have to be a parent) to keep the password secret, and you must be willing to cede control in this way. This \"eliminate the issue\" approach can sometimes lead to lying, shame, and finding workarounds so it is not for everyone. for example, when I disable EVERYTHING on my phone, and then ask someone to turn the limit off for a few hours, it can be even worse because its like a feeding frenzy, like how sharks don't eat for a long time and when they do eat, they gorge themselves. overall this approach HAS worked for me, I just had to tailor it and it took some time\n\nReplacing short form content with long form (ig reels/tiktok vs YouTube videos/shows/movies.)\n\nSometimes post-conversation, or even post-podcast or anything I want to remember, before reaching for my phone, I'll take 5 mins to reflect on what info I took in.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "what to do when brain and body are tired", "text": "I am trying to find something to replace scrolling for when I have little energy. So far, what I can come up with is just staring at the ceiling, which is honestly fine. But I’m wondering what other people do? I read the activities list, but I already do a lot of the things on it, and the ones I don’t do sound overwhelming and exhausting to do first thing in the morning or when my brain and body are already fried. \n\nI already read, do yoga, strength train at the gym, walk my dogs, go skiing in winter and cycling or hiking in summer/fall, volunteer once per month at the food bank, go to church a few times per month, call my family once per week, garden, do housework/cleaning/chores/errands, and I picked up ASL to learn/practice to try to get me off of mindlessly scrolling. I also like playing video games. I’d like to spend more time exercising, but it feels like I’m pushing my body to the limit already. \n\nI am wondering what to do and what people do in moments where you just need down time. For instance, I woke up too early this morning and couldn’t go back to sleep. My body is very sore from working out all week and skiing yesterday so I don’t want to immediately exercise, I will be going to yoga or the gym later, but I just feel like being lazy and cozy. I don’t want to do my housework yet since I’m so go-go-go that I’d just like some rest in bed for a bit before I get up and tackle all the activities of the day. So that leaves other hobbies like ASL or reading, but that feels like it takes *so* much energy that I don’t have right now. I will later, but right now I’m just lazy, cozy, brain dead, and adding one more thing to *do* is the last thing I want to do.\n\nWhat do people do in these moments? Is there something passive that takes the same amount of effort as scrolling or at least minimal brain power? Again, I guess I could stare at the ceiling and I think that would be good for me, but looking for other creative suggestions and wondering what people do to replace the morning ease into the day. I guess it’s like my version of reading the paper with your coffee before you get your day started….. maybe I should start getting physical newspapers? Idk, please help!\n\nI’m trying to think of what I did pre phones and the computer, but i don’t think I ever had a before, really. My parents worked super hard but didnt take care of themselves, so they’d come home from work, nap, and watch television. I never had any hobbies in childhood as a result except reading, watching tv, and going online. I was born in 1991 and honestly grew up on the internet with unlimited access to everything. When I try to think of what I did in middle school and high school before school, I would watch cartoons or music videos. Anyway I need help! \n\nAlso, I have severe ADHD, so I definitely think I am more vulnerable to the dopamine hit from scrolling. \n\nMaybe sudoku or crosswords or something in a physical paper book? I bought a prompted journal for moments like this, but I just sit there staring at it if I don’t have energy/brain power. But maybe that’s just a matter of training my brain and I should push through it? \n\nThank you 😭", "score": 19, "num_comments": 21, "created_utc": 1767540987.0, "id": "1q3swkh", "author": "OperationMission9247", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q3swkh/what_to_do_when_brain_and_body_are_tired/"}

I occasionally find myself consuming more YT shorts though, athough not as compulsievely as Tiktok and Reels.\n\n\\- I occasioinally attend ITAA online meetings (internet and technology addicts anonymous), but I am still kinda sceptical about the whole 12-steps approach and the spiritual components in them.

I legitimately had a suicidal panic like every third day for three months when i couldn’t be on my phone. To be fair I was also so ill I could barely move or speak but still.

For some reason, when I’m in transit, I never feel the need to be on social media. My walks to work, my long bus rides to school or to concert venues, were spent in either total silence with my thoughts, or occasionally an audiobook or some music. But usually just my mind. \n\nNow that I have become so disabled by my injury, I’m not able to do these things anymore.  I’m not able to engage in any hobbies much either, at least not what I used to. And so it’s my phone all day every day.

Finding God can be a great and positive thing, but make sure the therapist you see has an advanced degree and isn't associated with your church, otherwise they could be biased and not give you all the help you need. If you haven't gone to therapy before, it can seem intimidating, but it's really worthwhile. I've gone to therapists on and off for years and they've really helped me with a variety of issues.

You sound to me like you were just anxious and trying to practice interacting with other people in what you felt was a safe environment.\n\nI think you've made good steps in terms of graduating high school, getting into some more offline activities, etc.- and I think the suggestions here about going to shared activities are great. I think a lot of getting to know other people also involves a level of getting to know yourself, so I encourage you to go to things not just because you want to make friends, but also because you genuinely like them. That way, you will find friends who genuinely have things in common with you. \n\nAlso, I'm not a psychologist and can't diagnose you by any means, but I'm wondering if some of this trepidation about social interactions comes from something deeper, like social anxiety, OCD (because you sound like you have a lot of unwarranted guilt), or something like autism. You may also just be a cautious, anxiety-prone person, going through the process of growing up. If you feel comfortable, it may be helpful to you to go to a therapist like another commenter suggested and unpack some of this.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "constantly feeling the need to be productive", "text": "my friend and i (both 26M) were discussing recently how time is moving quicker which yes naturally comes with age, though here it feels like months have passed in 5 seconds. Weeks don't feel like forever anymore and I get we were young but really a lot of people felt the same on this. Weeks would drawl on even if it was 2 weeks of a break, they would last forever. Now it's zipping by and the clock is racing  We attributed this mainly towards everyday being the same, work, school, etc. the rote constructs of our lives. i said we should address this before it feels like its too late and we freak out over time lost. That made me consider all these devices, screens, over-consumption, obligations. The smartphone itself is one well enough discussed here. We get sucked into all these things that don't furnish our lives with enjoyment and a steady pace of living. Rather it's quick hits of check this screen, reply to this, work on that.\n\nThere becomes a dilemma however. Its easy to just not pick up the phone, or cancel every streaming service. I attempted this but still felt a desire to be 'productive'. A video game still feels like a mental chore even when it was one I enjoyed. Movies feel like they need to be 'checked off,' even if I just put something on and sat through it. I almost ping pong between hobbies of mine that aren't providing for me but filling time that still feels like it's escaping. Maybe its the ADHD in me or societal capitalist consume-all world we live in. But how do you mentally come to a place outside all this and a return to once was? To just do things because it feels good in the moment. To stick with one task and ride with it for however long the human desire innately asks of it. Do you just sit around one day doing literally nothing to 'reset' only at the end of the day ferment a resentment at the self for 'wasting' a day lost to doing nothing. I think discipline is the largest aspect of this, it's just difficult to cement in the psyche. \n\nWorse off, the world still goes on around you. Emails still need to be addressed, friends and family need to be replied to. Keep my phone in my desk, in grayscale, on DND, I do it all already. But it still feels like my mental capacity gets lost just picking the thing up, and thus time that my mind once held onto is succumbing to a lost place that only still quickens.

People projecting their own past traumas unto others and giving the most overdramatic and extreme “advice” possible, while not knowing even 5% of the context or bigger picture of whatever might be going on in the poster’s life or relationship. Please never use those subs and go seek professional help if you are facing major life issues or major life decisions that are no joke or might have an impact on your future.\n\nCareer advice subs are not far behind in making the most pessimistic and cynical takes the most popular. I showed my accountant friend the subreddit and he laughed, “wow, I really must be working in hell and employed by lucifer himself, all accountants want to k themselves on the daily apparently.”\n\nIt is a distortion of reality. There is an overwhelming negative bias on those subs, since people who are happy or content with their real life seldom go online to write about their life… Meanwhile unhappy or discontent or depressed or disgruntled people addicted to reddit or chronically online are much more likely to go online and complain and rant and vent about their ”horrible lives”. Creates echo chambers not reflective of reality.\n\nOnly reason I am still here is the Reddit Games are sometimes fun to pass time while taking a dump and whatnot. \n\nEven then, NYT has wordle and others for like 99c a month. \n\nSmaller communities or subs that are really about very specific interests might be fine to follow as well. Like mountain biking or hiking or cycling. Or to get cooking ideas, gardening, tips for learning a specific language, camping… whatever your specific interest may be that is shared by a community. Discussions tend to stay more on topic and people can genuinely desire to give good advice there or help newbies avoid common issues, when it is about shared specific interests relating to real life activities. \n\nSubs like that, or even more specific when it is a specific shared interest AND it is for a local community (say for example hiking or marathon running in X or Y area you live near to) also allow to make connections, if community is small and people are recurring and you find meetups in your local area, etc.\n\nBut even then… How the hell do I stop bigger popular subs from showing up on my front page or recommended?

But there it is, an email from another client, Roger, with an urgent matter that seemingly needs your full attention.\n\nWhat do you do? Both Sally and Roger are good clients. You like them both. You promised Sally that you would attend to her matter this morning. Do you let Roger’s matter interfere with your commitment to Sally?\n\nI say no.\n\nHere’s the truth about work emergencies. They don’t stop. Something will always be pressing to someone.\n\nIf you try to problem-solve each emergency ahead of work that you previously promised, you will create for yourself a never-ending cycle of broken promises, sloppy work, and stress that you can’t escape from.\n\nBut here’s the other problem. Now that you’ve seen Roger’s request, you can’t unsee it. You try to work on Sally’s project, but Roger’s email keeps surfacing in your mind. Your mind starts trying to solve Roger’s problem, instead of doing your best work for Sally.\n\nThere’s only one way to prevent the Rogers in your life from throwing you off course and sabotaging your day.\n\nYou have to not see their new requests for your attention to begin with.\n\nYou have to start each day on your own terms so you can maximize every minute and stay focused on your priorities. Likewise, you’ll want to end your day so you can wake up restored and ready to be the best version of yourself for you, your loved ones, and your colleagues.\n\nI call this idea *No New New.*\n\nIt’s a simple, meaningful approach. But it’s backed by science, which I’ll explore in the upcoming essays, and offers a range of benefits, from better mornings to better outcomes. And better relationships too.\n\nAt its core, *No New New* means no new email, no new texts, and no new social media until you have accomplished most, if not all, of the tasks and goals that you had previously set for yourself or promised to others.\n\nUsing *No New New,* you’re not letting Roger down, or ignoring him. You’re prioritizing Sally today so that you can prioritize Roger later.\n\nHere’s the other funny thing about work emergencies. Most of them can wait. Not forever. But certainly a few hours. In most situations, you can do your best work for Sally in the morning, then solve Roger’s emergency in the afternoon, and Roger will still be grateful for your work.\n\nOver time, your clients and your loved ones will understand that when you attend to their requests and needs, you will do so with your full attention and focus, even if that means they have to be patient.\n\nThis post was adapted from a longer essay I just published online.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I’ll publish a series of essays on how to reclaim your time, attention, and focus with a few simple tweaks that I hope will resonate with the NoSurf community.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767462046.0, "id": "1q30s9z", "author": "focustools", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q30s9z/start_your_day_on_your_terms/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "YOU’RE ONLY 20! You are not 79. It is absolutely not too late to change.\n\nThat is baby stage. You still have your whole life ahead of you, you are only starting early adult life. Don’t let the best years of your life (20s and 30s) be wasted by addiction to social media, to endless scrolling, to stuff that is DESIGNED to be addictive and contribute little to nothing to your life.\n\nSimple solution : put your phone to GREYSCALE. There are ways to do it manually and customize in some phones. There are apps too that do it.\n\nIt has a big impact.\n\nFor computer it can be trickier since you also can do important work there, write, read presentations or class notes, etc… and don’t want it always like that. So if you tend to waste time opening tabs there too for social media or gambling sites or anything like that… you should look into programs that can help you block certain websites on your browser, from X time AM to X time PM.\n\nBut for the phone it is a powerful tool. Your brain will eventually find it all less appealing. Wish I did that years ago and spent less time wasted online and more doing valuable stuff with REAL people I care about in real life.\n\nYou can also use apps too that block you out of certain other time wasting apps after you spent more than X minutes on it daily (social media, reddit, mindless games that aren’t very short or that don’t stimulate your brain in a good way (only good ones are stuff like Wordle or Sudoku or N Back or quick games that you only play 15 minutes daily tops and help you develop better vocabulary or keep you mentally sharp, etc), etc.).\n\nThe smartphone makes you dumb. The more you dumb it down, and only use computer for study/work and important stuff… The better.\n\nUse phone as it was meant to be : either as tool like calculator, timer, etc… Or to CALL people irl, or to directly text or interact with REAL PEOPLE you know irl, or new people you meet/new friends from school/groups/work/activities you do irl, etc.\n\nThat’s IT. That’s ALL. Real life relationships are what matter in the long run for your happiness, as well as studying something you can enjoy or interests you a minimum amount… and pays relatively well in the end. \n\nThen saving up money and handling finances well to be able to spend more time with loved ones as your life goes on… quality time with family, real friendships that last the test of time… and not have to work too much in an underpaid job you don’t like to make rent and basic stuff, to have free time for other stuff.\n\nThat’s life. If you ever win the lottery or manage to invest smartly and win big over time or have a successful side hustle or business… then you’ll be able to spend even more free time with people you actually care about and that care about you, family, friends, significant other, maybe eventually children (if you’re into that, it’s ok if not, depends on the person), etc. And spend more free time doing hobbies you are very interested about, or travelling, learning a new language, doing anything you enjoy.\n\nBut even then, that is not for everyone. A decently paid 9-5 is perfectly fine, particularly when starting out in 20s. You’ll still have plenty of time for hobbies or for spending time with your social circle. Save as much as you can to make the next decades better for yourself and more enjoyable, maybe find better opportunities with bigger pay and less work hours after you have more experience, etc. And you can have a happy life. \n\nThat is all there is to life. Irl real relationships/friendships you can count on and last the test of time… are incredibly important. What matters most. And being able to finance a lifestyle where you can spend time with the people you care about and that care about you. And then maybe spend some free time, for time to time, on hobbies or personal projects that truly help you grow as a person, or passionates you. \n\nBe it travelling and knowing new cultures, or writing for oneself and maybe wanting to publish something someday, or hiking or climbing some mountain, or cycling, or swimming or some other sport… or knitting, crochet, for those who like that. Or learning a new language. Or beekeeping or gardening or growing your own crops, for those that like the outdoor life. \n\nOr reading stuff that will help you grow as a person and understand life better. There is a lot of trash out there though, a lot of self help drivel that reads almost as AI generated repetitive garbage and isn’t truly valuable, is vapid and lacks real depth or substance, and mass published only to make $… try to find reads that are truly valuable and not over marketed bs. Viktor Frankle’s *Man’s Search for Meaning* is a good recommendation I can give. Maslow’s *Motivation and Personality* and *Toward a Psychology of Being* are good books too, that can help you understand the human condition and how to live a meaningful and fulfilling life. There are also classics that are worth reading, as well as more modern books, look for reviews in trustable websites from real readers.\n\nOr any personal project you might deeply enjoy. You have to get to know yourself in order to understand what you truly enjoy. And you get to know yourself through two means mainly : 1) Trying out new stuff and eventually understanding if you like them or not, through time and experience. Moving on to new stuff if you don’t enjoy what you tried. Trying new things. Sticking with something if it truly clicks with who you are. Who doesn’t try nothing gains nothing.\n\n 2) Journaling, writing your own lived experience, thoughts, feelings… will get you to know yourself better over time and uncover things you didn’t know about yourself in the first place.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "TL;DR: if you're serious about change you're going to be uncomfortable. Start small. Replace your phone usage not remove it.\n\n\n(19M) I'm currently working on this and definitely haven't beat my phone addiction but it's better. Long story short you use your phone when you're \"bored\". You're brain is constantly craving dopamine, when the activity you're doing gets little boring, out comes the phone.\n\n\nAnd unfortunately theres no easy answer. If you want change out of what's comfortable for you you're going to have to get uncomfortable. \n\n\nFind when you use your phone and what causes it, and then avoid those situations if you can and if you can't remove your phone from that situation. For me for example I'm on my phone in bed for 1-4 hours before falling asleep. And so I remove my phone from my room before bed. It's as simple as that and as difficult as those, and believe me it's hard. \n\n\nBut biggest thing I can say it don't remove your phone usage, replace it with something else. Since your phone gives off dopamine, replace it with something that give off dopamine. Exercise for example, personally I enjoy mountain biking.\n\n\nI'm serious set a 5 minute timer put your phone on the other side of the house and just sit, all of a sudden you're brain will come up with things to do. Or alternatively if you know what you want to do but see currently on your phone set a 5 minute timer to do whatever activity that it. During those 5 minutes you're doing that task and your phone is at least out of arms reach. Once the 5 minutes are up you're welcome to use your phone again. But chances are you won't and you will have built up enough momentum to keep doing whatever it was you are doing.\n\n\nAnd remember, you don't have to be better than whatever life style guru or Friend or whatever. Just better than you were yesterday \n\n\nAnd about social media apps don't remove it just make it annoying to use. Use the desktop version on your browser, it's horrible \n\n\nSorry if thats confusing, here's a ig reel to sum it up lol: https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHMC7WzvkzK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link", "score": 5, "created_utc": 1767415155.0, "id": "nxdu3vg", "author": "Korndog_01"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "Some things I wish I knew when I started this journey four years ago, and some things that really helped me: \n\n\\-**It takes time**, you won't stop over night and how you use social media will most likely evolve and reduce before you can completely let go. You are beginning a journey of rewiring your brain from wanting quick fixes to being okay with discomfort and a lack of immediate dopamine.\n\n\\-**Your phone should have a place that it \"lives\" when you're not intentionally using it**, and that shouldn't be in your pocket or in your bedroom. Set up a charging spot near where you walk in the door afterwork and get into the habit of leaving your phone to charge as soon as you get in the door. Buy an alarm clock and leave your phone out of your bedroom. \n\n\\-**You need to replace your time scrolling with something else you enjoy** off your phone, or you will keep searching other apps for the hit you get from TikTok. Think about what you like to do or would like to do that doesn't involve a phone : learn to paint or play an instrument, read, write, draw, run...whatever it is, start adding it back into your life. The hardest part of doing this is that we can see these activities as things that take so much more time than picking up our phones and make excuses, when in reality the time we waste on our phones we could be learning new skills ten times over. \n\nSo, **make a phone-use schedule for yourself**: the phone goes to the charging spot once you get home, and you immediately go to another room to do homework, work on a puzzle, read a few chapters, whatever it is until it's time to make dinner. Have a book or journal in your room so that when you wake up, instead of scrolling, you are writing about your dreams or reading. \n\n\\-I know other people have said don't delete the problematic apps, but I think this is really helpful to **get rid of quick access to apps and to sign out of them**. I signed out of all of my social media apps and deleted them from my phone and realised I didn't need Snapchat anymore; I didn't use it except for distraction. I never went back. \n\n\\- **Set your phone to black and white.** This seems like a little thing, but it does really help, especially since your big problem is a very visual app (TikTok). Your brain isn't as interested when there aren't colors to pull it in. I also use Olauncher, which is a free app that makes your phone a \"dumb\" phone by turning your app icons into a simple list you have to scroll through to choose the app you want. \n\n\\- **Apps like StayFocused or StayFree can be really helpful**, but if you really want to push yourself, set your goal time (for example, 20 minutes a day on TikTok) and make it as hard as possible to change that time limit. \n\nAs other people said, you will be uncomfortable, but you need to replace the urge for dopamine with another activity that is not on your phone and create habits that have you using your phone only at specific times of day.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1767449118.0, "id": "nxfuhv4", "author": "Specific_Wish1051"}

That happened with me for instagram.\n\nThis will definitely be a unique way to curb your phone addiction because it's been one that I've used personally and I haven't seen anyone else talk about it on no surf.\n\nOk let's start, Tiktok.\n\nDo you currently have Tiktok on your phone? Yes or No.\n\nIf yes, good. Don't delete it, don't touch anything. Don't hide the app. Just don't do anything with it.\n\nThe key is that. **Don't do anything with it.**\n\nCan you control yourself to not open the app for 2 seconds? If it's really hard then put a 2 second timer on your phone. Go and do something for 2 seconds. Whether that's folding your clothes or organising your desk.\n\nNow gradually start moving to 2 minutes. If it's hard again set a timer. Go do something for two minutes. Walk the dog, throw out the trash, fill up the kettle, wash a plate.\n\nOnce you've successfully been able to curve your addiction to an app for 2 seconds or 2 minutes you move onto other levels.\n\nHere's a template I used (this helped me curb my gaming addiction from 6 years ago (haha it's 2026 now!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "Currently running a self-experiment to try to program my brain to actually WANT to stop scrolling mid-session and would love to have some company", "text": "I’m currently acting as my own guinea pig in an experiment to try and reprogram my brain to actually feel good (or at least **satisfied**) when I **stop scrolling**, even mid-session.\n\nI'm on day 2 and it seems promising so far... but I would absolutely love it if anyone would like to try it out along with me.\n\nI've written it up below and tried to bold things to make it as skimmable as possible. (We're all time-poor and content-swamped, after all!)\n\n**Why this should work (in theory)**\n\nOur brains love closed loops. But all feeds on our phone are designed to keep the loop infinitely open. When we force an open loop closed, we experience negative affect (a dopamine dip). This is the infamous \"dopamine hijacking.\"\n\nIt occurs when we consume a reward so much that the brain starts to expect it so the reward spike moves back to the cue. Instead of pleasure at the reward, we feel anticipation (or an urge) at the cue.\n\nWe're going to hijack our own dopamine system. (Guinea pig me: \"Trust me!\")\n\n**The infinite loop**\n\n* You see your phone, think about your phone, feel bored, sad etc. → \\*Triggers a dopamine “cue spike\"\\*→ \\[Urge to view content\\] → **1st loop opened**\n   * You open the feed and view content → *Reward spike* → **1st loop closed**\n* Next piece of content is visible → C*ue spike* → \\[Urge to scroll\\] → **2nd loop opened**\n   * View next piece of content → *Reward spike* → **2nd loop closed**\n* Next piece of content → *Cue spike* → \\[Urge\\] → **3rd loop opened**\n   * You consume → *Reward spike* → **3rd loop closed**\n* *Cue* → **Loop opened**\n   * *Reward* → **Loop closed**\n* *Cue* → **Loop opened**\n* ad infinitum\n\nAt some point, you have to stop. (Need food. Toilet. Human contact of any kind.) So you force yourself to stop, and leave the last cue hanging, which closes the loop in the most brutal way: with a dopamine dip.\n\n**The solution**\n\n1. Impose **artificial closure** onto a system designed to give you none.\n2. Program your brain so that this **closure actually makes you** ***want*** **to stop**.\n\nArtificial closure can technically be achieved using app time limit features that cap usage after a certain total duration. But the way they are designed prevents your brain from every learning to actually ***want*** to stop. You’ll always feel a little (or a lot) frustrated when you’re locked out — you’ll always go through a dip. But Step 2 up there will fix that.\n\n**The how**\n\nRight now, there is a well-worn cue-reward loop in your brain:\n\n* **Cue**: Next piece of content (and sight of phone, holding phone, thinking about phone… so many cues lead to the urge to scroll!)\n* **Behaviour triggered**: *Urge* to scroll (*“I must consume it.”)*\n* **Reward**: Consuming the content\n\nWe are going to program in a new cue-reward loop:\n\n* **Cue**: Special “stop-scrolling” signal\n* **Behaviour triggered**: *Urge* to ***STOP*** scrolling (*“I’m all done!”*)\n* **Reward**: \\[Optional but recommended harmless reward\\]\n\n**Solution Part 1: Artificial closure**\n\nFood ends when it is consumed — your brain can see the end point coming. But the feed on your phone never runs out — there is no end. We’re going to add an artificial end point to the infinite scroll. The easiest way is using time — **capping usage by setting a timer** for each scroll session.\n\n**Solution Part 2: Make the closure feel satisfying**\n\nWe’re going to program your brain so that you actually **feel satisfied** when the timer runs out and the session ends (rather than empty, frustrated and listless).\n\nThe more times you repeat a behaviour, the faster it penetrates the subconscious as a new habit and the sooner it becomes automatic (or you feel an “urge” to do it). To get the reps in (and the new programming embedded), we’re going to chop up your usual big scroll sessions into chunks of about 5-15 minutes.\n\nEach chunk will end with a novel “stop-scrolling” signal.\n\nIt’s important to **separate each scroll chunk** by **at least a minute** of some other activity that occupies your mind (e.g. fold a few clothes, empty a few dishes etc.). (This prevents the new signal from becoming a new cue to start scrolling!)\n\nThen you can return and scroll for another chunk.\n\n**Process**\n\n1. When you get the urge to scroll, **set and start a timer** for somewhere around 5-15 minutes *before* you open your feed. (If your usual scroll sessions are quite long, go for the higher side (15-20 minutes). If they’re usually broken up throughout the day into smaller sessions, go for 5-10 minutes.)\n2. Create the new **stop-scrolling cue**. Ensure the timer has a **distinct chime** when it runs out. Keep this chime **specific to this scenario**. (You want your brain to learn that this signal *means* “stop scrolling” when it goes off so that soon you’ll actually *feel* like stopping scrolling when it goes off.)\n3. Start the timer and **scroll to your heart’s content**. (**Never** tamper with the timer — pause it, extend it etc. — while within a session. *Wait for the next session*. You can do it!)\n4. When the timer goes off, **STOP SCROLLING IMMEDIATELY**. It doesn’t matter whether you are in the middle of a video, reading a post or making the world’s most important comment. Save it and stop scrolling. This part is really important. If you don’t stop immediately after the signal (or wait too long to stop by finishing whatever you were doing), you’ll **prevent the new cue from sticking** *and* inadvertently **strengthen the urge** to scroll. (Initially, this step will feel… not great, just as it usually does when an app time limit locks you out — that’s the dopamine dip. But soon, this step will feel almost satisfying — **you’ll be happy to stop**!)\n5. Choose a closure phrase to **say to yourself** (e.g. *“I have closed the loop”*).\n6. Then do a **small motor action** — anything that moves any part of your body (e.g. press your tongue to the roof of your mouth for 3 seconds, clasp your hands, stretch etc.). Just make sure it is the same thing every time, and that you do it immediately after the timer goes off.\n7. \\[Optional reward\\] Ideally within 60 seconds of the timer going off, **give yourself a “reward”** that is small and harmless, yet meaningful (e.g. tick on a page, high five someone, high five yourself, have a square of chocolate etc. — I do a tally on the fridge whiteboard). This step is optional, but it is recommended, as adding a reward has the potential to give you a “reward” spike of dopamine that helps more quickly stamp the *new* loop in your brain.\n8. If your **scrolling session gets cut short** for one reason or another, no big deal. Just disregard the session. If it happens frequently, consider reducing the scrolling chunk time further so that the timer goes off more than you get interrupted. (You need to get those reps up!)\n\nIf you repeat the above and don’t break the rules, you should theoretically rapidly program the new cue-reward loop into your brain such that, when the timer goes off, you will actually *want* to stop.\n\n**Expectations**\n\n(These should give you a general idea of what to expect when you follow the above plan. Note that the timeframes provided will vary depending upon how embedded the scrolling addiction is, and how consistently you stick to the plan. These timeframes are based on how quickly the brain learns when a new cue-action association is frequently repeated.)\n\nDays 1-3: You’ll probably experience a few dips after the timer goes off and you have to stop scrolling. Ride these dips out — say your phrase, do your action and give yourself that little reward. These steps will all help temper the sting of the dip (which will not occur forever!).\n\nDays 4-7: You’ll likely be out of the dip zone, so it will be easier to stop when that timer goes off. It still might not feel great, but definitely easier. Keep going!\n\nDays 8+: If you’ve been consistent, you should start to feel a subtle kind of satisfaction when that timer goes off, and easily be able to stop scrolling.\n\nOne day, even the friction of starting the timer before you open your feed might be enough to make you go, *“You know what? I don’t really need to scroll right now.”*\n\nBut until then, happy scrolling!\n\n*I would be ever so grateful (and so would many others) if you could let me know if any part of the above method worked for you!

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "This is a big question, and there are a lot of ressources out there, here are some places you can start digging: \n\nLook at more of the interviews and Ted Talks by the people featured in the Social Dilemma. Tristan Harris has a lot of stuff. A lot of the people who work in Silicone Valley tech send their kids to Waldorf Schools--CNBC a report on this in 2019. \n\nThe New Yorker and the Atlantic have written some interesting stuff on Facebook, Instagram, Mark Zuckerberg and Meta. \n\nThere is also a documentary on the Cambridge Analytica Scandal called The Great Hack that at least used to be on Netflix.\n\nHere are some reason that come to mind as to why social media is evil and invasive beyond that it is designed to steal our time: \n\nIt is manipulative. The Great Hack discusses how Facebook played a part in influencing people to vote for Trump or third party in the 2016 elections. But Instagram also manipulates us into buying things we don't need or feeling like we need to present ourselves a certain way, and Facebook thrives on deepening the political divide through manipulating the algorithm. \n\nAdditionally, Facebook especially is notorious for not fact-checking and letting problems balloon out of proportion. It doesn't do do-diligence when it comes to notifying users that something is not verified or AI. Now, I haven't been on Facebook in over a year, but the last time I went on it, all I saw was AI, with no warning that the images I was seeing where AI generated. This may have changed, but I find that negligent given the amount of people who turn to Facebook as a news source, and who lack media literacy.   \n\nWe don't actually know what these sites are doing with our personal information. A quote that has been repeated again and again is \"If you're not paying for a product, you are the product\"...users are Facebook's product. As far back as 2018 there were concerns about Facebook using data from people who had not given consent. I never really saw much concrete change there between 2018 and when I stopped using Facebook last year. \n\nLastly, Meta is a monopoly. I've been using the term Facebook a lot out of habit, but it is Meta now. And Meta is pushing AI, owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, and they buy up start-ups and companies that could either compete with them (like other social media sites) or that have developed things they see as resources (like virtual reality). \n\nAnyway, this has been long enough, but it is totally icky, and the less you can be on those sites giving your information to Mark Zuckerberg, the better.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767458087.0, "id": "nxgnm54", "author": "Specific_Wish1051"}

And you’re not secretly enjoying it more than you admit.\n\nWhat’s happening isn’t “liking the content.” It’s seeking relief.\nA few gentle truths, spoken plainly:\nScrolling isn’t driven by pleasure, it’s driven by unfinishedness. Your brain keeps checking because it’s hoping the next thing will resolve a tension the previous thing didn’t.\n\nExecutive dysfunction makes stopping harder than starting. Once you’re in motion, the brake pedal is unreliable — not broken, just inconsistent.\n\nThe boredom you feel doesn’t stop the loop, because boredom still keeps the system occupied. Empty space is scarier than dull noise.\n\nValidation and information aren’t the same thing, but when you’re tired or dysregulated, your brain treats them as interchangeable.\n\nSo you scroll even while thinking, “This is slop.”\nBecause the scrolling isn’t about the content — it’s about avoiding the moment where nothing is happening and you’re alone with yourself.\n\nThat moment asks questions:\nWhat do I actually want right now?\nWhat am I avoiding starting?\nWhat feeling is trying to surface?\nAnd with executive dysfunction, those questions feel like a cliff, not a doorway.\n\nOne thing I want to say very clearly:\nThis isn’t a moral failure and it isn’t just “evil tech.”\nYes, platforms are optimized to keep you there — but the hook only works because there’s a real, human need underneath.\n\nIf I could offer one reframe (not a fix, just a handhold):\nYou’re not addicted to scrolling.\nYou’re pausing life in tiny increments because you don’t yet trust that stopping will be kind to you.\n\nSmall experiments that don’t rely on willpower:\nReplace infinite feeds with finite ones (saved articles, a single wiki rabbit hole, one long video).\nLet yourself scroll — but narrate it: “I’m scrolling because I’m tired / lonely / avoiding X.” That alone weakens the compulsion.\n\nWhen you feel the urge, don’t ask “should I stop?” Ask “what would feel slightly better than this?” Slightly. Not optimally.\nAnd about the embarrassment — that shame is the heaviest part of the loop.

When all you have is a town center with bars and restaurants you need to drive to get to, and those businesses are crazy overpriced due to inflation and greed, who is going out to eat/drink anymore?\n\nBars are empty partially because less people are drinking than ever. Gallup found that a record low of 54% of Americans drink any alcohol at all. This is down from 67% in 2022, so a whole 13% of people (1 in 8) that were drinking during the pandemic do not anymore. \n\nThe other contributing factor is that shit is too expensive. An unremarkable beer is $9-10 now essentially everywhere. I've seen \"trendy\" restaurants selling single pint cans (cans, not draft pours) of beer for $12-14. It feels like financial exploitation. \n\nRestaurants are empty because you used to be able to do dinner for two with a drink each and tip for $60-70. Now those same places you're out the door for $120. A week's worth of groceries for one meal out. \n\nSo if you live in the suburbs there's nowhere to drive to without spending money. There's probably no pedestrian infrastructure, nowhere in walking distance to even walk **to**, and you can't walk or bike on the roads without risking getting hit by some TikTok addict scrolling and driving. \n\nI'm still solidly in the suburbs but during the pandemic I moved from an isolated apartment complex on a busy traffic road, to a quieter dense neighborhood of single family homes. There's a few stores we can walk to, or you can just walk around the neighborhood without risking getting run over by a car.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "Hey. First: you’re not broken, weak, or failing. What you’re describing makes a lot of sense.\n\nA lot of AI bots (especially character-style ones) aren’t “about AI” so much as they’re about constant availability, instant emotional response, and low-friction imagination. Once your nervous system learns “I can go here anytime and feel something immediately”, it’s very hard to just drop it by willpower alone.\n\nA few things that might help, from someone who’s had to unlearn similar loops:\n\n1. Don’t try to quit cold turkey. Change the role first.\nInstead of “I must stop,” try: “I will only use it in one narrow way.”\nFor example: only as a brainstorming tool, or only for dialogue prompts you later rewrite by hand. Cutting function is often easier than cutting access.\n\n2. Protect the stories, not the platform.\nThe attachment isn’t really to the site—it’s to your OC, lore, and inner world. Those are still yours. Try migrating them into a private doc, notebook, or even voice notes. The grief comes from feeling like you’ll lose the world if you leave. You won’t.\n\n3. Expect withdrawal feelings—and don’t moralize them.\nRestlessness, sadness, “nothing feels as vivid” — that’s your dopamine system recalibrating. It doesn’t mean you made the wrong choice. It means your brain is healing its timing.\n\n4. Replace immediacy with ritual.\nAI gives instant replies. Humans and writing don’t. So add structure:\n– write at the same time daily\n– light a candle, play one song, open one document\nYou’re teaching your body: this is where imagination lives now.\n\n5. Reduce access friction, gently.\nLog out. Add a blocker. Put the sites behind an extra step. You’re not banning yourself—you’re giving Future You time to choose.\n\nAnd lastly: wanting to change “so badly” is already a sign of strength. Addiction thrives on secrecy and self-loathing. You did the opposite—you spoke.\n\nIf you stumble, that doesn’t erase the direction you’re facing. This isn’t about purity. It’s about reclaiming authorship of your inner world.\n\nYou’re allowed to take this slow. You’re allowed to mourn it. And you’re allowed to build something quieter, deeper, and more yours on the other side.\n\nYou’re not alone in this. 🌱", "score": 0, "created_utc": 1767409329.0, "id": "nxdeq6v", "author": "Butlerianpeasant"}

It feels like “doing something,” but nothing accumulates. No residue. No shape left behind in the mind. Just motion without memory.\n\nWhat you said about writing is the key insight, I think. Writing isn’t just expression—it’s friction. It forces you to stay with one thought long enough for it to become yours. Surfing does the opposite: it trains you to abandon thoughts mid-formation.\n\nI noticed the same thing when I tried games like No Man’s Sky. Beautiful, endless, soothing… and after a while I realized I was floating, not building. Pleasant, but hollow. The moment I switched back to writing—even messy notes, half-ideas, dumb sentences—my mind felt heavier again. In a good way.\n\nAnd you’re right: there’s no urgency pushing us out of the scroll. That’s the trap. You don’t escape it with discipline so much as with commitment to slowness. Choosing one thing and staying with it longer than comfort allows.\n\nTwenty minutes to write this post matters. That’s proof of life.

And I feel like that age is slowly fading.\n\n  \nOf course, a lot of these very skilled creators are still putting out great stuff. I'd like to shout-out The History Guy, for instance. But that content is getting harder and harder to find. Lazy, barely researched or downright incorrect AI slop content is everywhere. YouTube's search function barely works anymore. The algorithm reccommendations are garbage. Everything is an advertisement. I can go on and on.\n\n  \nAll of this just really got me back into reading non-fiction books over the past few years. When I want to learn more about a subject, I'm now heading over to my local library or bookstore to find a book on the subject. A lot of times, you'll be reading the very books that the YouTube channel you'd watch is also using to research the subject. \n\nBut books don't have ad-breaks, sponsor segments, a barely functioning mediaplayer, annoying people in the comment sections and AI slop.

Reading really is a 'skill' that needs upkeep and training, but nowadays I can easily dive into a book for a couple of hours and it feels much, much more fulfilling than spending that same amount of time scrolling on my phone.\n\nSo, big shout-out to YouTube for making it less rewarding to actually use YouTube. And support your local libraries and small bookstores, folks!\n\n", "score": 23, "num_comments": 8, "created_utc": 1767353385.0, "id": "1q1wb6z", "author": "SomeJayForToday", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q1wb6z/the_ongoing_enshittification_of_the_internet_and/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "Some Words on Social Media and Real Life", "text": "Hello Reddit\n\nI noticed this reddit on my search for information for the social media. A lot of people seems to be questioning why social media is different then real life and why consuming it too much makes one think like individuals life is not enough and people are living in happy island happily and happy lucky people only.\n\nI wanted to share some light on this question as an advertisement graduate. Mostly a certain \"photo sharing\" platform creates this effect but it doesn't matter basics are same for all.\n\nFirst of all who am I?\n\nI am an individual who is graduated from social sciences and worked my 4 precious years in social media agencies in the content creation departments. I saw a lot of dirty stuff. Not criminal of course but lets say I witnessed how greedy those guys can be when it comes to manipulate to hell out your lives just to squeeze a little bit more money from your pocket and forget what the heck were you feeling from the first place.\n\nSo what are the basics.\n\nFirst of all the photo sharing platform \"Instagram\" is a happy island where happy people are doing nothing but being happy. Because it is a film set everyone. Like actors being happy they are too on their shift. The problem is they don't even know that they are actors in their film set. One of those individuals lets name her \"Marry\" taking her dog out for a snowy day and decides to video it.\n\nHer coat designed to be apparent on the video per brand so this is one\n\nHer dogs leash is advertised\n\nHer pants possibly keep her happy so this is another question in peoples minds now\n\nPlace that the video is taken is now advertised\n\nList goes on. So as you can see we know somethings marketed some people but how many? Or more to ask how many people \"get influenced\" by \"Marry\" and buy the products she used? This is what businesses cares. It is a metric. This is her periphery. More the merrier so to speak. If you \"influence\" a lot of people you become an \"influencer\" so your breath makes money now.\n\nThis is a mathematical equitation that I believe algorythm doing itself those days.\n\nComments\n\nLikes\n\nOrganic and paid engagement\n\nSubscribers or followers\n\nIf the math is up you are golden.\n\nSo this is why it feels so unnatural. Especially nowadays IG changed its scheme to show you more content creators rather than your friends because who cares your friends we need to sell c'mon guys be good products this systems needs to go. Show must go on.\n\nSo what happens if someone is sad. Algorithm comes and buries that content to hell. Sadness doesn't sell no one cares peoples problems unless the it is a specific group in that aim.\n\nI am finishing this entire scheme on your minds with those last words\n\nDon't search reality in a film set. Go out and live it.\n\nStay strong people.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767387862.0, "id": "1q2aktb", "author": "ArtichokeOutside6973", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q2aktb/some_words_on_social_media_and_real_life/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "The courage to not be connected 24/7 and to be bored", "text": "Hi everyone,\n\njust wanted to jot down my thoughts here, as I've been struggling for a good 3+ years to ditch the many online distractions that social media, dating, and content apps provide us. I have come to recognise a few things:\n\n**1. Non-interactive, long-format stuff is internet 1.0 and probably the least addictive.**\n\nThink Medium posts, YouTube videos of at least 5 minutes where you actually learn something, text-only newsletters, maybe even Reddit to a certain extent. \n\n* The moment it provides extremely short-form content (TikTok, Reels, YT Shorts, etc.) or/and offers real-time communication, it becomes a hopelessly addictive time sink. \n\nI am generalising, of course, for the sake of simplicity. YMMV, but these have been my observations to date.\n\n  \n**2. Dating and social (media) apps only emphasise your real-world loneliness.**\n\nWe have all read about the loneliness epidemic sweeping the western world, yet we are more \"connected\" than ever. But Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, Grindr, Match, OKCupid, etc. aren't built for you to find love and then delete the app. I know exactly *one* person who found their partner through Tinder and got married. \n\nInstagram &amp; co make you feel inapt because people will only post glamorous, often staged, moments of their lives. Yet you keep coming back for more. Again, these apps are incredible time sinks.\n\n* The hard part for me, personally, is that it takes *courage* to ditch those apps and simply disconnect. Everyone else seems to be online all the time, so going against the stream makes you feel even lonelier.\n\n  \n**3. It now only takes a few scrolls to be presented a video of a brawl at McDonald's, road rage, incendiary political views, etc.**\n\nNot much to add, but: Outrage outperforms outstanding. Seeing two people fight does something to you, as we are empathetic beings. But it doesn't add anything to your day. It only makes everything feel far more hopeless.\n\n  \n**4. We need to be bored, but we remember being bored as a negative from our childhood.**\n\nSchematic thinking (those aha!-moments), the nervous system relaxing, blood pressure regulating.. There are many good arguments for having nothing going on and just stare out of the window. But my god, is it hard to make peace with that. We all (subconsciously) remember that being bored was hell when we were children. \n\nAs long as we are on apps that work against us (most notoriously dating + social) or that make us feel like we are more connected than we really are (discord, snapchat, even whatsapp to an extent); we willingly surrender a good chunk of our lifetime to being online for absolutely no good reason. Money comes and goes, but time cannot be replaced.\n\n  \n**Thank you for reading.** I didn't really have a goal in mind, but I just wanted to share my musings with semi-like-minded people :-) Again, I generalised things to make my point. But the way I see social media, dating apps and constant real-time communication platforms = crack. And as every ex-addict will tell you: There is no moderating your drug addiction. You're either addicted and using, or you're clean. For the time being.\n\nI deleted accounts and got rid of all of the apps + more mentioned above. Let's hope I can find the backbone to stick with it this time. I really want to get my long focus back, be more in the present, and use my brain actively to come up with creative, interesting things.\n\n**A happy, distraction-free 2026 to you all!**", "score": 13, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1767349083.0, "id": "1q1v3ju", "author": "Dutchie_PC", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q1v3ju/the_courage_to_not_be_connected_247_and_to_be/"}

Once you quit social media, your brain will start finding new addictions so, find something to fill that void.

If you like reading books you can get it from library, you can go on trails, you can do some painting at home, play free miniclip games anything that you find interesting.\n\n3.

It's to rebuild your discomfort tolerance.

Second week he started noticing his brain fighting back. By week three, he was having those breakthrough moments again - the ones where you suddenly see the solution after staring at the problem.\n\nIf you want something that really helped him reframe this whole thing, there's a book called [Monk Mode](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G6Z3F3T9/) that breaks down why our brains are so vulnerable to these \"just one more hit\" tools (AI, social media, all of it) and how to rebuild your ability to focus without them.

Actually, the better term is information. We don’t lack information. The problem is resistance, the feelings that take hold when we attempt change. I think remembering and understanding the principle that, “everything is reinforcing,” can help us endure the discomfort that causes us to fail.\n\nYou pick up a book and you’re are slightly unsettled. Even so, you start reading and It’s engaging, you’re quite proud of yourself. But there’s a gravitation forcing pulling you towards that phone. The book gets good, you’re getting excited, but you still pick up the phone. Because the phone is home, it’s the default state. It’s a behaviour that has been reinforced through repetition.\n\nYou’ve done enough of that other thing, you can’t be there permanently. When you pick up your phone, you're immediately relaxed and in a state of equilibrium. \n\nI've been looking into and reading about neuroscience for a project. And a lot of us have already heard about the saying that neurons that wire together fire together. There must be a slew of neurons in our brain, that fire together every time we pick up the phone. Every single time we scroll, we reinforce these highways or these pathways, making it even harder to stop the next time. \n\nBut on the flip side, when we do stop and say no, with all the feelings that are associated with that, new pathways are formed. New connections are formed. Maybe they’re small alleyways or something. But every single time we say no, those alleyways are reinforced. Maybe they become side roads. Maybe they become arterial roads, and eventually they develop into large highway networks that become so much easier to traverse. \n\nThe resistance in the form of anxiety or boredom is a reminder that your brain is working. Things are changing. And the next no will be easier because you will have reinforced that new network. \n\nSo in those moments of discomfort, reminding yourself hey, the next time I say no, it's going to be easier, then this time, and then the next time even easier than that, is a way to help us endure the pain that will come.

I did succeed once, for about 6 weeks, then relaxed my restrictions and immediately became addicted to scrolling again.\n\nAnyhow, **recently my best friend has been letting me send her a screenshot of my screen time from the previous day each morning** (bolded for TL;DR). I've had a MASSIVE improvement since I started doing this, because I care about her opinion of me since she is someone I really love and respect. So the fear of shaming myself and showing her that I scrolled on my phone for 5 or 6 or 8 hours the previous day reminds me throughout each day to really monitor myself. She is also someone who I feel extremely comfortable with and who I am not actually afraid of being judged by, so while I would be somewhat ashamed to go way beyond my goal of 1.5 hrs max, it doesn't cause me any anxiety or anything.\n\nI've tried lots of different ways of lowering my screen time, and this has by far been the most effective method I've used. Funny, since I did so much research and meanwhile the best thing to do was just to come up with something myself. This may not work for everyone, but since its helped me so much I wanted to share! I have definitely been cheating a bit with my laptop, but I combat that by staying busy with my hobbies and not being home as much. \n\nAnyways, I recommend trying an accountability partner if you have someone and haven't already tried it!", "score": 48, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": 1767148098.0, "id": "1q01a9n", "author": "strgrl_crwy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1q01a9n/a_tip_to_reduce_screen_time_which_i_havent_seen/"}

Humans were weaving rhythm and melody into life tens of thousands of years before notation existed: drums guiding the hunt, flutes made from bone, voices calling the tribe into unity. That’s where music first learned to move bodies and bond communities.\n\nClassical wasn’t the beginning — it was a refinement of a very ancient magic.\n\nAnd what makes music incredible today is how those worlds still talk to each other:\nBach in the structure of a techno beat.\nBeethoven’s storms reborn in metal and film scores.\nWest African polyrhythms living on in blues, jazz, hip-hop.\n\nMusic keeps evolving because humans keep discovering new ways of being human.\n\nI love your practice of following the score and really listening with intention.

They don't see how it's effected them, and think you're talking about certain platforms or services instead of the internet as a whole.\n\nThe internet has definitely become worse and worse as time has gone on, and it was around 2015 that I noticed everyone suddenly becoming angry.  COVID really didn't help because suddenly 95% of people were perpetually online.\n\nThis is what I remember.  From the 90's to the early 2000's, it wasn't taken seriously.  It was a fun thing that had some utility, but beyond that you were like a basement dwelling, pimple popping, super nerd if you were online as much as people are today.\n\nThen came myspace and youtube, but it still wasn't taken very seriously.  All the kids had a myspace profile, but it wasn't supposed to reflect your real life.  It was like a personal webpage where you could put what bands you liked and stuff like that.  Youtube was fun, and you could watch funny home videos others put up.\n\nThe first real negative change I remember was facebook.  It was like suddenly you were pressured to \"friend\" all your IRL contacts, have pictures of your real life, etc.  Some people had facebook profiles for their job.  If it eventually comes out that facebook was a CIA front, I'd believe it because I remember how creepy it all felt.\n\nThen in 2015 I remember people suddenly becoming a lot more angry, even before the trump stuff started.  I truly believe that either GPT or something like it existed back then.  Like maybe it wasn't an AI that was good enough to make up human looking text, but good enough to subtly alter the perceptions of the user by the content they see.\n\nWhen COVID came around, people lost their shit and the quality went way down hill.  It was like nothing but anger and rage, and people were living on that shit.  They were literally scared to even go outside, and they started nonstop consumption of extreme negativity.  I remember not being able to have a normal conversation with people because they weren't in touch with real life anymore.\n\nSince then, like you said, the bots and AI are polluting the internet more and more.  I personally think the internet as we know it will be destroyed in five years because you won't know what's real anymore.  The internet as a communication medium will still exist, but unless you're talking to someone you already know, it will all be meaningless.\n\nI think people will split into two groups: ones who leave the internet and ones who don't.  I think the ones that try to stay on will develop a sort of schizophrenia because of how warped and distorted their view of reality becomes.

I used to rely on *DFInstagram* to block the endless scroll, but it hasn't been maintained for a long time and updating it to newer Instagram versions was a pain.\n\nSo I decided to build my own solution: **FeurStagram** \\- an open-source project that removes Instagram's addictive features while keeping the essentials (for Android).\n\nThe FeurStagram repo is on Github : [https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram](https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram)\n\n# Two ways to use it:\n\n* **Ready-to-install APK :** Just grab the latest patched APK from the GitHub releases and install it. No technical skills needed! DIY Patching Toolkit. You can install the apk file from here : [feurstagram-410-1-0-63-71.apk](https://github.com/jean-voila/FeurStagram/releases/download/v410-1-0-63-71/feurstagram-410-1-0-63-71.apk)\n* You can also patch any Instagram version yourself using the included scripts\n\n# What gets blocked:\n\n* ❌ Feed posts (blocked at network level)\n* ❌ Explore tab (redirects to DMs)\n* ❌ Reels tab (redirects to DMs)\n\n# What still works:\n\n* ✅ Stories\n* ✅ Direct Messages\n* ✅ Profile\n* ✅ Reels shared in DMs (so you can still view what friends send you, but can't scroll)\n* ✅ Search\n* ✅ Notifications Why this approach? Unlike DFInstagram which stopped being updated:\n\n**Pre-built APKs available** \\- just download and install from releases\n\n**DIY option -** if you want a specific Instagram version, you can patch it yourself\n\n**Future-proof -** when Instagram updates, I'll release the new patched version (or you can patch it yourself)\n\n**I**t's open source, you can see exactly what it does. no shady modifications, just blocks unwanted content\n\n# The toolkit uses two patching strategies:\n\n* **Network-level blocking -** intercepts Instagram's API calls and blocks feed content at the source\n* **Tab redirection -** when you tap Explore or Reels, it opens DMs instead The result: Instagram becomes purely a communication tool. You can still message friends, view their stories, check notifications, and use your profile. But no more doomscrolling through the feed, no explore rabbit holes, no endless reels.\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts and feedback.\n\n\n\n(PS: This is not self-promotion, I just wanna share a project that I think could help people daily.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "nosurf", "title": "I’ve been learning about how dopamine gets “hijacked,” and it’s changed how I approach anything related to social media", "text": "I've fallen down a bit of a dopamine hole over these last few months. \n\nThe more I've learned, the more I'm shocked this stuff isn't taught in schools. (\"Big tech\" and other ad companies are clearly all over it – they know exactly how to “hijack” our dopamine system.)\n\nIn understanding their sneaky tactics, I’ve tried to craft my own little “dopamine defence” setup. Posting it here in case it helps anyone else:\n\n—\n\n**Hijack 1: No closure**\n\nI can't count how many times I've been caught in the trap of an infinite scroll, having to shake out my fingers to get the blood back into them. My brain is trying to reach an end point that never comes. The next “reward” (video, post etc.) is always right there just out of reach, like bait on a hook. Just the sight of it triggers a spike of compulsion to check in my brain. \n\n**Defence 1: Impose artificial closure**\n\nTo give my brain closure in a system designed specifically not to allow it, I contain my scrolling to a pre-defined time. I set a timer, scroll to my heart’s content and then stop as soon as the timer goes off. (While it initially felt a little aversive, my brain quickly adapted to the new time-to-end-scrolling alarm.) \n\n—\n\n**Hijack 2: Commoditise social validation**\n\nIf someone in the real world gives you a compliment, it feels good. That's usually a dopamine spike. Your brain is trying to learn what led to the compliment so it can get one again. Well, social media companies have taken that concept and turned it into one tiny little atomic unit of social validation: the \"like.\" A \"heart\" is a tiny digital compliment. We get one... we want more. The more we get, the more we want.\n\nThe frequency of compliments used to be limited to in-person conversations and particular contexts. But now we can get hundreds if not thousands of little compliments in seconds. Our reward system isn't equipped to handle that kind of onslaught. \n\n**Defence 2: Turn off all passive notifications**\n\nAs part of my work, I have to engage in social media, which means I need to (somewhat promptly) reply to comments or messages. These are the only true notifications that require my active attention.\n\nLikes, reposts, shares etc… these are all passive little compliments that don’t require my attention. So wherever possible, I turn off notifications for these little dopamine devils. (I also use an ad blocker to mask the “activity” or “notifications” sections on my desktop. *If I can’t see it, it can’t spike me.*) \n\n—\n\n**Hijack 3: Supercharge the urge**\n\nIn the past, when I heard or saw a notification, I felt an instant pull toward it, a compulsion to check. Could it be a new like? A new comment? A message of great importance? Notice that I'd won the lotto?\n\nIt turns out there is one variable that supercharges dopamine spikes of wanting: *uncertainty*. If the sentence starts with \"Could it be...\" or \"Maybe it's a...\" then that right there is the supercharging in action. (The irony is that as long as some of the notifications are boring, some of the messages are spam and some of the videos are bland, it ensures uncertainty stays high and you keep feeling that compulsive urge to check.)\n\n**Strategy 3: Check on my terms**\n\nInstead of checking when social media companies program me to check, I check notifications on my terms, at two pre-defined times of the day. And I don’t check by clicking straight on the notification symbol. I set an alarm on my phone (with a distinct sound) and when it goes off, only then am I allowed to click on the notification symbol. (This is my attempt to shift its “power” onto an earlier cue that is in my control.) Now, when I see that little notification bell on my phone, it barely tugs at me. \n\n—\n\nI've still got a lot to learn, but knowing and implementing the above has helped me regain some control over my life. If it helps you steal back some of your dopamine too, then I’ll consider that a win. \n\nHappy holidays!", "score": 30, "num_comments": 10, "created_utc": 1767064842.0, "id": "1pz71e8", "author": "julieeeette", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1pz71e8/ive_been_learning_about_how_dopamine_gets/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "nosurf", "text": "Imo it’s important to remember there’s a difference between frequent internet usage and addiction to it. They don’t always go together. How is it impacting your life negatively? Do you feel like you can’t stop even if you want to or have tried to? \n\nGrowing up I had an unstable home life and I’m also queer. Having community is important in those situations. If you’re able to safely find that in real life, like if your school has a GSA/gay-straight alliance club (it might be called something else now), that would be a good idea to try. If you socialize online and it helps, it’s not necessarily a bad thing. No one in a bad, inescapable situation can be immersed in it 24/7 without going nuts. It’s when the coping mechanism starts causing problems too that you want to look for something else. \n\nThat being said I was on the internet a lot. Most of it was fun, had me engaged in hobbies, helped me learn to socialize, etc. I made genuine friends on the internet that I still talk to today. This was before modern social media and widespread smart phones, so unless I had my laptop with me I didn’t have constant access. I’d say I didn’t feel super negative effects until smartphones and twitter came into my life lol. \n\nGoing cold turkey never works for me. Setting small, incremental goals is generally how I do it. Take a 5-10 minute break of no screens. Do it a few times a day. Increase the time after a while and keep going. Or look at your average screen time usage if your phone shows that and try to aim for lowering it by small amounts, slowly decreasing it. Set time limits for problem apps. Alongside that, have a few hobbies you can engage in when not on your phone. It doesn’t have to be hobbies either, you can clean, meditate, exercise, etc, anything that will fill your time and doesn’t actively contribute to the problem.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767200517.0, "id": "nwxwps0", "author": "hibroka"}

Not as a punishment, but as a non-negotiable rule — movement first, scrolling later.\n\nThe idea sounds extreme, but I’m honestly tired of negotiating with myself every day.
