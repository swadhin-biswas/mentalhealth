I’ve tried searching for information online about this, but no one else with OCD seems to have it. I get these brief pangs of anger that accompany intrusive thoughts - sometimes appearing before the thoughts, or sometimes appearing afterwards. Whenever it happens, the anger is very clearly real. I can actually feel it, in my chest/throat. The contents of the angry thoughts horrify me, but those even seem to be rooted in some genuine part of me.\n\nThe more I experience this intrusive anger, the more I replay it and investigate it. The explanations I come up with it, and the attention I give, only seem to reinforce it and the narratives behind it. The anger seems to be multiply and inflate as time goes on. It pops up more and more. Sometimes I’ll wonder if it’s about to happen, and then it does - the sharp pain of anger rises, and I feel horrified.\n\nI genuinely believe that some of the anger might be fabricated and suspended only by the attention I’m giving it, while other instances of the anger seem to actually be rooted somewhere in my mind. As if there is a subconscious bias or subconscious belief upholding them. And that terrifies me. \n\nI’ve replayed it so much that I can differentiate between different types of anger. I can pinpoint who or what the anger is directed towards, or if it’s directed towards anyone or anything in particular. \n\nThe anger attacks my relationships and the people I care about most of all. And it’s not healthy anger, either. It’s anger towards things that no moral person would ever be angry at. Anger about things that no one should ever be angry about. But here I am, suffering with these pangs of anger.\n\nI don’t even think that the problem is exclusively OCD anymore. Of course, I acknowledge that my OCD is causing me to worry and obsess about it. But as far as I can tell, the problem with the anger itself seems to be a lot uglier and more horrifying than what symptoms of OCD can explain. I really don’t know where the anger is coming from. Or why my brain is getting angry about the things it’s getting angry about.\n\nI can’t stress enough how ugly and horrible the angry thoughts are. I don’t even want to talk about what the contents of them are, as I’m afraid it could lead to me being judged and ignored.\n\nI’m not looking for reassurance. But I do need clarity, awareness, and information. Please help me understand this. I am lost and I cannot explain what’s happening.

(ex theme, fear of not loving my partner, fear of cheating etc.) \n\nbecause of my ocd, i’ve taken a gap year. I attended one day of uni back in september and realised i couldn’t do it so i am starting this year instead. I’m unemployed (which probably doesn’t help, i know, but at the same time i don’t think i can hack it) and i’ve also avoided leaving my house. my intrusive thoughts and compulsions take up my days, regardless of the obsession. my anxiety is at an all time high: stomach aches everyday, frequent headaches, sweating etc. it’s very hard to cope. i am so desperate for help and i contacted my gp to talk about meds. it’s very hard to ask for help and reach out. I know, it took me 6 months to tell my mother. however, it seriously does help to talk about it and asking for help is very brave, if anyone is worrying about it. i know it’s difficult but if you do that it’s one step closer to feeling better and understanding your ocd a little bit more. for me, the shame and embarrassment of it all definitely had an impact on my reaching out for help, but i knew to get out of this hell i had to. so i did. i’m still on the waiting list for therapy for a few months i think but there are things you can do to make yourself feel better in the moment and relax. for me, i watch asmr, i do crafts and i play games with my boyfriend. to anyone reading this who is also struggling i would suggest doing things which bring a little bit of joy and calm in the moment, even if it’s something small.

She used to always sleep in bed with me, or at least my room. But a year ago I kicked her out of my room once and ever since then I haven't been able to let her into my room at all basically.\n\nI worry about her going to the litter box and dragging poop all over my bed (she's gotten on my blankets a few times this year and I had to immediately wash everything because it really did stink of feces).\n\nAnother big factor is that I don't live alone and I absolutely cannot have anything not disinfected in my room, especially if it has been touched by the other person I live with(or their dog). But now my cat spends all her time in the living room, where the other people are too, so its an endless cycle of \"maybe I'll let her in my room again when she is clean\" and \"well she literally can't be clean because she keeps touching all of the stuff I avoid like the plague.\"\n\nIt sucks because my contamination OCD isn't about getting sick or anything, I literally just cannot stand the idea of \"uncleanliness\" at all. I don't know where everything has been and I don't want anything that's not cleaned touching me EVER. Rewashing entire loads of laundry if a sock touched the ground, all that stupid stuff.\n\nBUT I FEEL SO HORRIBLY GUILTY.\n\nMy cat loves me so so much and I obviously love her just as much but I cannot deal with the uncleanliness and the knowledge of what she has touched and WHO has touched her.\n\nTo add to this, a 10yr old kid was staying over yesterday and in the past my cat would've gone to my quiet room as her sanctuary, but since she doesn't have access to it anymore she needs to constantly be around the kid (even overnight), who tried STEPPING on her yesterday (he thought I wasn't watching). Obviously I reprimanded him (even if its not going to change his behaviour at all), but I still feel so horrible that even after seeing that happen, I couldn't bring myself to let my cat in the room with me.\n\n\n\nI genuinely don't believe I will be able to change anything about this until I've moved in alone somewhere but that is going to take YEARS.

I definitely have suspected GAD, but there have been moments in my life where I suspected I had pure-O as well. I had a stint between ages of 17-18 where I was I had HOCD, the pure O kind where you freak out you could be gay. It’s funny because now I consider myself quite heteroflexible and fluid in my sexuality. I could kiss a girl and not spiral into madness or depression. I don’t really have strong lust for women and I just never check myself for being gay or bi anymore. \n\nBut I still have some uncomfortable intrusive anxieties. Lately… it’s been “mental health” anxiety. I used to be more on the hypochondriac side but it was more about physical ailments or like “what if I have a tumor”.\n\nHowever, last year, my husband was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He had a manic episode and I had to involuntarily commit him. I saw him basically lose himself to psychosis. He is doing SO much better now and is on a good medicine regimen, for the most part, but I no longer fear that he’ll slip into psychosis. It was an episode triggered by party drugs, for the record.\n\nHowever, since mid September, so about 4 months now, I’ve had fixations about my own mental health. Worried that I’m secretly depressed, worried that I’m doomed and will never be “happy”. I do have a therapist but I don’t think she seems to understand that I want to get tested for OCD. But I don’t know how diagnosis works.\n\nI also am fearful about taking meds. I know they help people out tremendously but I’ve never felt the need to go on medication and it seems like medication or SSRIs aren’t even the gold standard for treating mild to moderate OCD symptoms.\n\nI’d consider myself high-functioning, even now, but I have still been dealing with that humming feeling of dread or fearing something is off with me. Like how could I have had such egodystonic intrusive thoughts a few months ago in a moment of stress? Doesn’t that mean I’m broken? How do I heal? Why do I keep checking myself with the back door spikes?\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. I also want to discuss about me checking this subreddit.

The breakdown manifested in severe health anxiety, and at different times over the last 4 months I had myself convinced I had pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, a brain tumor and finally (and the strongest obsession) was ALS. I started on antidepressants for the first time in my life at 37 years old, began 3 days a week therapy, and started to make some progress.\n\nFast forward to the last two weeks, and I've really noticed myself stopping my obsession with ALS, to a point. I'm not doing nearly as much Dr. Googling, forum searching or self checking behaviors, which is a good thing. However, I've noticed that my brain seems to not be accepting of that? Now, over the last week, every day I've had a different song stuck in my head, almost in my subconscious, for all waking hours of the day. If I'm concentrating on something else or there's active music playing, the song isn't there, but otherwise it's almost like a soundtrack to my life now, and it's kind of annoying. It's not any one song in particular, it could be any number of songs, but it is frustrating, and it feels like it's an obsession (though not the same level as the ALS one was).\n\nLong story short, has anyone noticed their brain shift anxieties once they've started to deal with a primary one that's frustrated them for a long time? My theory is that my brain has been so overcharged for so long with the obsession over ALS/health anxiety, that while I'm finally starting to calm down,  my brain isn't quite ready to do that yet.\n\nAnyone have any experience with this? I appreciate any feedback!", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768054453.0, "id": "1q953sh", "author": "octabetes", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q953sh/question_about_shifting_anxiety/"}

But it was shocking to realise that may have been a huge sign of my metal health back then.\n\nLooking back I can now laugh, but its also amazing how our little brains worked and connected experiences to specific things and then our brains tried to protect us in such silly ways.\n\nI have so many of these instances, but would really be interested in hearing anyone else's!\n\nFeel free to share your childhood habits and compulsions if you have any!", "score": 9, "num_comments": 48, "created_utc": 1768052435.0, "id": "1q94bsx", "author": "BlastyDavo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q94bsx/what_if_any_silly_childhood_presentations_of_ocd/"}

I'm going through a lot of anxiety right now and crying so much I'm really afraid and I absolutely need gentle compassion and support. Anything helps, I just need to find a way to find a calm down and relax, informing me bad things will happen will actually make me spiral, so please don't say triggering things, I'm just looking for advice and a support system\n\nA bit of background:\n\nI have OCD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder\n\nI haven't experienced loops of negative affirmations or intrusive thoughts in the longest time. I was being treated with Prozac to help the ruminations and obsessive thoughts, and it was able to quiet my brain for a good four years. I was also prescribed hydroxyzine as needed, but again, I've been using it for four years. I didn't see any improvements in anxious feelings though, it affected me academically, sometimes even socially, my motivation and productivity levels weren't always the best, I would have periods where I felt great and others where I felt negative. If my loops of thoughts were too bad, I knew I could just take hydroxyzine, an antihistamine that acts much like Benadryl that can calm me down, so intrusive thoughts faded out and I was able to peacefully live without the disruptive thoughts.\n\nI recently went to a new psychiatrist overseas when I was away on vacation. He told me Prozac can have great negative health effects and is not safe for women my age, and can come with long term health effects, for background, I'm 22 years old. He also states hydroxyzine should not be used long-term and after a few months of use it can become highly addictive.\n\nI started taking Zoloft on the 21st of December, and it was 25 mg. Two weeks passed and I felt okay, but I honestly couldn't really tell if it was working. I talked to my psychiatrist, told him about my loops about intrusive thoughts and obsessions, so he increased my dose to 50 mg, and it takes a few weeks to see results. It hasn't even been two weeks since I've been on the 50 mg of Zoloft. I know things are going to get better and eventually I'm going to feel okay, but during the hydroxyzine withdrawal\n\nperiod, my anxiety and intrusive thoughts are only getting worse. While I wait for the Zoloft to start working, I have a backup medicine I take, it's not a sedative, not as strong as hydroxyzine, but I wanted the safest and least addictive option. My family doesn't want me taking the medicine constantly though, as they fear I mignt get addicted. I just started cognitive behavioral therapy yesterday, and I have to wait until Monday for the next session. I'm really going through it right now, and I need all of my the support I can get. My family and friends have been amazing support but I've been so stuck in my head.\n\nMy brain keeps playing horrendous affirmations and intrusive thoughts in my brain. This all happened because, ugh and I wish I didn't jump into manifesting knowing about the changes happening in my brain, but I really want to manifest my SP.... I was getting sick and tired of her hot and cold signals and I was trying to manifest  better communication and a romantic relationship with her. I thought I wasn't seeing movement but then I was told there was movement behind the scenes, and it happens instantly. I started to manifest things more easily. I still haven't manifested my SP though, and seeing there's a third party and seeing she didn't even bother to ask how I was feeling during these hard times of anxiety, I decided it's time to focus on myself and my mental health. This is not a time to manifest my SP nor do I feel I want her that much anymore as I'm honestly feeling really hurt by her actions and silence. I've accepted it's time if she's with the other girl, and that she's probably not good for me anyways...\n\nI wish I never jumped into this or tried to manifest her, I would probably still be struggling mentally but not as much, I just want to take care of my own mental health and if love finds me then let it, but I don't want to chase or try to intentionally manifest anymore, at least not right now.\n\nAnyways, the issue are the affirmations and intrusive thoughts. I have bad OCD and anxiety that loops various uncomfortable situations and outcomes in my mind and\n\nI'm terrified of them manifesting, I tried to cancel them\n\nout with positive thoughts or say positive affirmations again and again which somewhat helps but it's so exhausting and sometimes it only makes the thoughts stronger and worse.\n\nI try to distract myself and that kinda helps, eft tapping and meditation, but at the end of the day, while I wait for the treatment to work, the affirmations and thoughts still\n\ncome back, I just need a way to quiet my brain, it's like\n\nmy brain needs and wants to think about them, but I'm also terrified of them manifesting, so it's like a war against my brain, please help, I really don't care about my SP anymore, maybe I can get into manifesting someone new when I'm healed and feeling much better, but right now, I just want some advice to quiet my brain and release these fears and anxieties so I can function normally, again anything helps, thank you so much 🫂❤️❤️", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768051954.0, "id": "1q945dt", "author": "Mysterious-Isopod-65", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q945dt/tw_sensitive_content_ocd_issues_brain_looping/"}

I can't even see myself doing therapy in this state without crutches. I have experience with SSRI but I still don't know how they feel for OCD. I used to take Lexapro (30mg) fir agoraphobia about 10 years ago. It didn't do anything for the agoraphobia, but in my my opinion nothing could have helped my agoraphobia anyway, 'cause there was a circumstance in my live (that is too personal to share) that I had to change, and that was what eventually healed my agoraphobia. Now, I already also suffered from OCD during the time I was on Lexapro, but I can't really tell, how much of an effect Lexapro had ob my OCD, since my OCD chanced dynamics throughout the years. To explain in short, back then my OCD was overall worse, if something got \"dirty\" I had to clean EVERYTHING. This had gotten mich better over the years, the biggest breakthrough through that actually happened long after I got off Lexapro. But in exchange for it being overall better, I wrestling a lot with thoughts of \"did I just touch this \"dirty\" thing?\", \"did I really washed my hands after touching this \"dirty\"/actually dirty thing?\", \"did I really wipe over this area of the floor, I did a missed it?\", \"did I really put washing powder into the washing machine?\", etc. pp. I originally never had this, not even when my OCD was the worst. This addition came after one time I forgot to wash my hair under shower, after I got actually really dirty. This problem also got back now when my OCD relapsed. I absolutely can't breathe though these \"did I / didn't I?\" thoughts, it completely robs me the energy to do any therapy.\n\nEdit: I forgot my actual question, well it's in the title, but what does it exactly feel like being on a SSRI and it being helpful?

Anyway, I have this issue where I'll eat the same thing every day until it runs out, regardless of if I want it or not.

Like I physically can't stop doing it and I have no idea why. When I sit there and try to eat something different or try to add on an extra amount because of hunger or something, my brain panics and I start getting really anxious.

He was so understanding and didn't take it personally at all and he understood that my goal was not to make him do anything differently but just to want him to understand how I'm feeling. It's a combination of being really insecure about how his friends think about me (having a huge inferiority complex my whole life I feel like I don't fit in and am not cool as cheesy as that sounds), being jealous that he has friends like them, and I don't even know what else. A fear of cheating is like a tiny part of it I guess. I was in an abusive and neglectful relationship prior so tht is probably part of it.

I was absolutely convinced that my school was conspiring against me (it felt possible because it was a very small school and I was having some issues with the administration, but obviously in hindsight this was ridiculous). I was absolutely terrified to go to school because of this, and was also so angry I was afraid I would lash out and hurt someone. \n\nSo for a while, I stayed home. I couldn’t make myself go, I isolated more and more. It didn’t help that I didn’t really have friends at the time. The only things keeping me sane were reading Lovecraft and playing eldritch horror games, because I felt like I was living in a cosmic horror story, and so it was oddly comforting.\n\nI don’t remember how it came up, but at some point I offhandedly mentioned my interest in some of the games in the discord server for my school’s DnD club. And to my surprise, some people I knew from school liked them too. So despite my fear that my weird paranoid state would drive them away, I started talking to them and eventually made a group chat.\n\nWithin a month or so I was going to school, excited to see my friends at lunch even if everything else sucked and other people still scared me (sometimes justifiably, sometimes not). They’re still my best friends 3 years later.\n\nSo I guess, the moral of the story is that when your OCD compulsions want you to isolate, that’s when you should reach out to your friend the most. I felt like a freak too, but guess what? So did they. They were all weird too and didn’t judge me at all. Deep down I think most people are weird in some way or another, they’re probably trying to hide it just like you.

It is one of the main reasons I’ve never dated or gone further than making out, and I regret it so much. I wish I had pushed the fear aside when I was around your age so I could realise earlier on that those fears were just fears. I kept setting limits for myself: when I’m 20 I will… when I’m 22… when I’m 25, 28… and now I’m almost 30 and it still scares me, especially because of my age. It only gets harder to bite the bullet. And I know it’s easy saying that now looking back at 22 year old me, because she was so scared and anxious but if I could I would go tell her it would all be fine.\n\nI’m definitely not pushing you to do it, only do it if you’re sure you really want to. And if you do really want it and the only thing holding you back are these fears that are most likely not even going to happen, try to ignore them.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "OCD", "text": "One of my intrusive thoughts used to be about sex before marriage being morally wrong.

When we first started doing anything remotely sexual, I would get worked up and experience pretty extreme anxiety. I share this not as an indication of if you should or should not have sex with the guy you’re messaging, but to let you know that there is a possibility you may experience anxiety around sex/intimate touching and to be prepared that your OCD may play on your fears. \n\nIf possible, try and think about what you really want. Do you want to have sex to kind of get it out of the way/try a new experience or do you want to have sex with someone you have an emotional connection with. If it’s the former, please be safe - use protection, let your friends know where you are if you go over to his place.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "OCD", "title": "How do I deal with \"plausible\" thoughts?", "text": "I have been dealing with OCD ever since I was a kid. I remember when I was about 4-5 years old when I would have constant stomach aches and started crying terrified of having to throw up, very often. But things got better when my teacher gave a special medicine that miraculously cured my stomach aches, and whenever I started feeling them again, my parents would give me that same medicine and it would go away. What was the special medicine? Water, on a spoon.\n\nSo even though I was literally just drinking water, it really did help me feel better and I never had a problem with that again. But a few years later, when I was 8 years old, I was with my parents in their bed and they were watching GoT (I wasn't supposed to be watching but I got curious) and there was one scene where a character gets poisoned and dies. I tried to fool myself by saying it was some magic that doesn't exist but that didn't really work, because a while after that, I was buying some chocolate milk with my mom for my english course, and (for some STUPID reason) the cashier thought it would be a good idea to tell a rumour (that was completely false) that someone had poisoned the chocolate milk cartons and a bunch of people were sent to the hospital because of that. My mom already had some suspicions about me having OCD so she was not happy with the cashier for saying that.\n\nLater that same day, I went to my english course and was a little afraid to drink the chocolate milk but I still did it anyway, and of course I felt sick and started crying in the middle of the reception. The teachers and workers tried to calm me down but I was desperate thinking I would die, so they called my mom to take me home. I remember how mad she was, I don't think she was mad with me (maybe a little), I think she was more mad with the whole situation, but she definetly was mad with the cashier.\n\nAfter that day, things didn't really get any better. Seeing how angry my mom was, I started hiding what I was feeling or fighting the thoughts, but I did everything I could so my parents wouldn't know what I was feeling. My family was kinda struggling at that time and my parents were going through a lot of stress so I didn't want to another burden for them. Which was kinda good because I kinda learned how to deal with the thoughts, but also kinda bad because they spiralled out of control later on. I wouldn't eat or drink anything without making sure that someone had tasted it before, and drinking water was tough because everyone had their indivual water bottles and I couldn't just ask somebody to taste my water without them getting suspicious, so I pretty much wouldn't drink water.\n\nI dealt with these thoughts for like 9 years until I had a panic attack in front of my parents because I watched a TV show where a character was poisoned right after I ate a food from a restaurant that my parents had brought home. I started crying and getting desperate again, and now that the cat was out of the bag, I confessed everything to them. Thankfully they were super understanding and patient with me, and conforted me after other panic attacks that happened after that one. They put me in therapy for a year and it was working, I was feeling better. \n\nBut then I screwed things up. I quit the therapy thinking I would be fine, and everything started coming back, and now, it wasn't just food or drinks from restaurants or strangers that I thought they were poisoned, it was also food and drinks from the market and from my own family, including my parents. That and a bunch of other obsessions I had during my life and some crazy new ones that I don't even want to write here. I'm at rock bottom.\n\nHow do I stop this? I know insanity to think that anything would be poisoned, but it's the fact that there is a possibility that it is poisoned, for as small as it may be, it makes afraid.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "OCD", "title": "Only Going To Share What I Want/Feel Comfortable Sharing About My Life", "text": "I like to share some things that go on in my life because it’s one of the things that help me cope with my severe mental health problems, but then I worry about others making false assumptions about my life based on what I share. I mean, I feel a strong temptation that I have to share everything about my life, but I’m training myself to just share what I want to share and not share what I don’t want to and accept whatever false assumptions others think about based on what I share and don’t share instead of sharing nothing because that’ll lead me to even more avoidance and self-isolation. For example, I like sharing how I’m currently doing in online college, if I had a successful holiday celebration with my family, or whatever I want and know is safe to share. Things I don’t want to share are- I’m not sharing what I don’t want to share about my life. I like to keep a secret personality like all the big social media influencers that have secret personalities off their account. I decided that I’m only going to share what I want to share and not mention even the tiniest of what I don’t want to share to avoid accidentally giving hints on what I want to keep secret. That’s how everyone does sharing their life, so I should do the same. Choosing to quit sharing everything over this mindset is just avoidance and will result in me avoiding and self-isolating even more. It’s all about balance. I share what I want to share and avoid mentioning what I want to remain secret, while accepting others making false assumptions about what I do and don’t do in life based on what I share because that’s how everyone does it. If someone asks me about something that I don’t want to share, I’ll respond with something like “maybe, maybe not”, or lie, because nobody needs to know everything about my life, just like most people would never hint at or lie about what they don’t feel comfortable sharing or telling the truth about. I know that sometimes lying about my life will cause some of my truth to be falsely assumed as lies, but I shouldn’t care anymore. Others can choose whenever they want to believe my response to their questions about what I’m currently doing in life. Now I’m not saying I’m going to start telling others lies about my life if you’re wondering that. I’ll mainly only lie if I’m asked something I don’t want or feel comfortable being truthful about. That’s how everyone does it, mainly to protect themselves from uncomfortableness. It’s better to not answer or lie about what I don’t want or feel comfortable sharing than to increase my avoidance and self-isolation behavior. Even though lying or responding “maybe, maybe not” will make me feel uncomfortable for not answering truthfully, sharing what I want to keep secret about my life will do worse damage, like having me avoid doing things I don’t want to share or haven’t shared yet.  Another thing I want to say is if I want to share something about my life, I’ll think about if it’s something that’ll backfire. For example, let’s say I entered a lottery and won a huge amount of money. It feels like something I want to share, but it’ll backfire if I do. (I can privately share that with trusted people though) In conclusion, I should be able to do whatever I’m able to do without having to share it. They can assume whatever they want about what I'm doing and not doing in my current life.\n\nThis post is an update to my last, by the way: https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/s/vXrKBQx65p\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768011602.0, "id": "1q8rur5", "author": "FestiveGiftOfFun", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q8rur5/only_going_to_share_what_i_wantfeel_comfortable/"}

I begged for her back for days because it wasn’t that I didn’t like her, I was just bad at communicating it to her. I wrote a lot about my feelings and how I felt. We got back together a couple days after that and I said we should take it slow and get to know each other better before we became official again. She asked me to be her girlfriend again 3 weeks and I felt really scared so I told her I needed time to think about it. Later that day she said she didn’t want to date anymore and wanted someone who was more enthusiastic about her and that I shouldn’t have needed time to think. I was very upset and tried to get her to change her mind. 4 days after we broke up, I sent her a later and then a few days later asked if she had read it. It turned out she blocked me.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "OCD", "title": "Involuntary Music Imagery / Stuck Song Syndrome", "text": "So this is a lot, and I really appreciate anyone who cares to read this whole thing. About 50 days ago, one night, I started having a song stuck in my head that I had played earlier in the day. And naturally I just tried playing the song to get it out of my head. That didn’t work, then I tried playing another song to see if that would help. It didn’t. Eventually it spiked my anxiety so bad I could no longer be by myself because I could not get the music out of my head. And since then, I’ve been in survival mode at the beginning it felt like my brain was completely overloaded and I was barely eating, I started dropping pounds very rapidly, at one point I lost 5 pounds in 5 days. Everything became a grueling task for me to do and I reached a point where just driving down the street and coming back home was tiring. Early on my rationale for what was going on is I had a few days before stopped taking Latuda because of what was previously thought to be a bipolar diagnosis was then put into question when I was diagnosed with OCD so I got off of the mood stabilizer and my last dose was November 16th. I then started up my first dose of Zoloft on the morning of November 18th. Then by the night of the 18th is when this music thing started. Because of so many different variables at the time I did not know what I could attribute this to, because that same night on the 18th, I had started my first TMS session. So on the 19th when I went back in for my next session, I was convinced that’s what was the cause of this. After my technician showed me that the part of the brain TMS stimulates is nowhere near the auditory cortex, the part of my brain responsible for this involuntary music, I was looking elsewhere for what could possibly be the cause. I eventually landed on it being withdrawal from the latuda, and that was what I went along with for the first 5-6 weeks of this because the explanation was my dopamine and d2 receptors were actively trying to rebalance after being suppressed being on a mood stabilizer. As time went on and I passed the 6 week mark I felt less and less confident that this was the explanation. I then went on to worry maybe it was the Zoloft that had caused this. But that explanation doesn’t work because I was on it for a whole decade until earlier in 2025 when I stopped taking it. So today being day 50 of this still going on I felt a little more down and out about the state of things for me currently as the involuntary music still persists and the best way for me to cope has been to have podcasts/shows playing at almost all times to help drown out the different music that will get stuck in my head. But after deciding to do some more digging I found people on this subreddit that have shared their experiences being something similar to what I’m going through and how this is possibly OCD related. So I would love to hear from any of you about your personal experiences with this phenomenon and how you’ve been able to manage it. Music has been a large part of my identity and who I am at my core and it’s been completely ripped from me these past 50 days and it’s really hard for me to cope sometimes with the state of how things are. My life has been completely shut down for me by this and all I wish to do is get back to normal baseline of being able to live my life again and not have to avoid music at all costs.

I have done a decent amount of ERP therapy, and have pretty good lifestyle habits (exercise, clean diet, barely drink, good sleep hygiene), however nether of these have really reduced my OCD/anxiety symptoms. My OCD mostly manifests itself in health-related obsessions and so I am very nervous about taking an SSRI, given the wide-ranging side effects that they come with. I am very worried about the initial nausea related symptoms, as well as symptoms related to insomnia and sexual dysfunction. I just took my first dose today but am finding myself second-guessing taking it tomorrow.\n\nI am currently in my first year of law school, which has definitely exacerbated my anxiety and OCD symptoms. In addition to my health concerns, I am worried about the side effects of SSRIs interfering with my ability to focus/do my work during what feels like a particularly high-stakes time in my life. However; I know there is never going to be a \"good time\" to get on meds, and that I do not want to live with this uncomfortable level of anxiety for the next 2.5 years, so I feel like I should just try the meds out now and get it over with. \n\nMy doctor started me on 10mg of fluoxetine but said I likely wouldn't feel anything at that low of a dose. I am pretty sensitive to other medications so I'm hoping 10 is enough. My mom has also been on fluoxetine for a long time and has never had any side effects, which my doctor said may indicate that it'll also work for me. \n\n  \nI know medication is a common theme in this subreddit but I wanted to see if anyone had experience with starting medication and getting over the hurdles related to health OCD?

Because it is ok to get reassurance once, but over and over again it becomes a feedback loop with your intrusive thoughts. Like you got reassurance and that was rewarding so you start needing to get it more often even when logically it becomes counter productive. At least in my case it became really harmful because when eventually reassurance ceased I was thrown into a tailspin and became even more desperate for reassurance, sometimes even needing to ask for reassurance less than a minute later or sometimes immediately after I got it. The reassurance stopped being real and was a compulsion and nothing actually made me feel safe. It got to the point where satisfying my compulsions didn't give me relief I just was doing them to do them. \n\nAfter I started setting limits on when I was allowed to seek reassurance it was much better. It actually meant something and helped my nervous system calm down from getting reassurance and I learned to accept the discomfort of not getting it immediately when I wanted it. \n\nI still struggle especially lately, but it's not nearly as bad as it used to be.\n\nEdit: I think you have to decide for yourself though if identifying your thoughts is you seeking reassurance though.

I was offered a job as a quality assurance specialist in December. Upon hire, I asked if I would be required to enter clients homes (this is a dealbreaker for any job) and was told that I would not. The job was presented as a very “typical” quality job (think computer, numbers, excel sheets). \n\nFast forward to this Wednesday, three days into orientation, I am told that I do in fact have to enter homes. I explained that I was not aware of this and I had even clarified it before accepting the job. A large part of my OCD centers around bugs (fleas, bedbugs, etc.) and the fear of infestation. I explained that it would be detrimental to my mental health if I entered client homes. Also to add, this job is at a *MENTAL HEALTH* organization. The supervisor said things to me such as “It’s no different than going to a restaurant or to a movie theater, the risk of bed bugs exists there too” and “can’t you just power through it?”. To which I had to explain to a *mental health program supervisor* that OCD is not rooted in logic. I used the analogy of “it’s like telling someone with a hand-washing compulsion that their hands aren’t dirty so they don’t need to wash them”. \n\nI spoke with HR and was told that home visits were required/could not be omitted as a job duty, and due to that, ADA accommodations would not apply here. I sadly had to quit today, on day FIVE of a job that I would not have accepted if they told me the truth when I asked. While quitting, I told the supervisor that they really should ask interviewees if they are comfortable entering homes, as even those without OCD would likely have safety concerns anyway. His response was “You should have asked more questions about the role since you knew what type of condition you have”. \n\nLet’s *not* forget that I literally did ask if I had to enter homes before I accepted the job and was told no. \n\nAt the end of the day, I understand that they cannot omit home visits due to state/federal regs. However, I wish they would’ve taken accountability for misinforming me upon hire. Their response to the situation was so disheartening and dehumanizing. \n\nThis is the first time that my OCD has truly taken something tangible away from me.

I couldn’t let go of past mistakes no matter how hard I tried and the second I’d start to feel lighter about one thing, I’d replace it with another and be back to square one. It comes from this compulsion of scanning my brain for things that might make me unworthy of happiness (I had my first baby last year, got engaged and bought a house) but funnily enough it was my worst ocd year to date. It gets to a level where you feel burnt out and I decided to start taking medication for it and I haven’t looked back since. I take 20mg of Prozac everyday at the same time and it’s been life changing for me. I am a firm believer that therapy does help too in conjunction with this but unfortunately therapy doesn’t work for everyone due to different factors - it’s costly, you have to really click with the therapist and also if you have other commitments it’s hard to make it to see someone on a regular basis. \nI listen to podcasts on the subject of Real Event and false memory OCD and it really helps to normalise this. It can be tough when someone is like it’s an intrusive thought…yes it is intrusive BUT if it’s something that did actually happen it can be really hard to let go of it and just chalk it up as an intrusive thought. \nIn saying that, thoughts are clouds, not cages.  I have decided to try laugh at my thoughts rather than feel like it’s life or death.\nPlease know you’re not alone and that it’s ok to have regrets in life. You’re human and we are literally designed to learn from mistakes and we can only do our best with what life experience  we  had at the time.\nThe fact that this thread even exists shows how many decent people there are - if you didn’t have any remorse that would be worse. You’re a good person and you deserve to be happy so try next time when a thought pops in that says “oh you seem happy well here’s this memory for you to think of to make you feel unworthy of living happily” say to it “I’ve been down this road before and I can’t change my past so I forgive myself and no one gets through life without mistakes ”\n\nEven if you enter a room or walk down the street and compare yourself to others thinking “I bet they have no regrets I bet they’re perfect humans” you have to realise that nothing and no one is ever as they seem. Everyone has things they look back on and regret or cringe about. You’re having a flare up right now and it sounds like you’re at rock bottom but the only way is up.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "OCD", "title": "Partner with OCD - breakup", "text": "I recently went through a breakup that was largely driven by relationship-focused OCD and anxiety.\n\nThe relationship itself was stable, supportive, and largely free of conflict. There was mutual care, consistent communication, and no significant incompatibilities that typically precede a breakup. The primary issue was my partner’s experience of persistent intrusive doubts about the relationship and their own capacity to be in one. These doubts were not linked to my actions or the quality of the relationship, but to internal anxiety, fear of certainty, and concern about causing harm.\n\nAs the anxiety intensified, being in the relationship became a trigger in itself. My partner concluded that continuing the relationship without fully addressing their OCD would reinforce avoidance and reassurance-seeking patterns, potentially interfering with treatment. The decision to end the relationship was framed as a need to prioritize recovery while starting ERP, rather than a lack of love or care.\n\nWe are not currently in contact. This was an intentional boundary to allow them space to focus on treatment and reduce emotional pressure. I’ve communicated that I’m open to hearing from them if and when they feel ready, but I’m not reaching out in the meantime.\n\nFrom my perspective, this creates a lot of ambiguity. I love and miss them deeply, and I want to be supportive in a way that does not undermine their recovery or create additional anxiety. At the same time, I’m trying to prepare myself for different possible outcomes: reconnection after treatment, a friendship, or permanent separation.\n\nFor those with experience in OCD-impacted relationships, how did you navigate no-contact periods like this? What outcomes are most common once someone engages seriously in treatment? And how can a former partner be supportive without reinforcing avoidance, reassurance cycles, or false hope?", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767993571.0, "id": "1q8ko29", "author": "Forward_Barber8501", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q8ko29/partner_with_ocd_breakup/"}

I learned more about OCD when I researched the character and then looked up information about OCD on the internet.\n\nAnd then something clicked, and I looked back at all the patterns, quirks, and rituals I had, accompanied by all the thoughts I carried with me and that need to control something and feel that it was slipping away from me.\n\nI sought professional help, (reminder that it's important to seek professional help first)was diagnosed, and since then I have received the treatment and therapy I needed.\n\nAnd although it's not a focal point in the series, I absolutely LOVE this series for that and a thousand other reasons.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "OCD", "title": "Is anyone here AuDHD with Pure O (and GAD)?", "text": "\nI'm just learning about Pure O and I've always suspected OCD in my AuDHD 9 year old, but it never quite fit her obsessions (they're not physical compulsions).  So if you could tell me when it started and how it presented in your childhood? \n\nNow I'm wondering, are her verbal stims connected to pure O and I never gave it thought? Her anxiety was debilitating so even after pulling her from school 2 years ago to homeschool, she was better but was too anxious to even leave the house so she was then diagnosed with generalized anxiety and medication has helped her go to places she's wanted to go but was always too anxious. I am not a 'throw medication at it and ignore the rest' mom so I'm constantly reading and researching to make sure I'm understanding what she's dealing with. \n\nHere are things or situations I've noticed: \n\n- from a young age, maybe at age 3, she was terrified of the crown moldings and base boards in our house. However, she was unable to stop looking at it. It was distressing for her. She eventually got through it as she aged but it only moved to fear of lines.\n\n- certain patterns or shapes distresses her,  I understand as I have Trypophobia, but while I  will make sure to throw away or steer clear of anything with said pattern, she will obsess over it, not be able to get it out of her head, not be able to sleep from thinking about it. She has a very good memory so I imagine she can vividly see it in her head over and over. We don't buy anything that we know will stress her but sometimes it may already be in the house and all of a sudden she now notices it and it triggers her. Sometimes we have to hide our shoes because she can't stop looking at it and you can tell how anxious it's making her knowing that it's still in the house. Even if it wasn't, she will have to seek it out, so we can't just put it out of sight.\n\n- certain light switches, that are factory made with tiny gaps/space around the switch, are in the house ( are the same as all of the others), must be covered with duct tape and then covered by a paper but even then she will obsessively remove the coverings to look at it, even though she knows she's distressed by it. \n\n- She needs us to constantly repeat scenarios/stories and made up songs but I always thought this is just a form of communication/conversation for her due to her speech delay, but I notice they're never about positive things, just things that she got in trouble for, things that really stressed or scared her, something bad that happened like maybe a fall, or even made up scenarios of something that would lead to one of the above things, etc. if I try to put a positive spin on it, or highlight something good that happened instead, she will want me to start over and tell it right. \n\n- verbal stims (or assumed stims), are sometimes constant, no matter how regulated she 'should' be. She gets stuck in a loop of verbally stimming words connected to scenarios that we know that she finds distressing.\n\nFor example, she's always had a fear/aversion to children crying. I always pinned it to sensory processing, but is it more than that? Even with anxiety meds, even with ear defenders, even with constant logical and calm conversations with us about emotions or how to deal with sounds she doesn't like, even if she can't hear but can see a child crying with no sound, she will freeze in terror/panic, trying to hold in her cry, get physical with us by pulling in us or scratching us, shout to \"be quiet!\" Or \"stop that crying!\". \n\nSo now for the verbal stim connection, on a day that might not be anywhere near one of these scenarios, she might randomly start verbally repeating a mix of words that are obviously coming from some thought she's having, \"children cry\" \"children cry sometimes\" \"headphones\" \" baby\" \"babies cry\" \"that's how it is\" \"hit her\" \"shoosh\" \"let's leave\". Which we recognize as all words that might be said during one of those scenarios by her or us. While repeating these words, you can tell she is feeling anxious, if you try to talk to her or ask is everything ok? She will be in an episode where she's crawling in the house instead of walking because she's too anxious to walk and she'll respond with a raised voice \"don't ask me if everything is ok!\" And continue. We usually try to get her into a dark room with some soft music in these points.\n\nAgain, I know that's a lot so, if you made it to the end of all of that, I appreciate that effort alone.

He then recommended that I either find a more experienced therapist or attempt inpatient treatment - the inpatient recommendation seemed to be mainly because he considered it to be a more cost effective alternative to me finding a new weekly therapist.\n\n\nI would much prefer to look for a more experienced therapist before deciding to go inpatient. But finding an experienced therapist who can meet with me is difficult since I am very low income and on Medicaid.\n\n\nI have been having a very difficult time deciding on a new therapist. Searching through individual therapists on psychologytoday, it feels like anyone I would be interested in having as a therapist doesn't take my insurance - the people who do take my insurance don't feel like a great match.\n\n\nI have contacted a few therapy centers hoping that I could be matched with someone, as that would be much easier than choosing someone myself. I've specifically requested a therapist with lots of experience in treating OCD - but I keep being matched either with interns or with relatively new therapists who have some experience in treating OCD but do not focus on it as their primary issue. My last therapist had worked with OCD clients before me - he simply didn't have the amount of experience that he felt that he needed to help me personally.\n\n\nSo I'm very wary of meeting with another intern. I spent quite a long time meeting with my last therapist before I even felt comfortable discussing OCD, and while I know that it can sometimes take trial and error to find the right therapist, I really don't want to start sessions with another person who won't have enough OCD-specific experience to help me.\n\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation where you tried meeting with an affordable therapist only for that therapist to decide that they couldn't help you? If so, were you able to eventually find a more effective therapist? Did you need to find an OCD-specialist with years of experience? Or were you able to get the help you needed from a newer, less-experienced therapist?\n\n\nSpecifically I'm interested in hearing from people who found effective therapists while on Medicaid", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767976786.0, "id": "1q8d5yv", "author": "JFox93", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q8d5yv/finding_an_experienced_therapist_while_on_medicaid/"}

My perfectionism has led to major issues in my life — Including a 3 year burnout with daily compulsions. I recently recovered from burnout because I was finally taken seriously and received proper support after a failed critical OD attempt.\n\nI have the energy to do things again, so I do not procrastinate, but my perfectionistic tendencies are still overwhelming in my personal life. I can only see my specialist psychiatrist next month, so I could really use some advice. Here are 2 examples of how my Just right OCD/Pure OCD/Contamination OCD exhibits:\n\n1. I got myself a new word search book recently and didn't test out the paper thickness before use, so my highlighter ended up shining through. I tore the page out and tried to move on, but then noticed the pages were numbered, and the amount of pages in the book is advertised on the cover, so now the book is imperfect. I get very frustrated over this, as I feel I can't use it anymore or something horrible will happen. This has happened with other items as well, like messing up a shade in my therapeutical colouring book, and I can't stop thinking about it until I replace said ruined item.\n\n2. I wanted my room clean for New Year; as I felt the year would start bad if I didn't do so. I cleaned most of it but couldn't get to every corner, because there were guests over and I was exhausted from the heat. When 00:00 arrived and my room was not sparkling clean yet, I had a major breakdown which triggered a TLE mood episode. I kept repeating that the start of the year was going to be horrible and came up with more compulsions as the night progressed. The psychological effect was so bad that I couldn't sleep at all, because I kept getting awake-sleep phase seizures where I had vivid hallucinations and sleep paralysis. \n\nAny advice/commentary is appreciated.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "OCD", "text": "Hey there.  Well done for reaching out - I can hear that you're feeling more determined than ever to attend to your mental health and learn to manage OCD better,\n\nObviously I'm not aware of your experiences with OCD and what treatments or tools you've tried in the past.  But if I were trying to summarise the main ingredients of recovery as briefly as I could, they would be:\n\n\\- Building professional and peer support.  You don't have to do this alone.  If therapy is a viable option for you, it's worth exploring.  ERP seems to be the leading mode of therapy for OCD.  Connecting with OCD peers and non-judgmental friends will be of real support too.\n\n\\- Medication.  I appreciate this is a very personal choice, can be quite scary to contemplate, and may depend on the services available in your country.  But medication is a proven way to alleviate OCD anxiety and compulsivity, if you're willing and able to try it out.\n\n\\- Identifying your compulsions and practising abstinence from them.  I learnt a lot about different types of compulsion from the OCD / Reddit community, including the more covert ones which happen in our heads (like ruminating and checking).  The fewer compulsions we slip into each day, the more we retrain our brains not to check for imagined threats, and the more long-term relief we can experience from the obsession --&gt; compulsion vicious circle.\n\n\\- Learning to treat ourselves (and others) with unconditional love.  This might require a leap of faith at first, as we OCDers are likely to believe that we are 'bad' or unacceptable.  We can learn to accept non-judgmentally the full range of our very human emotions and experiences.  This is often done relationally, which is where a therapeutic relationship can be really supportive.  We can also practise treating our minds and bodies with love, even in basic terms like sleep, rest, exercise, connecting with others and healthy pleasures.\n\n\\- Learning to give up control.  Once we begin to surrender our distorted need to control the past and future, and leave those things up to some other forces, we can return our attention to the only real thing we CAN control - which is the positive actions we take in the present moment.\n\nNot sure I can do justice to the range of recovery tools in a few paragraphs - nor whether that's what you were seeking!  But I hope there's something helpful in here for you, as you contemplate how to move forward.

To put it bluntly, I thought my therapist was putting way too much stock in it. Dermotillomania, trichotillomania? Sure, makes sense. But I refused to believe my refusal to touch doorknobs, guardrails, etc., was anything more than pandemic related anxiety.  \nWelp. That was until now. I had a tier 10 meltdown over a bug touching my plate and my fiancé looked at me and said \"honey, I know you don't want to believe it but you absolutely have OCD.\"   \nSo, with his support, I started looking into the different kinds of OCD. The ways it can manifest and change shape, even.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "OCD", "text": "Oh god, I understand this too well. And it's extremely scary because you would, for the sake of a test, inhabit two different emotional realities (at least for me, which I think may apply to you) and there might be a way to bridge the states -- your stimulated feelings and the ones you normally/logically believe in -- but I don't believe that if you have OCD, it's too useful trying to revisit them. First of all it doesn't cause direct or immediate harm to anyone to THINK about stuff, but it's unfair for you. \n\n\nI think most people have flashes where they have sudden feelings that suppress consequentiliaty (ie; they feel anger without empathy, which they would usually have) but they are able to let it go as a phase. People with OCD are bad at this, because it would introduce several new variables which are high stakes and hard to answer (I want to give examples, but I might trigger a spiral, and I wouldn't like to take the risk, sorry) and instead of letting go, they might inhabit the state to dig deeper into it, or question the specifics of the feelings and what it means about themselves (or morality itself in the existential sense). You already mentioned this in your post. This acts as a positive reinforcement loop. \n\n\nWhat I think helped me was trying to think of it by applying it to other systems. Humans can't generally deal with a lot of one thing at the same time. One horror movie a month may be fun, compulsively watching it every day might make you anxious. You can analyze true crime and try to understand the minds of criminals, but if that's all you do, day in and day out, it's hard to stop it affecting you. Not because you're bad, but because feeding the same feelings can rewire your brains to normalize/accept them as the only thing and the BIG thing. And when you have OCD, your threshold may be lower, even if media cannot be inherently \"bad.\"\n\n\nSo what helped for me was... accepting that whether it's moral or not, I can't always indulge myself to moral experiments to figure out the moral line. Especially when using your feelings ad a metric is... tricky, without direct harm. Good and bad exist, and it's usually measured in harm caused to others, because it's a reasonable position to have. Do what you want, but if you start having tricky feelings, it's probably good to \n\n\n1. Not immediately revisit the triggers for the state (especially applied to when you don't have any special attachment to the trigger. But I'm just giving a suggestion). This is not OCD avoidance, because it's not so much of an arbitrary rule as \"this is not for me, and I don't derive enough enjoyment from it that pros outweighs cons)\n\n\n2. As hard as it is, you are allowed to make a judgement that something doesn't have an exact logical basis for being bad, but you have complicated feelings on it which the subject matter may invite, and when it comes to some some things, it's helpful and expected to exercise caution given their nature even if it's not an obligation. There's a difference between exploring/feeling things, and actively doing them, always.\n\n\n3. Try to stay around other people. When you're alone do something positive which does not distress you (as a rule of the thumb, thoughts are generally morally neutral). And don't interrogate if what you are doing SHOULD distress you. People are allowed to do what they want, privately, and most of society believes it to some extent that it's \"not their business\". \n\n\nThe thing you should not do is try understanding the full scope of those distressing feelings. The urges are very much fueled by fear and (too much) introspection, and you are the only victim of it if you continue to ruminate on them. Let go, talk to people, get into your hobbies, and try to think of those feelings as an accidental (and logical) progression of being human and trying to map things out too hard lmao. \n\n\nAlso, I'm sorry if I wrote too much. I tried to apply it to my situation since I think I was dealing with the same thing, and it might be useful to speak from this perspective. But it's possible you might not relate to everything. Still, hopefully it's useful? I hope you stay safe and happy. This is NOT a thing you have to deal with as a human imo.

I’m writing this because I honestly feel like I’m the only person in the world living through this specific nightmare. I’ve been battling OCD for over 10 years and it has evolved into something so complex and all-knowing that I feel completely paralyzed.\n\nOver the years my themes have jumped from one extreme to another. It started with intense guilt over a mistake in my relationship then moved to terrifying thoughts about being a monster because of things that happened in my past. I’ve obsessed over whether I’m a criminal or a bad person because of how I treated a pet years ago when I was a struggling young man. I’ve been through POCD and Harm OCD where I was terrified of my own actions toward my children.\n\nBut now it has reached a level that feels final. For the last few weeks I’ve been trapped in a mix of existential and suicidal OCD. It’s not just a \"what if\" anymore. It feels like an absolute truth. I have this constant feeling that nothing matters and that love itself is just a shallow illusion. My brain tells me that the only real thing is my suffering and that my anxiety is actually a message from the universe telling me to end it. It feels like an alarm that I cannot ignore.\n\nThe most terrifying part is how my OCD now protects itself. Every time I try to seek help or use a therapy technique my brain intercepts it. If I try to talk to my wife or friends a voice immediately says that I’m just putting my head in the sand and that it’s all useless. Even the love for my two young sons which used to be my anchor now feels contaminated. My brain tries to convince me that the only way to truly protect them from the evil and suffering of this world is for us to not be here anymore. I feel like a danger to the people I love most even though I would die for them in a heartbeat.\n\nI feel uniquely broken. I’ve tried so many therapies and medications and now I’m stuck on a year long waiting list for a specialist. I’m exhausted. It feels like I’ve reached a level of dark insight that makes normal life look like a lie and makes recovery feel impossible. I don’t even know how to explain this to people because they just don’t understand the \"felt necessity\" of these thoughts. They see a calm room but I hear a deafening siren that never stops.\n\nIs there anyone out there who has felt this \"all-knowing\" version of OCD?

I’ve been on the maximum dose of SSRIs (200mg of Sertraline) for years, and because my OCD has been so resistant to treatment, my doctors are currently switching me over to Clomipramine and adding antipsychotics like Seroquel just to try and quiet the noise in my head. I’ve even reached the point where I’ve applied for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) surgery because traditional medicine just haven't been enough to give me my life back.\n\nOver the last ten years, I’ve pretty much tried everything the healthcare system has to offer. I’ve been through multiple psychologists, year-long group therapy programs, and I’ve spent months in intensive, semi-closed OCD treatment facilities where I worked on this for 4 to 5 days a week. On top of that, I’ve had to deal with combat trauma from my time in the military in Afghanistan and a lot of heavy stuff from a really difficult childhood.\n\nThe reason 'just ignoring it' is so survival-level hard for me is that my OCD doesn't just feel like 'noise.'

What anchored me in the moment was the belief that there was nothing my children could confess to me that would change the way I viewed their worthiness to exist. And if that was true for them, that made it true for me.\n\nI also had to get out of my head and into my body for short periods of time. I escaped the thoughts (sometimes) while I was in service to others during working hours. This gave some small waves of relief where I could focus my attention on something salient, something true, something that was ACTUALLY in the room with me. Even holding onto a solid table and saying \"I’m here, in this room holding this table\" brought me back into reality and out of my untethered thoughts. \n\nYour mind is acting as a courtroom and trying to turn everything into a moral/existential judgement.

That we each had a mission to fulfil here. \n\nIn this current phase, you need a higher dose of SSRI. You need assistance in dulling the OCD thoughts so that your own conscience and true wisdom can scaffold against the totalitarianism of your diseased thoughts. You also need to make sure your family is safe from your diseased thoughts. When your thoughts attack their existence as well as your own, you no longer have the option to try and white knuckle your way out of this. \n\nI got out of it. It took about a month. It was so painful and I thought it would never end, but it did and I’m so thankful I’m still here. I want you and your family to be here too. You can’t see it now, but I hope you will.\n\nEdit to add: the level of distress you’re describing deserves immediate professional help and real world support. OCD can make thoughts feel like commands or truths when they aren’t. You don’t have to sort this out alone. Please reach out to a crisis line or emergency services in your area, or tell someone in your household what’s happening right now.

The way you described that internal moral courtroom with no defense attorney is exactly what my life feels like right now. It is a constant state of feeling like I am being condemned by my own mind.\n\nWhat you said about your children’s worthiness really hit me hard. I love my two sons more than anything in the world. I know for a fact that I would give them grace and love no matter what they ever did or confessed to me. But for some reason, I just cannot seem to give that same grace to myself. I am currently on a high dose of medication and working with doctors to switch things up because my thoughts have become exactly what you called them, totalitarian. They are attacking the very idea of existence for me and my whole family.\n\nThe hardest part for me is this absolute conviction that my case is different. My mind tells me that this nihilism and the idea that ending things is the only way to stop suffering is not just a symptom, but an absolute truth. It feels so all knowing that it makes therapy feel like I am just trying to lie to myself.\n\nI wanted to ask you something about when you were in that pit. Did you also have that deep, terrifying feeling that your specific situation was not just brain noise, but a unique truth about how meaningless the universe is? And how did you eventually find a way to believe that life has a purpose that is allowed to exist even when the OCD says it shouldn't?

It was recognizing that my mind had collapsed philosophy, suffering, and morality into one category and then stamped it as ABSOLUTE\n\nMy personal way of understanding things now is that consciousness isn’t here to stand outside existence and judge it from the balcony. It’s here to participate and learn (through attachment, perception, creation, and care of others). To me, that gave me a direction to orient myself out of the pit. I’m not claiming that as cosmic truth. It’s just a stance that stopped my suffering from masquerading as revelation, and it made space for therapy to actually work. \n\nI also won’t pretend I’ve mastered giving myself the same grace I give my kids.

And I finally accepted that I didn't truly have friends or family, just people around me who can't leave because I manipulated them too well.\n\nSo I was walking around feeling like a complete danger to the entire world, completely socially isolated, unable to even speak my own thoughts oftentimes in case I was accidentally manipulating people and it dawned upon me that I would kill myself at some point. I didn't know when, necessarily, maybe soon, maybe in a few years, maybe even further down the road than that, but I was absolutely certain that I would do it at some point.\n\nIt became a really big obsession of mine and my scary intrusive thoughts were all focused around my own suicide and whether I could even do it in a way that wouldn't manipulate and traumatise people. I felt completely powerless to it, like I was on death row just waiting. I kept having obsessions about people who I love finding my body and mourning me. And the fucked up thing is that the whole image only hurt so much because they were mourning their abuser. I had so many ridiculously difficult compulsions at this point too, won't get into specifics necessarily but I did everything in my power to weaken my relationships so that my death wouldn't hurt them. I lost many great friends who still aren't (and possibly never will be) ready to speak to me again.\n\nBut OCD can get better. The most important thing that anyone ever did for my mental health was having me write a list of my obsessions, and then tackling them with ERP from least to most anxiety provoking. When you conquer the smaller intrusive thoughts, you teach yourself that they don't have to have this much power, that you can learn to control your response.

I ended up taking a year break (during the year break i started to notice i was having intrusive thoughts and would have full blown panic attacks but i was able to recognize that it was just thoughts and not me after calling a friend or two) due to getting laced with synthetic weed. When i returned to smoking in the summer time i smoked and everything was fine. I started smoking again. One day i was high at my friends house and i was thinking about my brother and sister not even thinking about how they play a role in my life but just how they exist, and I thought i had a bodily reaction to it. This made me freak the fuck out i thought my life was over. I felt like a sick disgusting fuck. But I also thought i just got scared from the weed. I continued to smoke for days after and every thing was fine. I ended up taking a break when i went up to my grandparents for a couple of days. The first day was fine but then I started to think about what happened when I smoked that day and I realized that oh my god i had this horrible reaction to this thought. And i thought my life was over. I decided to take a month break from weed and at first the intrusive thoughts went away then they slowly came back. So in october of this year i decided to start smoking everyday because the thoughts were so rough and overall the thoughts ended up going away.

I'll share some thoughts and research in case it is helpful to you.\n\nFrom what I understand and from what I've read, OCD is caused by various factors, but the result is a chemical imbalance in your brain which causes the intrusive thoughts and the obsession/compulsion pattern (it's easy to find resources for this online if you're curious). This is the imbalance that psychiatric medication and therapy try to correct to alleviate symptoms.\n\nHolding all that as a thought, using substances like weed also affects your brain chemistry, it seems that for you at times it works for the better and at times for the worst. So it has a varying and unpredictable effect. Substances may also be a way for people to self-medicate (I used to drink when I was young for this reason), so if it helps you feel better, it may be because it is in a way helping, but in a volatile manner. This makes it difficult to predict whether it will help you or not, so it is in a sense a risk.\n\nIn your place, I would consult with a medical professional - a psychiatrist - in order to decide what to do. When I was faced with a similar decision concerning alcohol, I decided to stop drinking to allow my brain to exist in its natural state, because I felt that it was causing me to have strong mood swings and I was beginning to use it to cope with life and getting addicted. I did not want this to become an addiction because I understood I would become a problem for the people in my life, and decided to face things sober.

I will stay up until 3-4am avoiding sleep at night, even now as an adult university student, to monitor myself and my surroundings as to not be caught off guard.

Basically heart palpitations, low blood pressure, and not effectively healing from sicknesses. Hospital visits where i was not taken seriously did not help my anxiety about needing to monitor and advocate for myself. Since this, my night time problems have also become internal focused where I am scared to sleep in case something starts to happen to me health wise that I won’t be able to catch in time.

I am a psychology major ironically and i would like help for what seems like anxiety obsessive compulsions but i just don’t have the time or money as a student.

What that means, how you do it etc. you end up learning over time thru therapy and practice. \n\nFirst step is usually isolating the \"you\" thoughts from the \"ocd\" thoughts. It *feels* like you might have a bit of a grip on that already, but you can actually play with this concept a bit more. Some people find it helpful to personify their OCD and name it to help further that separation. \n\nI bring that up because I think it'll help frame the \"sit with it\" energy Im talking about. \n\nLets name your OCD Nancy - Nancy the nag. She's a lady in her 70s that just likes to yap and yap. And ofc shes gonna say some messed up crap because she's old and doesn't get it. \n\nNow you can argue with Nancy, but Nancy is stubborn. Thats not worth your time, shes toxic. Better just roll your eyes, say \"okay boomer\" and let her just talk herself out while you do better things. \n\nYou're still going to \"hear\" Nancy, but she shuts up eventually. She legit feeds on attention. \n\nThat's the best example I can come up with atm. \n\nAnd also Nancy is annoying - pattern games work really well as a distraction while she's talking. Sudoku or word games etc. If its a game you can play with people that can work better for some too.\n\nYou can also try to take what she's saying to the most ridiculous conclusion you can come up with - How does what she's saying end up with a rabbit in a top hat riding a missile to Bora Bora? That kind of thing. \n\nHope this helps! Feel free to ask me any questions.", "score": 150, "created_utc": 1767937646.0, "id": "nyjqqis", "author": "PathosRise"}

Pretty much he still loves me and wants to be with me, but he’s not sure if we can make it work because we don’t want to live in the same place. My position on it is that we should just try, we’ve been together for 4 years, maybe we don’t live in either place and live somewhere in between, or maybe when circumstances are different it’s possible one of us will change our mind and want to live in the same place, so let’s just try and give ourselves some extra time to figure out if we can make it work instead of giving up.\n\nI’m really struggling with this, and I wonder if it’s partially my OCD or if it’s just standard breakup stuff. I cannot stop thinking about it, not even in a sad way, but like how can I figure this out and make it work. I’m leaning towards OCD and that the whole situation is just a trigger because a really big mental compulsion I do is review evidence, and I’m doing that all of the time, like going over every little detail in my mind about it to try and determine what the outcome will be. I’m just really struggling with it. I’m afraid it’s OCD because if it is then I have to agree with the obsession, which would be saying that we are broken up and he’s not going to change his mind, and of course with OCD refraining from compulsions is always anxiety inducing, but it would also be really hard because honestly hope is the only thing keeping me going right now, I just don’t think I’m ready to accept that it could be over.\n\nHave you been in a similar situation?

Before my diagnosis, I was struggling for years in silence unaware of the severity of my intrusive thoughts and obsessions. \n\nI also had been dealing with childhood trauma after a sexual assault experience from my neighbour. It was only last year that I addressed this with a professional. From 19 to 24, I was a miserable person to be around. I was extremely depressed, and I was consumed by my thoughts, which caused me to lash out a lot more easily. \n\nI also had been struggling to accept what happened to me as a kid. It led me down a confusing road of wondering if I was gay for what happened to me, and even dabbling in gay content despite being straight. I would feel so much shame and sadness after, as I always felt like it was a result of the experiences I had as a kid, and being exposed to porn/sexual activity at far too young an age. \n\nFortunately, I have made some significant improvements, and despite my reluctance to try therapy, I was proven wrong. I am in a relationship of nearly three years, which has had some bumps in the road because of my untreated mental health. However, this past year, after getting the proper help, I was able to reduce the porn addiction that was introduced to me when I was around 9-11 years old. I have also been able to identify my mood swings a lot more clearly and avoid outbursts. I manage my emotions better and understand that they usually pass in time. \n\nDespite these improvements, however, there is still a part of me that cannot let go of the past. I wish that I could take back the way that I treated loved ones during my low moments, and avoid engaging in pornography to the point that it escalated to. It completely altered my brain and how I interpreted sex. \n\nI am trying my absolute hardest to come to terms with my past self and understand that around 19-24, there is a lot of mental growth, and mistakes will happen, but I am seeking advice or if anyone can relate to my situation.

I am usually a mentally stable, cool calm and collected mom of four... people comment on my demeanor with all the chaos of raising lil babes all the time. I love it! I am very blessed to be a \"stay at home\" mom but I suddenly hit this weird wall about four weeks ago. It started as panic cleaning (although I do this everyday of my life since I was very young, this quickly became much more tedious). Base boards, inside drawers, organizing everyone's closets, the junk drawer, etc. But like every single day. Then suddenly I didnt like the way our was designed so I started selling crap and buying new crap. Obsessively looking for the perfect under sink organizer for my bathroom, the perfect fiddle leaf fig tree to put in that one corner, the perfect style of hanging closet organizers...I clocked 5.5 hours inside Ikea with all of my kids one day, etc. But then suddenly the voices/thoughts are telling me that my four year old is going to die. Even writing this down I am thinking, \"oh see now you're going to make it happen\" but I think I need to talk about it to get it out. I mentioned it to a few friends and I thought that would help to make it feel less powerful but its only getting worse. I am so worried that something is going to happen to him.

I text the people I know to apologize constantly, and I feel bad because sometimes they get mad at me for apologizing(but that also kind of reassures me that I didn’t do anything?).\n It’s kind of like I have a loop going in my head, where I am 100% positive that I am a bad person or something bad will happen and I’m at the same time trying to cam myself down. For me, whenever this happens, it lasts for around an hour and it stresses me out so bad. Recently, it has gotten to the point where it has made me a lot more suicidal than I already was. I don’t know what’s happening/what’s wrong with me, but I want to get therapy to get help. I just want to ask, how can I stop doing this?

But OCD is very afraid that I might be proven wrong in my worldview, even with some chance. So, one of the ways I avoided acting on the compulsion was by asking God to punish me if I did it. I ended up asking, \"A punishment that could be, at its maximum, even horror or restrictions.\" And the word \"restrictions\" really scares me. I have dreams in areas where I'm successfully developing. And it's as if they could punish me by restricting these dreams. And then I don't know how I can exist without my dreams.

She pulled into the same shopping center where my office is, that’s where I was going. I pulled up near her (gas pump in between) rolled down my window and she started screaming about how I can’t drive and there’s no turn lane for her so I needed to let her go, very confusing. I ended it with, you’re a rich asshole in a huge SUV that doesn’t know how to drive it. She said “jealousy suites you” and I pulled around the building and into my spot. I needed to calm down, I called someone to just tell them what happened, I needed to chill before going into work. She saw me, other people in the parking lot are now looking. My boss shows up, when I see him get out of his car I walk to the door with him. She left the parking lot at some point. When I left my job she wasn’t there. I was filled with adrenaline.\nThen….driving home the adrenaline dump happens and I’ve been in bed for 2 days now. What if she thinks I was threatening? What if she thinks I was waiting for her? What if everyone thinks I’m a monster? Oh god she’s going to call the police and say I was threatening her? She’s going to get someone to get me….someone is coming to take me away forever. \nI was wondering if anyone else has had a loop like this from a confrontation. How did you break the loop?

I came across an article from a certain organization that specialize in OCD that I can’t name because I think it’s against the rules, but I was able to be seen by them and they diagnosed me with OCD immediately. Once I found OCD everything started to make sense. OCD treatment has really allowed me to understand myself in a way that made sense because at some point I was so confused is why I kept trying to improve and I never felt like I actually understood the issue and I was never satisfied no matter how many hours or years I spent ruminating and trying to improve.\n\nLong story short I started at ERP therapy and I started medication and I am in the best mental state that I’ve been probably my entire life and I’m 28 years old right now.

Early 20s, no symptoms during childhood (except I did have periods of time where I was convinced I had an intellectual disability and obsessively read everything about it for weeks at a time? Might have been OCD related.) My OCD is mostly mental compulsions and magical thinking. I am EXTREMELY terrified of jinxing/manifesting things. Not in a cute “oh haha don’t count your eggs before they hatched way”, but in a way that makes me isolated and unable to talk about my problems with people. If I say anything negative I’m “manifesting it”. If I talk positively about something I jinx it and get bad luck. I have friends but I don’t tell them things because I’m so afraid of getting jinxed. Im even scared to vocalize hypothetical bad scenarios. For example, talking about getting fired I can’t say the word “fired” because the universe is listening to me and wants that to happen. If I do have to say it I have to say “I rebuke all evil spirits” a few times. Im not even religious or spiritual. It just feels like everything is evil and out to get me?\n\nI’m obsessed with luck. I refuse to eat buldak ramen because something bad happened to me once and now I think it’s cursed. I have to wear a specific brand of mascara when I go on dates not because I want to look cute, but because if I don’t wear it the guy won’t like me anymore. It’s not really about the mascara, it could be something like having to wear white socks or a hair tie on my right wrist. \n\nI hate this because I know it’s all irrational. Eating buldak ramen will not cause my grandma to d*e. Rain on a first date doesn’t necessarily mean there won’t be a second one.

All it is, is exposure response therapy, so, exposing yourself to triggers, monitoring your response (example: touching a contaminated object and not washing your hands until after 30 seconds). Eventually, your brain will register that the object isn’t contaminated like you originally thought. There’s plenty of ways to preform exposure response practices. Now, it is OVERWHELMING, especially with ocd that has multiple triggers and compulsions so it can’t by any means all be completed at once. It’s a process for sure. Not to scare you, but it does take time. I don’t know much about ICBT though because my ocd is based in perfectionistic rituals and contamination, so I haven’t really had to undergo that type of therapy \n\nAs far as looking for a therapist, it’s trial and error, no matter what you’re dealing with.

However, sometimes we have to force ourselves to do things that are uncomfortable for growth! im not sure how your family dynamic is, but i would suggest eating your meals away from the table if you are able to. would you be able to stand in the kitchen and eat? Another suggestion i have is you could always freeze the food for later. freezing often times kills some bacteria and when you reheat the food, it will kill off more. I would suggest still eating the food, but maybe give yourself a different space or setting to eat it later on. \n\nThe exposure of eating the food even after its been \"exposed to contamination\" and being okay after will help your ocd. But allowing yourself space in the moment when your feelings are the most heightened, and saving your food for later will give you time to settle on your emotions and work up the courage to finish eating!! \n\nIt sounds very hard and unconventional, but i had a similar compulsions where I could not eat anything that had been inside a fridge because I was afraid of mold spores. The only way I was able to realize that I am gonna be okay, is i actually ate a mold infested peice of broccoli on accident. I had a full blown panic attack and thought I was going to die.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "OCD", "text": "Hey, fellow contamination OCD sufferer here who had to do this and was freaking about it, too. Here are some tips:\n\nThe lab should give you a kit for stool sample collection that includes something called a “toilet hat”. It’s a disposable plastic bowl that goes in between the toilet seat and the toilet bowl so you can catch the poo sample. Here’s a good [step-by-step guide](https://www.romanwell.com/blog/how-to-do-a-stool-test-in-10-simple-steps) for how to do it. This will prevent you from getting poo anywhere in your bathroom or on yourself. \n\nI’m not gonna lie, the hardest part for me was the transfer of the poo from the bowl to the little container they give you. It was pretty unpleasant and I had to plug my nose to be able to do it and I really struggled. But I did eventually manage to get the sample. Definitely use a nose plug if you have to, due to the smell. Breathe through your mouth if you can. \n\nMake sure to prepare well in advance and have everything (collection kit, etc.) ready in the bathroom before you begin. Get several pairs of disposable gloves as well as a trash bag (open it in advance btw!! you don’t want to be fiddling with it trying to get it open while you’re in the middle of things… trust me) to get rid of the bowl with the rest of the poo in it once you have collected the sample. I also had a paper lunch bag to put the sample container in after collection so I wouldn’t have to look at it after lol. Also made sure to take the trash bag straight to the dumpster after I was done so it wouldn’t sit in my garbage. \n\nI don’t know your living situation, but another thing I’d do is to be sure you have privacy and plenty of time without anyone who needs to use the bathroom bothering you or barging in etc. The less external stressors you have the better. It sounds like such a small thing but believe me, it’s hugely helpful. \n\nI would also recommend not eating anything right or close before you collect the sample so there’s less of a chance of vomiting. The best time to do it is right after you wake up in the morning imo, but it’s up to you whenever you’re most comfortable. \n\nWhen you’re done collecting the poo sample, take it to the lab as soon as possible. You don’t want it sitting out and possibly making the sample unusable due to bacteria growth, contamination, etc. Then you’ll have to do the whole thing over again. \n\nGood luck and I hope everything goes well for you!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767898984.0, "id": "nyg8frg", "author": "pashed_motatoes"}

Take it one day at a time, the more emphasis and fear u put on a thought the more power it holds.

I’m 27F, and I don’t think I’ve ever felt this kind of loneliness before.\n\n\n\nSince childhood, I’ve always struggled to connect with people. I was the quiet, loner kid in school \n\n\n\nI’ve always suspected I have an avoidant attachment style. I’m in therapy now, but even there I struggle, I find it really hard to open up and trust my therapist. It depends on my state and it comes and goes, depending. I also am diagnosed with OCD, depression, and social anxiety, so just being around people is hard for me sometimes.\n\n\n\nAbout a year and a half ago, something happened that I still can’t get over. I had one real friend, my first real, deep friendship ever, and we met back in university(2014). We got really close, especially when we both started therapy around 2021. For two years, from 2021 to 2023, we were inseparable. We hung out every day, shared everything, family struggles, work stress, even deeper gender identity issues we both related to. I felt understood for the first time in my life.\n\n\n\nBut then, in 2023, things started to change. She moved out of her parents’ place and started living with two other girls. I was devastated. I felt jealous all the time when she was having fun with them. Meanwhile, I was still living in my traumatized home, barely leaving the house except for therapy. I worked freelance, so I basically had no social life at all. She, on the other hand, started going out more, meeting new people, dating (girls), expanding her world.\n\n\n\nTo her credit, she always tried to include me. I tried too, for almost a year i tried to go out, to meet her friends, but my anxiety made it almost impossible. Eventually, I started feeling like she was moving on, while I was stuck.\n\n\n\nThen I got… obsessed. My OCD worsened. I would check her Instagram stories, her friends’ profiles, even her girlfriend’s page, literally every hour. I’d reread our old messages and look at our photos from 2021–2023 until I’d cry. It felt like my only safe place had disappeared. We were fighting all the time,, mostly because of my emotions. I wasn’t being dramatic, i never am, it’s just that she knew me so well, she could see through everything. She tried to help, but I couldn’t stop feeling abandoned.\n\n\n\nI’ve had moments where I thought maybe I’m in love with her, but maybe it’s just that she was the only person who ever made me feel safe and seen. I honestly don’t know the difference anymore. I get triggered every time she posts a story with someone else, even though she still checks in with me and tries to involve me.\n\n\n\nShe’s happy now, she is in a way better place, and I’m happy for her. But I’m still stuck. I feel like I lost the only person who ever truly understood me. Sometimes the pain gets so bad I just don’t want to exist anymore.\n\n\n\nI talk about this in therapy sometimes, but it’s too painful. I end up sobbing every time.\n\n\n\nCan someone please tell me what does this mean? Is it love, or is it an attachment issue? And how do you even start healing from something like this when it feels like your whole sense of safety was tied to one person?", "score": 3, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1767879697.0, "id": "1q7c37b", "author": "Aggressive_Act_5874", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q7c37b/i_got_attached_to_one_person_and_now_im_falling/"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "OCD", "text": "\"I honestly don't even know the difference anymore.\" That line really hits home and I understand exactly where you are coming from. This is the most difficult part or ruminating and OCD. It feels like you can think your way to a solution, but it never comes, and you are left feeling like you have to think even more to get to the answer. Then the feelings pop in and throw everything off, now you question your feelings and evaluate again... I get it, and I get the lonely feeling of wanting to know about other people's lives. It can even happen to me when watching shows or movies, especially if the theme hits home (dealing with that currently).\n\nMy advice to you right now would just be to not check up on her social media or look up anything related to her for a while. I know that's hard but sometimes it can give your mind a break and let yourself process the pain. It's okay to accept that you might not know exactly what your feeling about all of this right now, but trust yourself that eventually you will move past this and grow from it. Try to see this as a guide to further develop as a person. I know that's annoying to hear, but I understand where you're coming from in feeling lonely and confused about everything.

The basal ganglia is also responsible for those random \"twitches\" your bodily physically does and those involuntary movements. Below is a text I quoted from a book I'm currently reading:\n\n\"Harvard’s Roger Pitman suggests a helpful analogy: The basal ganglia works like a computer using a match-mismatch mechanism to identify certain thoughts that are of special importance for survival—specifically, those conveying a danger message. In the basal ganglia, an image or idea is compared against preexisting wishes, fears, and memory traces. If there is a match, the thought harmonizes with associations about the self and the world, and it is dismissed from consciousness. If there is not a match, the idea is returned to the cortical areas of the brain for further conscious appraisals. Normally, an idea is dismissed when it should be—when, through conscious reflection, an individual realizes that danger does not lurk. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, however, the idea is kept in strong conscious awareness long after the individual himself knows that it should be dismissed.\"\n\n", "score": 5, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1767879206.0, "id": "1q7bwhm", "author": "Head-Ad-449", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q7bwhm/ocd_and_the_brain/"}

I’m worried I can’t get out because what’s troubling me would be upsetting to most people but to the degree it is with me? Probably not. I won’t go into details about it specifically because I know venting isn’t good and because I’m aware of how it sounds and how the illness works. But I’m still stuck. I know there’s something I’m afraid of I need to let go of or whatever but it seems impossible to just force that? \n\n(I take as many calming supplements as I can but I’ll never touch a SSRI due to permanent sexual side effects if anyone wants to suggest those. Sorry and I read plenty of good ocd books so idk what therapy could offer. I don’t believe much unless I could afford a specialist which I can’t and I’m embarrassed to go. Like I said my wife doesn’t know much as she is part of my ocd problem I’d hate to make her feel bad but I can’t hide my distress from her much anymore. Sometimes I just hold her and cry I hurt so bad, it feels pathetic. \n\nThe last 2 weeks have been by far the worst of my experience with ocd I think and honestly after 2 years i didn’t think it could get worse. I’ve been bedridden and smoke weed most all day just to loosen my muscle tension/anxiety some because I’ve been literally locked up like I’m so anxious and afraid and sad I can’t move. Weed hardly helps anymore it’s so intense. Watching tv I just stare blankly ruminating in my head. I hate/love sleeping because it turns my brain off but hate it because that means waking up and feeling that awful anxiety hit when I do. \n\nMy wife’s been understanding though she doesn’t know about my ocd specifically just that I’ve been depressed but I know she’s lonely and worried. I can barely keep a conversation or thought present with her I ruminate so much. Every chance I get really. I can stop for awhile but not forever. Eventually a thought hurts too much and it’s back to it. That’s my issue is I’ve fallen so many times over the last few years and any attempts to stand up feels like a waste because statistically I will fail again. What’s changed this time? \n\nSo what’s left for me? At this rate run out of money from not being able to work and embarrass myself. Lose touch with everyone because I’m so lost in my mind I can’t properly interact?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "OCD", "text": "im really sorry you're going through this. look, this is my personal opinion after reading through your situation so don't take this the wrong way like im ignoring how you said your wife is part of your ocd problems, but I think you really need to just be honest with her. 1. i think you need to tell someone what's actually going on with you, someone who knows you and someone who will actually care. trying to keep it to yourself is really bad for ocd because we can't actually trust our own minds and things get all misconstrued inside. It needs to be said out loud and i think not only will this bring you immense relief, it will give you some kind of soundboard to bounce your thoughts off. if she dosen't know much about ocd, explain it first before getting into your actual issues so she has background knowledge if you're worried about her thinking of you in some kind of way. Remember, you just have ocd, ocd isn't who you are. Most people don't know what ocd is actually about, heck i also used to think it was overwashing your hands or whatever. 2. she's clearly in distress and lonely because you won't open up to her and putting strain on your relationship. opening up can only make things better, i mean, it's only going to deteriorate at this point, right? the only way forward is through all this and together. bet on your relationship, cause even if the worst happens, the current status quo is clearly not working. To me it sounds like you don't have much left to lose. trust me, i've been there trying to put on a facade around those close to me and it never ends well, ive been practicing being more honest to people even at the risk of them turning away, and I feel much better being my authentic self around others. it's still a work in progress, but i think people can sense when you're hiding things anyway so you're gonna feel off to others regardless. \n\nAs for medicine, my suggestion is go to a doctor and state your boundaries. tell them you won't risk the side effects of ssris and ask for alternatives. They can't make you take anything. don't be deterred if the first doctor has nothing else to offer. health care varies so much based on each practicioner just like therapists. shop around a bit for a doctor who gets you. GPs will often have knowledge on holistic approaches too, whether that be diet changes to lower stress, mindful practices, they might suggest yoga or some type of specific physical activity related to breathing. most importantly you need to get a blood test if you haven't recently. deficincies can mess with your head majorly. i had low vit d and it was taking things from worse to worst. \n\nthat's all i can realy say. this disease is sht and i should really take my own advice but im distracting myself with replying to you instead haha. i wish you the best, please don't handle this alone, create a support system by letting your wife know and finding trusted healthcare workers. you've got this.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767880314.0, "id": "nyebrx5", "author": "ActualAssociation184"}

I started out at 10 doing rituals and compulsions for about a year, then later in life it came back as intrusive thoughts, and various coping mechanisms. \n\nIs there something specific your thoughts are showing/doing/saying, are they directed towards you? (antagonistic, self deprecating) or do they seem more anxiety riddled, worried about situational issues like career/lifestyle/future,etc? For me, my intrusive thoughts have come in situations where huge life changes are about to take place. I've always struggled to get out of my comfort zone in big ways and take chances so when say a big move to another state or a full on flip of what you know can cause those thoughts to start fighting to keep the status quo, and keep you locked up. \n\nIs there anything big that you've dealt with recently, personally?

Meditation helps me too, I try to do at least 10min a day to just ground myself. \n\nI know this sucks, all too well.

The one I remember most vividly was when they wouldn't pass me the ball in soccer, calling them \"sexist.\" At that time, I was being bullied and had just come out of another harassment incident, so I guess I was sensitive. \n\nThe thing is, the OCD has taken that and told me \"you weren't a stupid girl, you shouldn't have behaved like that, you knew what you were doing, and you should take responsibility for it.\"\n\n I'm almost 20; I'm not a child, but I'm not a full-fledged adult either, and I'm certainly not the most mature person.

I've been living in hell for the past three years. Every morning I wake up with some kind of obsession or tension in my head. It's quite difficult to describe. Incredibly strong tension, mental and emotional. Something that is impossible to tolerate. You can't distract yourself from it. No matter what I do, no matter how I distract myself, it always wins. I would call it a meaningless obsession. During the day, it builds up, and after 4-5 hours after waking up, the feeling is strong enough to endure. But I continue to endure it, hoping that I will come up with something. After about seven hours, I start overeating. I can't say that this is exactly compulsive overeating, because I don't consume food at an incredible rate, but I eat everything I can until physical pain sets in. I can't explain why this senseless obsession is specifically related to food. I probably chose this method three years ago and formed strong neural connections in my head. I eat normally throughout the day and don't restrict myself; I don't have a restrictive eating disorder. I simply use food as a way to cope with this feeling. If at the beginning of my illness I did this once a week, now I overeat every day and spend 80% of my income on it. I have OCD, closer to pure OCD, and I understand how it works.\nI'm in stable remission and it rarely bothers me. I assume that all my obsessions were clearly connected to something, but here it's simply an initially unrelated, unbearable obsessive tension in my head. When I can't stand it, I commit a compulsion and overeat huge portions of food. With my OCD, I was afraid of something and created compulsions to avoid it, and I understand the logic, but in the case of food, there is no initial anxiety. The tension itself is empty and unrelated. It's just always been with me for three years. It hasn't gone away for a second, but my episodes of binge eating suppressed it for a while. Previously, it would last a week, and now it's one day. I don't want to wake up in the morning knowing that I'll have to face this feeling again, which is destroying me from the inside. I don't want to complain, guys, but my life is hell right now. I'm a hostage to this internal tension, and it makes me cry every day. Maybe you can help me. Maybe it's not OCD at all.

I explained this to them, they didn’t really say much and it was never mentioned again until MONTHS later when my mental health started to deteriorate enough for them to care.\n\nI told them it was because I get bullied a lot and it’s making me hate myself, and backed it up with the time they found out i’ve been hurting myself but the true reason was because I’ve been having some really bad thoughts (POCD) that i knew i didn’t actually want and i really need help. I couldn’t tell them that, though, because how do i tell them i’m starting to believe i’m a pedo at the ripe old age of 14?? (i’m 16 now fyi)\n\nBut anyways I went for about 9 sessions a week on and off, and after I explained everything to my therapist she told me I definitely have OCD. During these sessions, I felt like I was finally getting somewhere, finally having an unbiased person to talk to when all of a sudden my parents decide to just stop taking me. They kept giving me excuses like “oh we have work that day and no else can take you,” or “was therapy even helping you? Was there a point? I don’t see any difference.” At that point, I just stopped asking.\n\nI really wish I could go back, I keep having these horrible thoughts and I need to talk to someone about them. I wake up and go to sleep every knight feeling disgusted with myself. I feel shame, unclean. I don’t know how else to explain it.

Like what do they expect me to do? Grab a time machine and go back in time? Even then it wouldn’t be possible because during the false confession. I didn’t even know the timeframe of when this Allegedly Happened.\n\nI also feel so overly fixated on attempting to disprove the accusations. Because it really impacted my reputation. And even some people are choosing to not associate themselves with me anymore.\n\nI was even banned from massive games / discord servers due to these accusations.

Neither do i even really know myself if it’s fake or not.\n\nI assume it is because some details weren’t clear &amp; also because it’s completely out of my character.\nand also the fact that i've spent weeks ruminating on it before hand. But obviously i can’t prove that to people.\nAnd because i sounded so sure during the confession. It’s being used against me\nSome people think i'm using it as a shield. And some people think that i'm not.\n\nSo i don’t really know what to think of that.\nRegardless. I just find it impossible to move on. It’s been more than a year &amp; i'm still in the same spot than i was before. Only difference is that i'm feeling worse and that the situation has gotten worse.\n\nI'm sorry for this long post. I just felt the need to talk about it.\n\nI am fully aware that ocd doesn’t fully excuse the things I’ve claimed to have done. And i still take the responsibility for the things i've said. I'm simply making it very clear that the things I’ve claimed to have done were simply inaccurate.\n\nI'm also fully aware that i do need mental help. OBVIOUSLY. So i'm still searching for help &amp; i will see if i get to setup an appointment for this month or next month if possible.\n\nI've been really trying to get help. It just feels difficult to find someone who has time for you.\n\nHowever what i find critically wrong and foolish is how people claim i'm mainly a danger to society and that i'm a disgusting person.\n\nIt leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Including the ones with taboo themes.\n\nBut regardless this is all that i want to say for now.\n\nIf you guys have any similar stories or situations like this. Feel free to talk about it in the comment section. But just a trigger warning. You shouldn’t do it if you feel like it might trigger your ocd again. The only reason i'm asking is mainly out of pure curiosity &amp; maybe it can help me feel less alone.\n\nAnd if any of you could relate to my pain or what i'm feeling.\nI truly hope the best for you &amp; pray that you heal as soon as possible \nAnd live a happy life filled with joy.\n\nThank you everyone for reading my post ❤️", "score": 12, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767830361.0, "id": "1q6w4gv", "author": "Hot-Class2066", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1q6w4gv/i_despise_my_ocd_heres_why/"}

Then my classmate told me that her aunt got many cysts along her breast and arm that were cancerous and had to be removed. A cherry on top of all of this, i have inverted nipples. I have ALWAYS had them. My classmate whom im closer to said that inverted nipples can also be a sign of breast cancer. Maybe im being irrational, but now im quite scared.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "OCD", "title": "OCD and asking what reality even is", "text": "For the past few months I’ve been stuck in a false memory OCD loop that kept escalating its intensity/factors of worry, and I’ve gotten to a point where I doubt reality itself. If I can’t prove which of my memories and/or mental images are real or fake, then how can I prove what my reality is? The remedy to OCD is to accept the uncertainty, but living with the uncertainty often makes me live as if what I feared happened really happened, and deal with “consequences”. \n\nAnd so now I’m in a quantum-like Schrodinger’s Cat sort of situation - in between a reality where it didn’t happen and a ‘reality ‘ where it did. I try to reason with my brain, telling it that I clearly remember doing something else and not doing what I feared I did, yet my brain keeps denying and dismissing that memory as ‘made-up’ or ‘from another time’. I interrogate myself and ask questions about the details of the feared event/action - and I can’t confirm any details (because obviously it can’t have happened, but my brain still thinks it could’ve and that I’m somehow ‘repressing the truth’). \n\nActing on the compulsion would mean accepting the absurd - accepting that I’d somehow gone against character and done the thing that I was actively making sure I never did (plus felt nausea at the thought of doing it and especially the consequences of it), and tried to cover it all up but somehow now I’m worrying “what if I’d done it and covered it all up” instead of being certain (and when I try to tell my brain this, it tries to create mental images and ‘memories’ where that becomes ‘true’). I take pictures and videos to prove where I am, and then my brain targets time gaps between pictures and asks “what if you did it between these times?”. \n\nThis cycle of doubting reality could affect a person philosophically too. Because what is reality if you can’t confirm it? Is reality then just whatever is in your head?\n\n——— \n\nI’ll get this off my chest here just for some relief (this is long and I don’t expect anyone to read it):\n\nMy fear is about what if I’d gone into a tech store, used a demo pc, made a new email and discord account, logged into discord, posted something that goes completely against my character (posted my personal details and face picture etc and said “I’ll forever only like B etc and want to be remembered for this” when I actually hate/don’t like B at all and instead like A), left it on screen, and that people are going to take a photo of that post, spread it on the internet, and someone with cctv footage access could also post cctv footage of me using the device (and possibly capture the screen too) and ‘prove’ that I wrote it. Then since it’s on the internet it could be preserved and somehow all my other social media posts can’t be found and so people in the future will think of me being someone who strongly liked B (when I actually hated B, but how would they know) and my identity and existence forever becomes misrepresented all because I ‘sounded genuine’ and posted all that (if I did). I can’t bear with the idea of being misrepresented in history, especially in such a way that goes against my core thoughts/emotions, and I’d rather not be remembered at all. \n\nI even used gpt as my therapist, and one of the things that it said that I’d been relying on to soothe myself is that if the worst case happened, future historians won’t be using such absolutist claims as hard evidence of my likings etc, and the fact that likings can change even if someone claims they’ll never like anything else etc. Plus if such a post existed and OTHER people posted about it, then it’s no longer a primary source. I’ve been praying that the discord server where it could’ve bee posted in gets deleted sometime in the future so that if the post exists then the primary source is gone (plus the server is toxic anyways and I’ve been trying to get it banned but all it got was a warning despite repeated offences). I even went through the member list and saw no user profiles that I recognised, but my brain goes “what if there’s a glitch” or “what if I left the server but on another tab and it didn’t update on the screen and so what if the post exists and is stuck on the screen”. No matter how hard I try to reason, my brain coms up with what ifs and tries to convince me that they’re ‘true’. Everytime I go outside and see what I like my brain goes “but what if you posted that you like something else and now that’s forever part of your identity”, and the thoughts give me intense nausea. \n\nI’ve gone into the store a few times and checked the screens, videoed the screens themselves (had to be sneaky because if they find out I’m videoing they could kick me out (even though my intention isn’t to film others, it’s to film the screens) and that’ll exacerbate my anxiety/OCD 100x if I can’t collect my evidence properly), and found nothing on the screens nor the search history, nor any logged in discord accounts, yet everytime I do it I come back and then I find some other time-gap to worry about. I’ve gotten to a point where I use Strava to record my movements and if I even pause it (say if I’m at the gym with my PT) and then record again then my brain goes “what if you paused PT then went to the store and posted/did all that and then came back to your PT all in that 4 mins gap”. I used to use being with my PT or “it’s a PT day today so I was at the gym for this section of time” as evidence to dismiss any thoughts of whether I went into the store etc at a certain time but now I find myself not even being able to use that reasoning and instead looking at time gaps in my Strava recording and/or pics and wondering what if it was done then. It’s gotten to a point where my brain is trying to make me believe I did all that in 4 mins and somehow kept worrying/collecting evidence of myself at the gym after that and somehow my PT not reacting/talking about how unusual it is for me to leave the session and leave the gym and the come back (and somehow my gym entry timestamps don’t show the time of this supposed ‘re-entry’). I tell myself I obviously didn’t do it, and that I was obviously with my PT and in the gym at the entire time, and even grab my memories of me with my PT that day and try to prove I didn’t go into the store at that time interval, yet my brain continues to escalate these worries. \n\nMy brain goes “what if that post exists and is up now on the screen of one of those devices and many people are gonna see it”, and that thought nauseates me. I started taking ashwagandha yesterday and I’m seeing a little bit of a reduction in that nausea. And writing here has brought me a little relief even though I know many won’t even read up to here, but that worry is still there, and the compulsions/urges still attack me. It nudges me with “just a little checking won’t hurt, just go back into the store again and check quickly and that way if you posted and it’s on the screens then you can remove it and prevent more people from seeing it and otherwise you can accept that nothing happened and you’ll be okay”. \n\nI used to dismiss these compulsions as “it’s making me check all the devices in store and I’m not gonna do that because if I really did it I would’ve known what type of device or what laptop I did it on” but now my brain is telling me “check this one device” and is giving me mental images of leaving the laptop and running back to gym as ‘proof’ that I paused PT and did it and came back (which is just absurd and instead what I do have a vivid memory of is asking my PT for a quick bathroom break (the bathroom is in the gym) and then running a few steps back to my PT and asking if I took too long, and him smiling and saying no he’d never turn down a bathroom break). However I know that if I check that one device and see nothing I’m just gonna ask “what if it was this other device instead” and I’m gonna end up checking all the devices again, possibly further raising suspicions of the staff in the store who might’ve seen me come in a few times for the past few days and go through all the laptops and even phones and tablets quickly for some reason. \n\nHad to get ts off my chest but if you made it this far I salute you lol.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "OCD", "text": "Hey I went through this during this time last year (I was 24) . It was really uncomfortable and also mind blowing. Everyday I’d connect the dots and realize my ocd is making me do something that I’ve been doing for as long as I can remember. Like the way I pick out my clothes for the day. It’s wild and I found myself wanting to tell everyone bc I couldn’t believe it. It really felt like my eyes had been opened. I suddenly had a whole new perspective on my life. It’s a weird thing to experience, and I completely understand how you feel. \n\nThe good thing is, this is the first step towards taking control of your life :) when you realize you have a compulsion, you’re now equipped to intentionally not engage. And over time, through practicing non enhancement, you will literally change your brain chemistry and your ocd will loosen its grip on you. Try to think of this stage of your life as liberation. You have the opportunity to change your life (treatment did truly change mine). The path you’re on is exactly where you’re supposed to be. \n\nNon engagement responses (NERs) were so hard for me at first but eventually it got easier and easier to let the thoughts pass. It is often automatic for me now! It will be difficult and straining and it will feel like it’s just not working and, if you’re like me, you’ll feel frustrated and hopeless. The most important thing tho, is to continue trying the NERs even if they don’t work. It will feel pointless. It took me about two weeks before they started feeling effective. I was so excited. My whole life turned around. \n\nonce you get into the habit resisting your compulsions, it feels soooo good. You’ll start to feel more in control, which is life changing. And you’re gonna continue to understand yourself more and more and that is so important for getting better.

Before this I was in remission for \\~9 months. For context my OCD is pretty much just intrusive thoughts, with the compulsion mainly being rumination.\n\nWhen I got back home I became super depressed, I pretty much just laid in bed for two months without eating very much. My doctor reinstated the Lexapro at 10mg and had me bump it up to 20mg a month later. I‘ve been on a therapeutic dose of Lexapro for 14 weeks now and on the 20mg for 10 weeks. My doctor told me 20mg is the highest dose after a e-consult with a psychiatrist and if this doesn’t work I’ll have to try something else.\n\nWell, it doesn’t really feel like it’s working. People say I seem quite a bit better but I think that’s cause a couple of months ago I decided I was going to keep participating in life despite feeling terrible most of the time, so I started going back to the gym and my hobbies. Inside my head it’s still complete chaos though, there’s music playing from the moment I wake up til I go to sleep. My harm obsession pops up all the time, when I’m talking to people, watching TV, going to the gym, I tell myself the constant noise is just meaningless thoughts but it’s still insanely distracting.\n\nSo at what point do I give up on the Lexapro and try something different? I also recently started back on 27mg of Ritalin er which seems to help a lot with mood but not so much the lack of focus.

I live with my mom right now (moving out in a month, thankfully), and the house is extremely messy. The kitchen is usually piled with dirty dishes and food splattered everywhere, so before I can even cook for myself I have to clean first. Washing a huge backlog of dishes + cleaning the stove can take me about an hour, and cooking anything involving multiple ingredients can take another hour. I also have chronic health issues that cause fatigue, brain fog, and executive dysfunction, which definitely slows me down.\n\nI’ve had OCD and severe anxiety my whole life (I’m autistic), though it’s waxed and waned. I wouldn’t say I’m in full-blown OCD right now like I’ve been in the past. This feels different. I don’t really have intrusive thoughts driving the slowness or obvious compulsions. It’s more like a deeply ingrained habit that developed during an extremely stressful year. I do have strong “just right” feelings, a lot of meticulousness and perfectionism, and it’s very hard to break out of once I’m in it — even though I *want* to be faster and try every time. I did ERP last fall, but my therapist and I agreed it wasn’t workable while I’m living in a constant high-stress, unsafe-feeling environment.\n\nLast night things escalated in a way that really shook me. After I finished cleaning everyone else’s mess and cooking dinner, my mom confronted me angrily and told me I’m *abusing* her and the family by taking too long in the kitchen and “depriving them of food.” This makes no sense to me — it’s a shared kitchen, I’m not preventing anyone from eating, and I’m not doing this on purpose. I’ve tried to communicate and plan around kitchen time, but no one wants to discuss it. Being slow because of mental/physical health issues feels very different from abuse, and I’m struggling with how distorted that accusation feels.\n\nI guess I’m looking for support and advice from people who understand OCD/obsessive slowness.

I don't mean consciously. Like you said, you aren't doing this intentionally.\n\nI say this because I also have issues with executive dysfunction, but I notice that it always is worse when I feel like it isn't fair that I have to do something, and I resent whoever asked me to do it. I will often procrastinate, and when I finally do it, I often find that I *mysteriously* struggle a lot more than I would otherwise.

I'm just mad, maybe even feel guilty for being mad, and am scared of confrontation.\n\nOCD can be understood (in a somewhat oversimplified way) as a very complex adaptation to an inability to fully feel feelings you consider \"bad\" or \"unsafe\". Unfortunately, while ERP really helps with severing the obsession/compulsion loops, people generally need a different type of therapy to deal with the emotional conflicts driving it. \n\nThe good news is that you move out in a month.

My last true flare up/episode (whatever you want to call it) was in April and then kind of in October (I was moving away from home for the first time and was in a panicked state so it was natural). Since then, I’ve moved out of state away from most of my family, gotten a job I love so much, and have the most amazing boyfriend anyone could ever hope for. \n\nI felt it last night, I remember thinking that it’s been a while. I’ve always been the “waiting for the other show to drop” kind of person. Like it always gets better, but it always happens again right? And vice versa. Anyway, it happened. My OCD tends to attack my relationship right now (ROCD) more than anything. The rabbit hole of what ifs and the vicious intrusive images of him cheating or liking other people (he hasn’t, he’s invested in me). Last night and this morning have been the worst part of it thus far. I feel the pit back in my chest/stomach. I remember in church growing up “trust your gut, that’s Jesus telling you somethings wrong,” but we can’t do that with OCD can we? We have the pit in our stomach and the desire to run and seek safety, to seek reassurance, to seek whatever the hell makes this feeling go away, but that’s the worst thing we can do. We have to sit in this discomfort. We have to let it run its course. \n\nI was in therapy back home for 8 years and was in the process of looking for someone who would challenge me more, but now I’m at a loss of where to start since I don’t even have her anymore. I’ve thought about trying to find some support groups, but I don’t know if that is beneficial or would make things worse? \n\nI don’t know if this is just me venting or me asking to see if I’m not alone in this, but please feel free to comment on this and tell me anything that you think might be helpful.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "OCD", "title": "i've been trying this top compulsions", "text": "Basically, I’ve been dealing with OCD thoughts that cause anxiety and compulsions for as long as I can remember, even from a very young age. Sometimes it gets really bad, and sometimes it’s more manageable.\n\nMost of my thoughts are about the future. I worry about my hobbies disappearing for one reason or another, or about not being able to do the things I love when I get older.\n\nFor example, as a child, I loved books, and I became stressed about the idea that paper might disappear someday, because I care a lot about books as physical objects. I also really love video games, and I’ve been consciously anxious about the idea of them shutting down or disappearing.\n\nThis past week, I’ve been doing compulsions all day and all night during my vacation whenever I wasn’t sleeping. I recently decided to try stopping them, and I have a psychologist appointment scheduled for next week.\n\nWhen I don’t do my compulsions, I can’t sleep. I cry a lot, and the anxiety becomes overwhelming. When I’m not crying, I feel this constant sense of unease, like I’m disconnected from my own life.\n\nIt’s not that nothing upsets me. It’s more that nothing really holds me anymore. I feel decentralized from my life, like I’m just existing without a clear purpose. If I can’t be sure that my future will be good, I start wondering what the point of being here is. It’s not suicidal thoughts, it feels older and deeper than that, and I don’t fully understand it.\n\nI feel unable to find peace while thoughts about my future or the possible loss of the things I love remain unresolved.\n\nI need to sleep on calls with other people because I can’t stand being alone. I stayed home today, but I still have to go to school, and I’ll probably end up sleeping very late because of all this.\n\nI can’t do most of my hobbies because they trigger my intrusive thoughts, and I’m trying not to perform compulsions. It’s been a little less than three days since I stopped doing them, at least the most severe ones.\n\nI also project these thoughts onto everything I see.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "OCD", "title": "My OCD is breaking my heart", "text": "My OCD has progressed to a point where I am avoiding most people in my family and I'm afraid to hug them. So afraid that I have actively refused a hug from my elderly grandfather twice. It's so painful to be this way. The amount of rituals I have to do after touching someone has gotten so exhausting that my brain has finally decided it's easier to literally reject my elderly grandfather or avoid him as much as possible than deal with the discomfort or go thru with the compulsions. That's so fucking sad. I feel like a monster. I'm ruining what might be the last of my time with him. He tries to understand and I'm pretty sure he's not taking my behaviors personally but that doesn't make it right and that doesn't mean I'm not hurting him. I struggle to even spend time with him because I can't even sit down on the couch like a normal person.\n\nThis is not who I am. I am a loving, nurturing person who likes to share and take care of people and I'm not allowed to be that person anymore. Now I'm someone who flinches when people try to touch me or get too close. This is just so opposite to how I would normally behave. I've created a reality that is too complicated to comfortably exist inside of and I'm doing it because my OCD has convinced me it's the only way to stay comfortable and safe. What an oxymoron. Staying comfortable by making my life as uncomfortable as humanly possible? I can barely even make decisions or remember things. I'm constantly thinking about if I'm doing things right or enjoying the moment correctly or trying to remember what I've touched and what is safe or what I said and if it was ok. I just want to stay in my bed all day where I can't make any mistakes.\n\nI feel like I can't undo the damage I've already done even if I start healing right now. I've already spent months acting like this and treating my family differently because of it. I've ruined memories, wasted precious time, and ruined my own life. The knowledge that I can't take that back makes it feel almost pointless to try and fix myself now. I just feel like a monster. I'm sorry for the long self pity post.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "OCD", "text": "Thank you.\nYeah, with all the OCDs I have had, it was always a different standard for me than I would have placed on others. \nMostly, I think I wouldn't care if my partner acted the same but then my mind asks itself whether I \"acted like that\" at all or if there had been more. Or if I only wouldn't think it's flirty because I know that I myself am worse so I'm not allowed to care.\nIt's all new to me, I went through many different compulsions over the years before being able to identify them as such but I am trying to find a therapist at the moment", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767802040.0, "id": "ny7y0tz", "author": "Kaelis_Pallion"}
