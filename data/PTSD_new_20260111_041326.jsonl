If I said no he would just start touching himself right next to me when we were hanging out...\n\nAnd so it created this shame spiral in me.

It's this mixture of rejection, while at the same time unconsentual sexual involvement, and overall I just feel gross, and I have no idea how to get myself out of this state. \n\nI made a post about this the other day, but I'm guessing it was too long, so I tried to condense it.\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way from rejection, especially sexual rejection?

Lets start off by saying I am medicated and have been diagnosed with Anxiety, PTSD and Depression.  \n\n  \nMoving on, my dad is abusive, he talks to me like shit and our house is a pig sty.  My dad was doing this thing last year (when I was 23) where he would force me to have a bedtime.  The \"rule\" was I cant come out of my room after 11PM and all lights must be off at 11PM.  If I did and it took longer than for me to piss, he would rush out of his room in the middle of the night to yell asking me what I was doing with the light on.  Fast forward to now, I'm being stonewalled, ignored and alienated from my family and friends daily.                                           \n\n  \nWhen I look up what DV and coercive control entail, I see all the things my dad is doing.  He tries to intimidate me in the dark or late at night.  He has recently locked some of my belongings in a room in our house and will not let me access them.  I am rarely a second thought to him in this house, he doesn't even speak to me outside of yelling at me or threatening me.\n\n  \nSeveral times in the past my dad would physically assault me a child.  He has not since Ive been an adult however he has done everything but and constantly threatens to kick me out and reminds me constantly about how he has guns he could potentially injure or harm with.  Of course I can leave and I have a job and have been saving immensely.  \n\nI just don't know what to do, what he locked in that room was my workout equipment.  Now I basically have nothing to take care of myself.  When I asked if he could open the door he exclaimed \"No, if you weren't smart enough to get your stuff I don't know what to tell you next time it'll be your room\".  I am just so beyond mind blown I cant even think it into words.  How can he withhold things from me that I paid for that I need?  Me living in all of this and not being able to work out is really bothering me.\n\nMy mom recently had a life altering surgery that has changed her life so I had a hard last year of still taking care of my aging mom while my dad terrorizes both of us.  This is just such a hard spot to be in, the economy is terrible the cost of everything is up and I have nothing.  I rarely see my friends because I don't live in a walkable area and I cant ask my dad for anything without him trying to manipulate me or sabotage my plans.  \n\nI literally hate my life, I go to work and someone asks me how my week was, I don't even remember due to all the nonsense and trauma my dad causes daily.  It brings me great anxiety to even speak to my dad, there were plenty of periods where I would stay in my room and not eat because I couldn't bare the thought of being in the same vicinity as him.  I dont even like calling him my dad, if I was in trouble I wouldn't even call him.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768012520.0, "id": "1q8s6w2", "author": "Realistic_Moose_3318", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q8s6w2/my_dad_is_stonewalling_me_and_withholding_my/"}

I’ve tried to find other places to talk about this but I don’t have insurance right now and this is the only forum that has discussion like this. \n\nOkay, so I’ve tried to just stay away from the person and even moved several times and across the country and he will show up everywhere I live and even showed up at my work and house and other places in a suburb across the country and then followed me back, too. \n\nI don’t know anything about him but he seems to always know a lot about me. He has repeatedly humiliated me in public and has never apologized for any of the hurt he has caused. I’ve had a really traumatic childhood and then even more traumatic adulthood and he seems to take advantage of my issues with trauma so that if I ever speak up about it he can just remind everyone how crazy I am. \n\nI’ve tried to write it off as paranoia myself but it just doesn’t make sense for someone to follow you across the country and back. A name I didn’t recognize from someone I’ve never met sent me $20 through my bank too and then requested it back and won’t explain who they are or why they sent me money or how they got my information. I also, with dealing with this for three years, have gotten to the point of using humor to cope. So, I would tell my therapist or my sister about things in a joking way thinking okay I guess it’s not an issue but then they think it’s really alarming. I just get so tired of having to pretend like what he’s doing is normal. And he does this thing where he acts like he’s going to finally leave me alone just to start something up again and get me upset. Like he enjoys upsetting me. \n\nNormally people would like acknowledge like a funny situation like oh I ran into you that’s so crazy haha or like why they accidentally sent you money or something but he doesn’t. He just does things all on his terms and then doesn’t ever explain or apologize for anything and then just makes people think I’m crazy for being upset. We never even talk and I’ve never given him any of my information but he always knows things and then won’t explain anything. \n\nI’m also just dealing with things you know going on with the US government and being scared and idk I just think I don’t need this and idk why he needs to do this. I’m so tired of my life having to be how am I going to deal with this person all the time now. I don’t get why he is doing this or how he doesn’t think it’s insulting. I don’t get how my worth is so low like I can’t even get an explanation and should have someone pushing me around and basically trying to breadcrumb me instead of explaining what they want. I just want like safety and normal genuine people in my life. I feel like I have no agency or say over my life sometimes and it makes me so suicidal.

He didn’t. She admitted to me herself “the sex was good, i enjoyed it” and even mentioned to numerous people how he was impotent the entire time. She even got law enforcement involved and my entire personal circle turned on me, ghosted me. I assume it’s because the narrative is that I was defending a rapist. \n\nI don’t know how to go on knowing she is just free to live her life, covering her tracks with lies. I have reason to believe this is not her first victim because she has personally accounted how in a previous relationship she was in her ex would “just try to get it over with” when she wanted to have sex with him. \n\nShe goes to NYU. Her family is not doing poorly. I fear she will live her life unscathed by karma and even successfully despite what she did. \n\nI know it did not personally happen to me, but the entire event scarred me so badly. I still, with guilt, cannot look at asian women (which she is) without feeling a deep disgust within me. Like a constant reminder of what happened.

It brought me straight back to when my partner died of leukemia/lymphoma 5 years ago and horrid childhood fears and memories of growing up \n\nwith a sexual predator. \n\n Mike died Nov.2nd 2025 and I went into a clinical depression and high episodes of PTSD, panic attacks, crazy deep crying jags, 3 hours of sleep a night and lost 22lbs. Got meds, going to 12 step meetings 1-3 x a day as I can manage (39 meetings in 16 days. A lot online.)\n\nI have people around me now to uplift me and help me know what next to do. Unemployed. No steady job. Today I was exhausted, sleepless and overwhelmed. I’m on disability for Major Depressive Disorder but it feels more like PTSD or BOTH. Where do I get a diagnosis and also a treatment plan? \n\nI have a wonderful spiritual counselor and am eating again but still sad and overwhelmed at times.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "My Story (and PTSD EFFECTS)", "text": "I've posted my story before, then deleted it out of fear.. but i want to post it again\n\nThere's a lot.\n\nTw: Physical Abuse, Emotional abuse, verbal abuse, sexual assault, grooming, manipulation, stalking, domestic abuse, threats, kidnapping, suicide, animal abuse, neglect \n\n\n\n\nI was born into a house of domestic abuse. My dad was severely abusive towards my family, especially my mom. From what I've been told, he would gaslight her, acream scream scream - and hold in her choke holds and shake her. Hold her by the hair and shake her violently. He would chase her with a car, with my twin and I in the car, threatening to run her over and kill her.\n\nOne day, he swung her around jn a choke hold, and nearly killed her. He caused permant damage, so that was the day we all left, for our safety. I wish that was the end of my story - but that's just the beginning. My dad wasn't about to let us go that easily .\n\nSo, he began to stalk and follow my mom everywhere. At her job, at places she went too- hed find her. He made countless Facebook accounts to keep messaging her, threatening her, etc. Eventually this was brought to court - for custody wise, for my sister and I\n\nThis went on for months. During this time, my mom would let us visit him sometimes at restaurants, or schools. But, with this, came rhe kidnapping attempts. He trapped my sister and I in a trunk and tried to drive away-  but other people stood infront of the car to stop this. This happened many times, until he wasn't allowed to see us until the court thingies were decided \n\nThis made him so much angrier. He went to my mom's job one day and tracked her down and screamed at her, threatened her and said she stole us from him. The police had to escort him out abd he didnt get charged for anything. They said it was his mental health \n\nHe made hundreds of drawings of my mom hung in a tree and him holding hands with my twin and I, the three of us smiling. He wanted her dead. He wanted to kidnap us. We were in danger.\n\nThis is when my mom met my stepdad and she often left us home alone with my older sister (half sis but I just call her sister(, and brother, my older sister only being around 16 - when there was a man the loose wanting my mom dead, probably willing to have my older sister and brother dead, and my twin and I kidnapped.\n\nThis became a regular, and my older sister had to step in to raise us, pretty much. When my stepdad started to come over, she still had to raise us, and do a lot of stuff my mom should've done, not her. \n\nThe court decided- my dad would get my twin and I, unsupervised, every weekend. My dad's family all took his side, either not wanting to step in, or blantly saying my mom was a liar.\n\nThis is when that abuse and control started for my sister and I, for the next few years. My mom abd stepdad got married, and my older sister moved out at 18. \n\nShe often had to watch us, so my mom and stepdad could have sex, so she was still forced to raise us, as my mom slowly faded into the background. And, according to my sister, my mom, grew mean too. She would yell, she forced my twin to pick up spilled glass with her bare hands, she threw our toys all around once.  And she was working 3rd shift so we barely saw her.\n\n... that's when my stepdad started to give me attention. And gifts!!! Dad was hurting me, mom barely saw me- so I clung onto the love I DID get. This went on, until one day, he raped me. He told me not to tell anyone, so.. I didnt \n\nI dreamed off the assault for months after. Wet the bed. Knew stuff I shouldn't. Found stuff I shouldn't. And I never told a soul, until I eventually repressed it. \n\nMy dads abuse grew worse. He would hold uo by our necks, lift us up by our hair and shake us and drop us and hit us. He would call us slurs, call us cry baby's, call us a million terribke words, that I cannot name them all. He would hit our dog, mango, to scare us. \n\nHe would threaten to break up with his girlfriend (who he also abused, and who we also adored(, when we argued, so we'd stop. He would take away our food and ket us starve, if we whined. He would lock me in dark rooms, if I was \"bad\", he would threaten to kill himself. He threatened that God would kill him. He threatened me i would burn in hell forever if I didnt apologize for everything. For every single mistake\n\nHe would call me weak.\n\n\nAfter after moment of abuse, he'd isolate himself and cry. I followed him, and.. let him vent. He said he was a terrible dad that deserved to die, and that he'd go to hell, and that he should die. \n\n...I knew his mental health was bad.\n\nI always comforted him and begged him to pray, even as I was in pain, even if my throat was sore from crying and screaming and wailing. I still wanted to //help//\n\nHe died, 2019. Allergies \n\nI stayed  with just my mom and stepdad after this. My stepdad grew emotionally abusive, often insulting my body, my worth, everything. Slowly, this abuse made my repressed memories of the assault come back... and also the grooming.\n\nDuring the emotional abuse, where he would be belittled me, my worth, my body, where he'd accuse me of lying and yell at lot, a part of me started to crave that kindness I once had, even if it WAS grooming, because it was still love.\n\n My mom changed, too...she got more neglectful for me. She would always bring my sister and stepdad to the doctor, but never me. I was always overreacting, just had anxiety, etc - even the time I was sick for weeks, to the point I nearly collapsed. \n\nShe laughed at me when I begged her to stop smoking by me because I was getting bullied for it and my breathing was getting bad. She screamed at me whenever I had anxiety attacks infront of her, and even went as far to \"agree\" with my anxiety which made it worse\n\nWhen I cried, she yelled. When I made a mistake, she called me slurs and terrible words. Eventually, my twin and I tried to move to my sister's for a week for our health, and when my mom found out she gaslight me asking what we did wrong, asking why we hate her, etc\n\nThis became her habit. She says stuff like \"I hope you remember this when you're older\", \"youre lucky im not abusive\", \"kids would be happy to have your life,\" \"you don't have trauma\" and stuff like this. It was getting.. overbearing \n\n\nMy stepdad turned nice again. He gave me attention, gifts, money, books important to him and played songs about sex while driving me to school, and I.. grew attached, again. A kind within the storm.\n\nOctober 6th, 2024... it all got too be too much. So... I attempted. I got scared after and went to the hospital with my mom... and she made it about herself. \n\nShe joked with the doctors. Told them she told me to get therapy and I had refused ahd laughed and said \"SHE IS NOW!!!\" (she never told me to get therapy, lol), she told me I'm lucky to have her because she had nothing. She used it as an excuse to reinforce that \"your stepdad loves you\" (she has excused his emotional abuse), she even took the heart reading thing on my finger to show the doctors her heartbeat. They didnt stop her. They laughed, too... she also forced me to say no when they asked if I was abused at home. And she made it seem like it was my older sisters fault. \n\nShe was angry the way home. Yup... \n\nI attempted 5 more times after that, now all silent because of how my suicide attempt was treated.\n\nThen, I found out the truth of my dad, that my mom hid from my twin and I. My dad killed himself. Since then, I haven't been able to rid of the guilt, since he relied and vented to me, showed signs and I didnt do anything, and he died.\n\nI got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, anxiety, depression and I forgot the others.\n\nMy moms neglect grew worse. She and my twin argue a lot, and I hate it. She uses me for her vent source. I hate it.\n\nMy stepdad stopped the kindness Eventually, he's just.. content now. Casual. My mom has made it clear i can't go to her about the sexaul assault because she has chosen him over the emotional abuse, over when he attacked my brother, over when he was transphobic to his kid,  when he made sexual jokes to his kid and that family cut him off. She told me if i ever get groomed, she'd be so mad and angry with me.\n\nSo, she isn't a safe space. I told my therapist tho, since I'm 18 she can't report. \n\n\nI still live with my step-dad, and recently this has triggered my trauma every single day. I have daily panic attacks, I'm always on edge, sometimes I'm shaking, I struggle to eat, I can barely sleep, I'm scared, anxious, I disassociate for hours every day, I'm scared of it happening again, I have flashbacks every day, I remember how it felt and tasted, every day, I have to curl up in a ball to protect myself from the memories. Its.. difficult \n\n\nSo that's my story - and that doesn't include all the bullying, friend abandonment, lies, online manipulation, the amount of people who used me for their own benefit online, the ex online friend who threatened to kill me and harass me for months, the many times ive been in dangerous situations, when I got set on fire, when I almost drowned, the car accident, etc- all of that\n\nI'm tired. I'm barely making it through senior year I'm so so tired.  Ive been abused and used by so many people, especially my caretakers. I'm always on edge now, I have nightmares, a lot of my memories and childhood are just gone. \n\nIm jumpy, I'm scared of relationships, I'm an overthinker. I have therapy, and though it has helped to vent, it won't ever fully heal the pain ", "score": 4, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767945836.0, "id": "1q82i3w", "author": "DawnZoid", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q82i3w/my_story_and_ptsd_effects/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Help me create a self-treatment plan", "text": "I'll make this as short as I can, thank you in advance for reading. \n\nI was raised in a very chaotic, abusive and neglectful household by a single parent who loved me but had serious psychiatric issues and wasn't able to care for me much. Sometimes even the food wasn't safe to eat. I was molested a lot by different people and don't remember all of it. Alot of my family were also immigrants, trauma survivors of a totalitarian regime they were lucky to survive and eventually escape. This haunted our family. My family was also mixed-race, because my father was Black. Some of my family was racist. And my mom didn't understand or know how to help me cope with racist behavior and images I faced at school, in media, etc... I also was bullied at school and had a lot of stress about that. \n\nNow I'm in my 40s, chronically stressed, obese, persistent depression, and various health issues doctors don't understand and dismiss, and on antidepressants which help a little. I don't take mind altering substance (alcohol, canabis other drugs etc...) but I do periodically binge on caffeine. Even as a kid I was hypervigilant. I would get adults to tie me up with skipping rope to practice getting free if I were ever kidnapped (because I'd see people getting kidnapped in TV shows).\n\nI spend my days plagued by fears of harassment and persecution for being Black, and taking in the trauma of the past and how it affects me and other Black people today, both African and diaspora.  I also think about climate change a lot and collapse because of how politically unstable the world is. In short, I think we are truly fucked in a lot of ways. It's not just the environment, is politics and financial collapse, etc... Not just Black people, but people in general. It all scares and upsets me. It upsets me as a woman too, and I'm glad I'm reaching an age where most men won't want to bother raping me when there are younger women and girls around, but I still worry for them.\n\nI've read \"The Body Keeps The Score\" and it was helpful up to a point.  People say you need to be Part of the problem is that my trauma is about hypervigilance and worry. Another part is that no one is ever completely \"safe,\" and the darker your skin is and the more you are a woman, the less safe you usually are. \n\nMy health cannot handle this. I need to become resilient. I need to work on treating my trauma and overcoming my hypervigilance and fear. I need to do this while being resilient to the fact that while threats are not the highest for me personally in this time and place, they still exist. I have some things that help a little: repeatedly hearing about why my trauma is normal, understanding and being reminded that I am not alone and that my story and experience and fears and threats I face are not unique, and that there is some solidarity in that. \n\nBut I need more. I need to be able to somehow cement that hope and peace I get from feelings of solidarity from a momentary to a permanent thing. I think I need to also find something to *believe in.* Something *more* important and valuable than just hiding from or fearing whatever horrors my foremothers and forefathers faced or whatever risks exist today or in a potential future. I need to shift out of the mindset of hypervigilence and running mental scenarios of either how to \"win\" a situation where I'm facing oppression, marginalizing and threat, or fearing the worst and faced with nothing but doom. This can't be based on \"people will think of green techno solutions\" because I don't believe in that and even if it existed I don't know if we'd use it or if it would arrive fast enough. \n\nI also meditate 20 minutes a day. I'm open to EMDR but not a therapist because I don't feel I really need to spend money on that. I've spent money on a variety of therapists and I don't mostly feel they help. The fear is I'll retraumatize myself but I just don't feel professional EMDR or IFS therapists are the answer. I paid a man $160 to do a tapping session with me and I feel I had an emotional reaction that I could have had on my own without paying $160. Mostly tapping doesn't work for my anyway. \n\nI'm open to suggestions.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767937023.0, "id": "1q7zykj", "author": "Dependent_Unit_3271", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q7zykj/help_me_create_a_selftreatment_plan/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Thats a lot of questions to answer 🙃. i say go ahead and do EMDR. it's supposed to have a certain effect against your PTSD. The primary mechanic of EMDR is exercising your eyes with a trained therapist that will guide you through the whole process. So, here's kinda what the exercise does. your eyes are connected to your brain via the 3rd cranial nerve which, along with the 7th, 9th, and 10th cranial nerves, are a part of the Para-Sympathetic Nervous System (PSNS). The PSNS's main function is to keep the rest of your brain soothed and calm. Without it, you're a nervous wreck. This is mostly what PTSD is except PTSD has an overactive amygdala involved, which when active pumps out excessive amounts of adrenalin and cortisol for heightened chances of survival. this kinda feels like you're always on 3  or 4 cups of coffee. Oh also, your PSNS is shut down because you cant be calm and rested in a life threatening situation. This is the part where people get stuck. people dont know how to restart their PSNSs after being traumatized. This is what EMDR helps with.\n\n\nWhen you do EMDR what you're essentially doing is innervating (stimulating) the 3rd cranial nerve which in turn temporarily innervates the rest of your PSNS, temporarily putting you in a calm and rested state. but again, it's only temporary. This is where you have to find ways to keep innervating your PSNS. Cool thing is there are 2 other cranial nerves that can be innervated and they do the same thing. An even cooler thing is that 3 of these 4 cranial nerves come out through your ear canal and come forward towards your face before splitting off to different parts of your body. You can essentially massage your face and almost get the same effect. this is what you want to do after successfully completing EMDR. Just keep in mind EMDR usually takes 6-12 consecutive weekly sessions to complete. Dont let any of that sway you, a calmer life awaits.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767943638.0, "id": "nyk315m", "author": "Codeseven58"}

Even hauled out the DSM and went through it with me line by line because I'm such a skeptic. And part of me is maybe considering believing it but that leads to another issue. \n\nI've always held this internal belief system that a problem stops essentially being a problem once it's identified, like having a name is akin to a solution. Knowing you have a problem negates needing help for the problem. If you're well enough to ask for help you don't need help. So like, ok, maybe I know I have PTSD. The second I claim that, then to me, I shouldn't have it anymore. Knowing what's wrong means it goes away. \n\nAnd I'm decently sure I know what contributes to this. I was never taken seriously with issues growing up. Tell my caretaker I feel like the kids on 20/20 with depression? No that's not about me. Tell her as a teenager I'm cutting? Well what's she supposed to do for that? Sick with an intimate infection? Well I can't expect an adult to go to the STORE for MEDICINE for me! Ask for accomodations in college for a congenital disability I was never allowed help for in school? \"Uh, student support services isn't *for you*, sir.\" I was always supposed to solve my own problems, take care of myself, shove aside any needs for the convenience of others. And while this isn't exactly the same thing it pings off all the same areas of my brain and I feel like it's related. So now I feel too stuck.

When I’m around people I cannot cry or show much sadness. Which I guess is a good thing. Don’t want to look like a baby. But it leads to awkward laughter when somethings sad or uncomfortable. At my uncles funeral I was crying all night the night before on my own and after the funeral I was crying too. But I was so awkward during the funeral I didn’t cry and wasn’t able to display any sadness. I even giggled at one point when they showed a video of him playing the guitar when he was younger.\n\nIt was a giggle of awww him in his youth. Which some people got and giggled with me. But some people thought it was insensitive and maybe it was. It did make me emotional seeing a young video of my uncle. But I cannot cry.\n\nThere’s been times people have said or done something that really hurt me. Like recently I tried to have a conversation like with someone I went “Hey Ben! How are you?” And he blew me off and was like “OP I don’t care to talk to you right now” which is really odd. He wasn’t busy. Wasn’t talking to anyone. And I’d just helped him out hugely by getting him on a date with my friend who’s his crush. I was really hurt but I was like “oh ok! Sorry” and did the awkward laugh thing. I felt like crying but luckily nothing would come out because of the fact I was around people. It’s not a conscious effort I physically can’t.\n\nBut I went to the toilet and almost immediately just floods of tears came out. A bit dramatic I know I’m still sort of a cry baby and I’d had a stressful day so I think this was kind of the tip of the iceberg for me that day.\n\nIt makes it awkward sometimes too with displaying sadness. If someone tells me something sad like maybe a relative passed away I have empathy and really do feel sad inside for them but I have to consciously control my face and voice to the able to performatively show sadness.\n\nEven with sex it’s completely different when I’m around the person or afterwards or on my own. When I masturbate I often cry. I guess because of the sexual trauma. It’s uncontrollable on cue just as soon as I orgasm I breakdown like 9/10 times. But when I’m with someone else and we have sex or something I do feel the sadness but cannot display it thank god cause that would be embarrassing. But once I get alone I just cry.\n\nI seem really happy and giddy in all of these examples I’m with people unless I turn it to anger or I consciously work really hard to keep my serious sad face. But even then it’s difficult to show people I’m sad. Which is a blessing and a curse I suppose.\n\nI don’t want to be known as a cry baby but I want to show an appropriate amount of sadness and empathy.\n\nAnd not it turn to anger. There’s an example. My friend told me she isn’t going to be my friend anymore. I was really sad but just seemed numb. I walked away and immediately started sobbing. She found me crying and I couldn’t continue crying anymore or being sad and it turned to anger of me telling her to fuck off and stuff.", "score": 9, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767927928.0, "id": "1q7wtpm", "author": "No-Dream9806", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q7wtpm/i_physically_cant_cry_or_show_sadness_around/"}

Establishing a bedtime 'routine' that creates an 'ideal' pre-sleep mood. For me it looks like journaling, relaxing, practicing mindfulness with the intent of getting anything negative out or at least on paper. Mentally it helps me be able to relax just to write it out and give whatever I'm ruminating on a name. If I'm still feeling racy/iffy, I'll try to lose myself in a book and fall asleep reading.\n2. Re-writing nightmares. When I have them I will try to rewrite them in a way  that they have a positive outcome before the 'traumatic' begins, of it it starts traumatic, like there is a rescue that ends happily. Or that I become a super hero or whatever fits, the idea being to keep the theme of the nightmare there, but making it positive in my mind. This is basically an attempt to let my mind learn that it can hold power over those things. \n3. EMDR Therapy specifically reduced and minimized nightmares involving the things we targeted in EMDR. (This helped me with day to day triggers/symptoms too). This type of therapy is insanely intense and probably the most mentally exhausting/difficult thing I've done, but I'm glad I did.\n\nSince you literally do not feel safe sharing a bed with him \\*today\\* I would really focus on seeing if he can talk to a psychiatrist and potentially seeing if a 'fast' pharmacological option (IE Prazosin or similar) would make sense in the short term while longer term healing is allowed to happen.", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1767902254.0, "id": "nygkui4", "author": "EmsHeart"}

I would also talk to an immigration attorney, because technically when you got your green card, you no longer need him to be a US citizen, you just have to wait 5 years instead of 3.\n\nJust because he is a vet and sacrificed himself for this country it doesn’t mean he gets to treat you like a second class person because you benefited from the marriage too. Make sure you set boundaries in that relationship before it is too late.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Distancing myself around alcohol consumption", "text": "!!TW: alcoholic drinks and consumption mentioned!!\n\nFor some context my Fiancé (M 21) and I (F 20) had just celebrated his 21st birthday last week. Before this him and I never drank, never partied, we both just simply had the same idea, wait until we’re 21. \n\nMy father, going on over 30 years now, has been a functioning alcoholic. He drives under the influence, works under the influence, even cooks / clean. But always with a beer in his hand no matter what. I’ve probably seen him sober a total of 12 times in my entire life, but the twist is, he’s never hit me, abused me, gotten angry AT ALL. He just acts drowsy, clumsy, and laughs a lot, but that’s it. He simply drinks to cope with his trauma from the service.  My fiancé’s family is completely sober, his mother will have some shots every once in a while with a friend, but I haven’t seen his dad drink ONCE. He had a great childhood as well. Mine couldn’t be any different, my childhood was shit.\n\nNow this is where I feel terrible. My fiancé’s 21st birthday was coming up, we were going to Epcot to drink around the world and all I could think about was how much he was going to drink. I panicked at the thought of him even having a sip of alcohol and I was petrified of ruining his 21st birthday. He knows about my dad and how drinking makes me feel, he reassured me he wasn’t interested in getting drunk or even drinking around every single world showcase, but I still felt nervous. \n\nOn his birthday he had half a margarita, a whisky drink, a few sips of an IPA beer (he hated it) and a Piña colada. He was tipsy, not even drunk in the slightest for a total of 30 mins and that was it. But as soon as I saw his demeanor change, I distanced myself, I zoned out and tried to relax because I didn’t wanna ruin his birthday. I tried so hard to fake my enjoyment but in reality I was absolutely heart broken that I had these feelings toward him because he’d never given me a single reason to. He’s always been so kind and patient with me, even during our engagement his mother offered to buy us wine to celebrate and he rejected it for sparkling grape juice. \n\nIt didn’t end after his birthday. He told me he was going to go get something, and left to go to the store. I saw his location bounce to a drug store, and two gas stations. I nearly sobbed because I thought he was gonna go get alcohol, he came back with a sprite, a SpongeBob Olipop for me, and defeat because he couldn’t find the ice cream he wanted. The next day he mentioned that he would like to try Labatt Blue (he’s a bills fan) and he mentioned just buying the smallest pack they had, if he hated it he would throw it away. I began feeling hot, I zoned out and my heart rate quickened. But I never mentioned to him that I felt this way. I only said “okay! I don’t care!” I can’t even imagine how suffocating it would be for him if I acted this way every single time. \n\nI am so mad at myself and exhausted with how this feels every single day now. It’s to the point where I can’t even sleep because I’m up with the thoughts “what if he likes this certain alcohol so much he drinks it all the time?” Or “what if he starts hiding it from me because I’m not making it a comfortable topic?” And the worst part is I can’t even go to therapy for it yet because I can’t afford it. My university provides 6-8 free sessions of therapy but my semester doesn’t start for another week. I’m so annoyed because for my whole life it never bothered me to see my mother have a glass of wine or my brother have a beer. But it’s completely different with my fiancé. I feel so alone because everyone else I’ve read has a reason to be afraid, they’ve been abused or worse by family members due to alcohol consumption, and I’ve never even been close to it by my father. My dad’s ex (old step mother) drank and was shit to me but she never hit me or anything like that and I haven’t seen her since I was 10. \n\nAny thoughts or coping mechanisms to use until I get into therapy sessions? I wanna work this out for myself before him and I get married, it’s so unfair to him and I love him too much to put him through this.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767878564.0, "id": "1q7bnsp", "author": "Ambitious_Art_1633", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q7bnsp/distancing_myself_around_alcohol_consumption/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "I've heard bad things about UK mental healthcare.  It sounds similar to how it is here in the US.   Here they don't even know what PTSD is and aren't able to diagnose people properly.  That sounds crazy but it's actually true for PTSD.  They think PTSD is a catch-all and hand the diagnosis out like candy.  It's very convenient for them, they don't have to think.  The practitioners who are capable are really hard to find.  Or they're busy doing research.  I don't know about other severe mental illnesses, it could be similar too.  I had to try to get referrals to a doctor who actually understands PTSD, and ended up seeing someone in a different country over zoom.\n\nIf you're having psychosis and they're saying it's PTSD it's possible they could be misdiagnosing.  PTSD can look like schizophrenia.  But the things that are seen/heard/etc are around the shock trauma for PTSD.  I don't think it would be Jesus talking to you, for PTSD it's the associated event that happened (violence, unexpected death, natural disasters, serious accidents etc).\n\nI was exposed to fundamentalist religion as a child and developed fear of hell.  It's a really difficult thing, I'm sorry you're going through it.  Eventually I worked out that it would be immoral to send people to hell just because they don't believe the 'right' religion.  There's hundreds of religions, so the odds of you having the \"true\" one are very low.  So I stopped believing it despite the danger of going to hell.  I told that 'god' I would rather go to hell that be with a god that condemns people for not believing in Christianity.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767885397.0, "id": "nyesqb4", "author": "throwaway449555"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Schizophrenia is actually my biggest fear and one of the evaluations I had was by the schizophrenia team where they had three paths 1) discharge without medication and/or diagnoses as not schizophrenic. 2) place on ‘potentially schizophrenic’ pathway aiming to reduce the risk of developing it, 3) schizophrenic pathway which is basically diagnosis and treatment. \n\nI practically begged to be put in the second pathway because schizophrenia runs in my family VERY heavily and very severely including my mother who’s been ill since she was 17 and no medication has ever truly helped her. Despite having 5 family members with treatment resistant schizophrenia, including my mother, they insist it’s PTSD and wouldn’t place me on the second path, putting me on path 1, therefore discharging me with delusions, auditory hallucinations, grandiose beliefs etc all of which I explained. The problem is they all believe schizophrenics can’t be self aware.  As someone who grew up seeing this illness including my mother have a severe relapse when I was 12 which caused us to be homeless, you can be acutely aware at certain stages. They won’t believe it’s schizophrenic because of my age and the fact it started after trauma. But so did my mums, and my uncles, and my cousins, and my nans…\n\nI’m now struggling daily with intense delusions and desire multiple attempts to get help, a complaint, and a second opinion, I’m still unmediated and untreated and now drinking heavily daily to cope (yes, I’m acutely aware it won’t help. I can’t manage the sheer terror otherwise). \n\nI’ll die from this. I swear it. Because the services meant to help me wouldn’t.\n\nThe irony is I feel myself getting more and more paranoid every day and less and less trusting of mental health services. I can’t tell, genuinely, if that’s due to further trauma of not being believed so often by them, or because I’m developing the same schizophrenic paranoia as my mother has. In desperate to believe it’s PTSD but even if it is, I’m not being helped and I can’t manage the daily abject terror I’m dealing with.

Sometimes, people get failed by society but no one ever believes the victim and eventually the victim gets tired and stops explaining only to make themselves look like a liar. \n\nI have records that prove my story but I can’t post without doxxing myself. Sometimes I’ve been so angry I’ve fully outed who I am, including name, address, mental health services etc just excuse I’m so desperate to be believed. Just once. Only to realise that was a mistake and delete it all, further making me, ironically, look like a liar to everyone who saw my posts after I’d deleted them. It’s like you can’t win as a victim.\n\nFeel bad for yourself? ‘Stop being selfish’ \n\nHate the abuse you took? ‘Wow, spoilt much? \n\nHate your abusers? ‘But they’re your parents/maybe you deserved it’\n\nActed out in fear/retaliation/mental illness they caused? ‘She’s an abuser. Look! See! I told you!’ \n\nEverything about abuse paints the victim as the bad person and the abuser as the good and the thing is, the boundaries ARENT clear. Abusers can do good things, be highly sensitive people, not mean to hurt others, while victims can be mean, hurt abusers intentionally, and not have the empathy they’re told they should for the people who hurt them.\n\nAnd these things are EXCEPTIONALLY easy to misunderstand both as an outsider AND an insider. Sometimes the abuser genuinely thinks they’re a victim and vice versa. It makes being the true victim unbearably hard because when you can’t tell if you deserved your abuse or not, if you abused them or were reacting out of trauma, if the person you abused was really an abuser or just another victim that their abusers have painted as an abuser to confuse you… when you truly can’t tell black from white, how do you ever recover?  Especially when you can understand that your own abusers were, in fact, abused and are victims in their own right, beholden to their own trauma. \n\nIt’s not a black and white line and I struggle with guilt every single bastard god forsaken day.\n\nThe line between ‘abuser’ and ‘victim’ isn’t always as clear as society portrays. In fact, sometimes it’s impossible to tell. Remember that one story you heard in the paper one time, and felt enraged that a victim didn’t recieve justice? That’s what I mean. If you knew the full story on both sides, you’d know it’s not always clear and sometimes victims become abusers and abusers become victims. It’s rarely black and white which makes it so much harder for all involved to understand their role and placement in what happened to them. It’s why so many victims struggle with shame, guilt, and self blame. But unlike what society, the internet, and the media want you to think, abusers aren’t emotionless, soulless robots. They feel guilt. They feel empathy. Sometimes they change for a bit and become better. Sometimes victims change and become worse people. \n\nMy point is, abuse can be so insidious it’s impossible to know victim from abuser. And maybe we can’t tell because there is no boundary.

I felt safe there. Now that I’m back in a large public school, I feel like I relive it constantly. Every door slam, every book dropping, every alarm and siren. I can’t do anything, I just panic and freeze. My counselor is advising I step out of the engineering program due to my grades, and told me that it’s okay, because they’ve never had a student with a mental illness like PTSD even make it this far.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "A combination of various therapies and medications may be needed for some of us. I know it can be exceptionally frustrating to keep working through it when youre already so exhausted, but please dont give up on yourself. Better is out there. \n\n\nI went through years of different types of therapy when I was resistant to trying medication, and then had to try multiple medications before I found a combination to help me, and some medication helps mitigate the side effects from others. \n\n\nWhat ended up being most helpful for me was a combination of medication and ketamine therapy. MDMA therapy is a passion of mine to learn about and I believe is truly the future of therapy for PTSD specifically, but it is not available in many areas yet. If you are able to do that, especially in conjunction with talk therapy, the statistics on it for PTSD are ASTOUNDING, even extremely long term treatment resistant PTSD. If you haven't already, I deeply encourage you to watch How to Change Your Mind docu, especially the episode about MDMA and psylocibin. I feel very hopeful and glad for you to be able to try that and I think you will have positive results! Know that trying these types of therapies too, some patients have great responses immediately after the first session, and some other brains benefit more from multiple ones. \n\n\nA combination of an SSRI, a very small dose of an NDRI, and an exceptionally small dose of an atypical antipsychotic ended up being my treatment, while also doing IM ketamine therapy. (Large doses, full disassociative trips, not daily). If an SSRI previously helped you as well, but had side effects, maybe you could consider trying a medication in conjunction to mitigate the side effects or may have better luck trying another brand of SSRI or an SNRI. \n\n\nAnyways as I started improving, I was able to reduce the frequency of my ketamine treatments and the amount of medication I was taking. I also did talk therapy during or after ketamine sessions, which I found immensely helpful, and some EMDR on occasion, as well as slow and steady, controlled exposure to triggers. The science behind ketamine and neural pathway growth is incredible, similar to the growth established after psylocibin mushroom trips (which is also an incredible medicine for many people with access). \n\n\nFor some people, therapy is enough. For others, western medicine. Some others, natural medicine. For many of us though, I truly believe we fall somewhere in the middle of all of those categories at times in our life. And I know it can seem like SO much to have to constantly mitigate side effects, work starting and stopping medication, combining medication and adjusting to THAT, it is all a LOT of work, dont let anyone tell you otherwise. Especially when youre already struggling to care for yourself. \n\n\nBut I cant stress enough - make sure you have a therapist and/or doctor that is RIGHT for you (if you do already, ignore me!). That doesnt blindly prescribe you medication - that is very educated in responding to the sensitivities of your specific body and mind, that works with you. \n\n\nSometimes it can take a while, it can be a long and exhausting battle - but there is SO much therapy and medicine out there, different things work for different people. It took me many years!  But when you find the fitting combination- God the way your quality of life improves makes it all so worth it. \n\n\nBe easy on yourself, and think of it this way - if your neurological system is overwhelmed and constantly in fight or flight, its not going to be able to ease into and respond to other practices (especially body and mind connection ones) until your nervous system can be at rest. Finding the right medication combination to bring that rest to your body makes a lot of those other exercises possible with time. 🧡\n\n\nWith time I was able to start and follow through with a lot of practices I was unable to do prior - and I became less and less reactive to things that normally would startle me or make me feel anxious. \n\n\nGood luck my friend 🧡  Truly. ", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767887338.0, "id": "nyeztee", "author": "AriAlba0113"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Hi and thanks for your reply. I know it's easy to read that, that's why I said it. It's not that she's not there and I need her. I lived away from her years and years, in a different country. All to leave my family behind. It's the fact that she knows my pain and my struggles and has rejected me without letting me explain myself. It's the most frustrating and surreal experience. She was the one speaking to me night and day, mostly, she would say good morning and good night. She's the one who made it so daily and present in every moment. I just took it as her being extra warm with me. She thanked me for becoming who she is today, that she wouldn't have done it without me.\n\nAnd we're not islands. We depend on each other much more than we believe. Having a net where to fall on is literally a basic human need to thrive. But it is the rejection from someone who knows about my history of rejection that is traumatic. As I said I asked for help with therapists and they don't reply.\n\nI don't mean to reject your viewpoint, but I know it's easy to take that reading. It's not the point. I don't need her, I just can't overcome that she of all people rejected me and manipulated the truth of it. I hope I made myself clear.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "This may not speak to you the way that it did for me… But it’s worth a shot? “Sometimes people are only in your life for a window of time.” (I don’t remember where I heard it, but it has given me a lot of peace and comfort over my years.) You have been through a lot, and you absolutely have my sympathies. I hope that you can begin to feel better soon. The friend that you are so disappointed in, is walking on their own sidewalk and it has diverged from yours, in a way that you’re not comfortable with. You have no choice other than to accept it. Grieve for it, be angry about it and then accept it. It also sounds like you’re at a very low place and all the advice you’re going to get here is going to sound trite,  and possibly uncaring to you. Perhaps it’s time to get mad. Mad feels way better than sad… take that anger and utilize it for something that benefits yourself! I can’t speak for everyone, but I’ve been pretty low in my life and anger has always saved me… Put on some running shoes and go for a walk. Go to the library check out some books. Don’t get self-help books….get books about UFOs or Bigfoot or romance novels, tech, science or whatever the heck you may be interested in. Listen to some really bad ass music. I listened to a lot of Tool when I was angry. Take small steps to start taking care of yourself,  because obviously you’re walking on your own sidewalk as well. If your aforementioned friend is not gonna be there for you, then you have to be there for yourself. Being horribly sad and depressed is a slow race to the bottom. (I’ve definitely been there myself.) Being angry about injustices that have been done to you is yet another way to get to the bottom….and it is unhelpful. Square your shoulders and get better… Even if it’s out of spite, initially. Do the smallest things to take care of yourself. Put on some music and clean the shit out of your bathroom. Move on to the laundry. Get down on your hands and your fucking knees and wear yourself out. Do your own toes and your own manicure and exfoliate your face. Clean your car. And you may have help around you that you’re just not seeing right now, because you’re so angry with someone that you used to rely on so much. Of you don’t have family, you may have a next-door neighbor who could use some help from you? All good. Just look. Go online and learn how to make soup. Maybe there’s an elderly neighbor that needs a little bit of help somewhere near you? Maybe you have a family member who’s also suffering, but you haven’t seen it because you’re lost in your own woes. Get your butt out there, and make NEW connections. Because it sounds like you’re gonna need them! And you earn those new connections by reaching out. All of life is not this hard, but you should try. The more you try, the more things fall the way they’re supposed to… It’s kind of like Tetris. You get better at it! Put both of your feet on your own sidewalk and begin. Stop thinking about your pal that you’re so disappointed in, and start thinking about your own mind and your own heart. You are more resilient than you think that you are. I’m sending some good vibes your way. ❤️", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767848430.0, "id": "nyceq3u", "author": "herbeauxchats"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "I thank you very much for your reply, I know you mean well, but I've always been like this when I was dealing with very difficult stuff at home. Yes, my friend helped make me feel understood, but life was already unbearable and I've always been very positive and done all kinds of stuff. I actually love being by myself and doing things solo. It is because I've always loved doing stuff that she thanks me for helping here because she's quite negative about people and I think she knows it's because of her family, who behaves like a cult, trying to keep her away from people. I hate that from all this painful text I had to write people get I'm some dependent clingy person, and they couldn't be more wrong. I even got dislikes for talking about interdependence and the importance of having at least someone in my life. Even when I mentioned I may be autistic, in which case it would make even more sense to need help. To be honest, it hurts to get these judgements after all the shit I've been through completely alone for years and years and the effort I made writing that text. Now I feel stupid. Having her didn't make the problems disappear, it was just having someone at least. So it's not that I can't accept she's walking her way. I'd be okay with that if it made sense. It is that it breaks my heart in the worst way to not understand such change of behaviour. It is unfair. I don't hear anything about how unfair that is. Only some kind of condescending judgement where I'm just some clingy toxic person. I've been through a lot and I've been completely alone for years. And still I made her life better because I love helping people feel better, I'm funny, I enjoy things with passion. I feel stupid and humiliated by that kind of judgement. I don't see comprehension, I only see the easy judgment of making me feel as if I'm not going enough for myself. That's even ableism, isn't it?\n\nSo again, I know you come from the best intentions and I thank you. But I'm not in a place where I can get past this. And still, I walk, I try to keep myself busy but nothing works, it is surreal. Because it's not that we grew apart, it's that she intentionally left me behind for no reason after years of being like sisters to each other. How is it fair that I get to hear the stiff she said when they were lies? How can people still prefer to let me know how much of a weirdo I'm being and not have empathy for the stuff I've had to hear from someone I've loved so much and that it's so crazy? Cause it's fucked up. I don't see the empathy for that. The \"shit, why would she say that to you.\" How is it okay to hear that I'm not functional as an insult? When someone you care about is hurt, you don't help by humiliating, you help by accompanying. Sorry for this message. I'm so hurt. I just hope you understand how I feel. You're very kind but all that kind of stuff I've done for years to keep me going. This time, it's not working. It's also crazy to be this alone. To spend Christmas completely alone. It's sweet what you suggest, but it won't work. It's funny, that was her advice once, to hate someone so you can move on. I don't work that way, I can't. I need the truth, I need honesty, I deserve an honest explanation and not accusations of me leaving her. It's so unfair to hear that. I made a fool of myself sharing all this stuff. I've opened my heart and got judged for it. This is the kind of stuff we complained about together. This is why I don't understand. There's no closure.\n\nThanks again, I hope you can understand what I mean. Oh and as I said all my family is fucked up and has hurt me in every way possible. No, there's no one I can or want to help, and I can't get near them or they'll hurt me again. It took a lot of courage to leave them behind. They let other people hurt me, too. It was so painful. I don't have a car, but I'm nice to neighbours. It's flats, not houses. I do the laundry and skincare and everything because I have to, but I can't go on with life, I'm broken and can't find where to go. I'm just a ghost. I'm just surviving. Thanks again, you were lovely, but it's just too much I've had to endure and I'm in  shock and in pain. Nothing means anything, apparently. So much sharing values, analysing what's wrong in this world, in this society, what's selfish and in self-interest... For nothing. Sorry. Really. And thank you again.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Should I see a specialist?", "text": "I'm (16f) 5 months out of an abusive relationship and I'm still struggling with some mental issues and I'm wondering if it might mean I have ptsd.\nIf you don't wanna read the details of the relationship and what happened that I think might have caused it skip the first 4 paragraphs sorry for the long post. \n\n\n My ex (16m) was abusive in a lot of ways, he'd often hit me for doing something he didn't want me to or reacting in a way that he didn't like to something, as well as using physical abuse to control me trying to talk about the abuse in our relationship and I specifically remember when he'd kick my legs from under me, grab me around my ribs with his one arm to hold me still and put his other hand over my mouth to stop me from speaking when I would try and tell someone about how he treated me. We shared a lot of friends and we're still young so he'd often play it off as a joke or something not serious and people would seem a little awkward but wouldn't say anything about it.\n\n He was also really emotionally abusive and always made me feel like I was ruining his life, accusing me of never changing and trying to hurt him when I didn't know what I was doing wrong. We had a lot of arguments and I truly do feel like I did love him so the arguments really hurt emotionally and put me in a severe depression, especially nearer to the end of our relationship where I'd spend all day thinking about how I could try and stop the emotional pain I was feeling by getting through to him because I knew he was the only person who could make the pain stop.\n\n He cheated on me twice, and after the first time I was so shocked and hurt by it I chose to forgive him purely because I couldn't mentally process the pain I felt because of how he cheated (his ex had asked to get back together and he'd accepted over text while on a video call with me, telling her we'd been friends for 5 years and I'd helped him through the hardest times in his life when I'd only known him for 3 months when she questioned seeing him around with me) the second time was later in our relationship when I had begun to process the mistrust and hurt of the first time he cheated, and it completely shattered me. I broke up with him a couple weeks after that, after I had questioned him because I didn't believe he was grounded and he called me pathetic for mistrusting him even though he cheated on me less than a month before. The emotional pain he put me in was bad, but I'm still not sure if i was maybe just over reacting, but I tried taking my life twice because of our fights and I often would be left crying for hours because of how hurt i felt. \n\nHe was also sexually abusive, and it was only after the relationship that I started to realize this and it's what's having the biggest impact on my life right now and why I'm questioning if I need to see someone about my issues. He was the first person I ever slept with, and he pressured me into sleeping with him for his birthday because he kept talking sexually about his ex to me and telling me the only thing he wanted from me for his birthday was for me to sleep with him. He said it as a joke, but whenever I spoke about his birthday he'd repeat the same thing or ask what i was planning to do with him. When I spoke to him about him cheating with his ex, which was 2 days before his birthday, I asked if he was sure he wanted to be with me instead of her, and he told me he did because I was better in every way other than the fact we didn't do anything sexual together. I did give in, and the first time we slept together I wasn't on any kind of birth control and I hadn't told my parents about it before hand, and after the fact I realized this was probably because I didn't want to do it in the first place which is what made it feel wrong. We were both of age and my mom would have been okay with it as long as we were safe, as she'd had many conversations like this before with us to make sure we didn't feel awkward talking to her about it. The entire time it happened, I felt like I was watching myself from a 3rd person perspective, which I didn't see as unusual at the time, but now I realize I was probably disassociating from the situation because I didn't want to do this. The only protection we had was an out of date condom, and he forced me to let him take it off half way through saying I was wasting his time because it didn't feel good enough. Throughout the course of our relationship there were many incidents similar to this and we never had sex without me feeling like i was having an out of body experience, as well as him pressuring me and sometimes forcing me into doing sexual things with him. We were in the same math class, sat next to each other and I remember him putting his leg between mine and prying them open to touch me in the middle of class while I struggled. \n\nFor those who didn't wanna read all of that (I don't blame you) to summarize my ex was sexually abusive and manipulative, as well as violent toward me when I tried to make people aware of the abuse as well as being emotionally abusive and manipulative, and I developed a trauma bond with him before I broke up with him.\n\n We've been separated for 5 months now, and he's been stalking me on social media as well as trying to get information about me from friends. He's also had some violent behavior toward me since we've been separated such as trying to push me down the stairs at our college, and he's on a final warning with the college for his behavior toward me.\n\n I try my best to not involve myself with him at all, but any time he's even within eyeline of me I feel really scared like I'm in fight or flight. I also have problems with anything sexual, if someone talks about my sex life with him or anything that reminds me of our sexual relationship I start feeling like I'm in the 3rd person again, and my friends have noticed this and expressed their concerns for me because of how I act any time something like that is mentioned. I also have panic attacks that leave me crying and having to repeat to myself that I'm not there with him any more and that he can't hurt me when I sometimes see something that specifically reminds me of his abuse, like someone putting their hand over my mouth or telling me that I need to \"get a grip\" which was something he often said when I tried expressing my emotional pain to him. Any time he's around I'm left shaken and feeling panicked for a while after. Is this normal or should I see someone?

I contacted the suicide hotline a few days ago after nearly deciding for the last time that my life wasn’t worth living. That’s where the story begins.\n\nA few days ago: I was really, really heartbroken. I was reeling from my PTSD and obviously depression, so before I did anything like attempting, I contacted the suicide hotline (988), and maybe an hour after talking to them, they sent the cops to my house. The cops would bang on my door, screaming, \"POLICE, OPEN THE DOOR, OR WE'RE GONNA KICK IT IN,\" so my sister obviously decided to open the door, and they told her everything about what I messaged them which was honestly heartbreaking. They dragged me out of the room “metaphorically” (not really, lol), and they asked, “Were you going to attempt? right in front of my mom I denied it at first because I didn’t want my mom to hear how much I was struggling, but then they said, “We are going to take you to get the help you need.” They took me out, put me in the back of an ambulance, and started talking. Now I was still denying it because I mean, I knew I was going to be thrown into the mental ward. We got to the hospital, and then it got even worse.\n\nAt the hospital, they assigned me a screener who literally took my heart and stomped on it. We just talked for a little while, and then that’s when she said what I fear most: “YOU are NOT normal” and never will be, so I started to think they are right 100%. I’m not normal, and I never will be. I told her about my life, and she told me her life and basically said hers was worse, and if she could be positive, I needed to. Then we kept talking, and eventually we got into a little argument after she told my mom the things I never wanted her to hear.\n\nAftermath: I am no longer human. My family now treats me as if I’m insane. I have no friends, and my medications make me feel heartbroken; they make me realize I’ll never be normal. I’ll never even just have depression. I’ll always be the guy who has PTSD, OCD, anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder. I don’t know what to do or how to live. I mean, I just turned 18, and I feel like a quarterback who’s just been drafted to a really bad team.

Now, i developed this response of looking away, not breathing, spitting, breating out etc. to kind of cleanse myself off the presence of somethihng that directly relates to that school, but the thing with this is that those advertisements are absolutely all over the city because this school in question is a private school with dozens of different campuses and they also get money like raining.

Trigger Warning!", "text": "TW: \n\nI have a few examples.\nWhen I was 18 my boyfriend’s dad who was an older and rather scary man would occasionally grope or slap my ass, or show me pornographic images and ask if it made me “feel nice”. He once told me multiple times to sit on his motorbike even raising his voice at me and then told me to adjust myself on it or once I think he told me to rev it and while doing it he asked if it felt good on my p**sy. \nI remember laughing this off. I knew it made me feel uncomfortable. But I didn’t know what else to do. I think for some odd reason I was completely unaware that this was creepy, plus I wanted to like the man. \n\nYears later I went camping with some of my now-ex partner’s (different person) friends who I didn’t know well. Some of them were couples. I was 23 or so. While camping I can’t even remember what exactly led to this but I’m sure alcohol was involved. And we ended up kissing our partners, which was consensual.\nBut at some point someone suggested that they should eat someone out and somehow I was the chosen one. And I vividly remember resisting, saying no repeatedly, asking them to pick someone else, and then ended up with my shorts off, one person each on one of my arms and legs, while someone else began to do various acts to me down there. And they were at least 2 or 3 turns by different people and I remember feeling horrified, extremely anxious, paranoid, but unwilling or unable to fight because I didn’t want to be a party pooper so I remember faking an orgasm to get it to stop and then spending the rest of the trip in a corner of my tent feeling nauseous and upset. During it everyone seemed to be having a nice time, and no one seemed to notice I was uncomfortable. \nBut until recently, I never considered that this could be Sexual assault. Whenever I remember it I would always feel sick, humiliated and uncomfortable. But it doesn’t affect me other than that.\n\nI think I just make excuses for it. Like that we were mostly girls, one guy and also one trans woman (male genitals still though) so therefore it wasn’t real SA, or that I should have known what I was getting into when I was playfully kissing people and that maybe I asked for it, or that we didn’t know any better cuz we were drunk. \n\nBut I do wonder what’s wrong with me that I didn’t realise something was wrong when it was happening. Like it should never be normal for your boyfriend’s dad to try to arouse you in multiple ways…! Why didn’t I think about it like that back then? Did I subconsciously enjoy it?

(Also sorry for the long rant)\n\nI dont really know what i should do... i always felt kinda broken. Was stuck in therapy when i was 9 for a year and a half because i stoped talking, had day dreams and couldnt see the diffrence between dream and reality.\n\nThen i moved away, quit therapy was thrown out there to deal with it. And now as a young adult as a trainee i feel suddenly off.. \nThe  years in school till 3 ago years i didnt talk to anyone unless i felt comfortable around them. \n\nNow i try to force myself out of it. And keep having people say my body language is off, that my mimik and tone doesnt fit my emotions sometimes. Sometimes people touch me to make me comfortable but i sometimes just flinch into myself for no reason. When I just go out to go to work on the way to the trainstation random memories come up and anxiety rises up. \nSometimes even home.\nI have the habit of talking to myself in my head like im talking to somone else.. it sometimes tiggers memories that overwhelm and stresses me out.. \n\nSometimes days start that bad for no reason that I feel like everything is blurry. That im not full there, feel like im locked in a dark room in my mind and watch myself doing my tasks. That even if I screamed no tone would come out. Sometimes I even though 'what if I stabed myself? Would I even feel it?'.. \nThat state lasts always around hours to even a full day..\n\nBut what I also noticed is that the tone and how people talk to me affects me quite a lot..\nLike just criticism that I made a mistake and that what I'm doing is really wrong makes it hard to not cry... its like a wave that I can try to die down but with big waves even suicidal thoughts come up. \n\nIt's slowing so overwhelming that I just want to quit and stay at home.. isolate myself and just how my mind wants not to talk to people. \n\nBut I just try to push though.. every issue even if my heart beats out of my chest like crazy.. when I get scolded at work so bad that I want to fall down the stairs with a glass vase. \n\nThe worse part is I can't even ask for help.. when I get asked by anyone how im feeling while not triggered I'm fine, so say I'm fine... \n\nWelp it's been more messed up some years ago.\nBut it's since I remember it's never been fully normal... kinda annoying that I know even with how much work I put into it. That im never going to be able live in full peace... not having people bother me why im so silent and that as an young Adult now that I have to have it all together now..\n \nHuh.. funny how parents say your too young to have issues as an teenagers just to tell you once your old enough that you should have it together.

Very normal.\n\nExcept he has nightmares multiple times a night and sometimes during his afternoon nap (he is 7 now so he gets a little tired sometimes).\n\nHe sleeps most of the time in my mom’s bed and he will whimper, cry, and yelp in his sleep. We were told his previous owners kept him outside 24/7, but that’s all we know about his past. He is also very easily startled (can relate) by the cat and will bark/growl at her to get her away from him.\n\nI mostly worry about the nightmares and I hate that there isn’t anything I can do about it. I think about all those dogs that went through those studies to discover how mammals react to repeated trauma. I wonder if they had nightmares like my Panda Bear.\n\nHe is sweet and you would never know that he has nightmares every single night. When we hear crying or yelping, we gently pet him and talk to him in a soothing voice and it stops. Sometimes he wakes up, but most of the time he stays asleep.\n\nI’m not sure if this is the right place to post this, but idk another group who would relate more. Not really looking for advice, just wanting to share about my pup.

At that age, I started to become afraid of my own heartbeat and for some reason all these years later, it has come back with a vengeance. \n\nI had to admit myself into an Intensive Out Patient program and after graduating from the program, using all the skills in my toolbox for the symptoms, meditating/breathing exercises each day, etc. I’m still in this slightly agoraphobic and panic riddled state. I need serious help because I refuse to allow myself to remain stuck like this. \n\nI started looking into brain spotting and EMDR therapy, as well as TMS treatments for anxiety. It seems like EMDR is my best bet but what do you guys think would help? I think I may need a clinician to do some type of desensitization therapy with me. \n\nThank you for your feedback and time. It’s one day at a time and we are in control of our thoughts and emotions! We are going to make it through these difficult times and we are not alone. You are worth it.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767745356.0, "id": "1q605ee", "author": "Oldmanwaffle", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q605ee/im_having_trauma_related_panic_symptoms/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "People deliberately triggering you once they know triggers", "text": "Ok I've pretty much had PTSD over one specific event for about 20 years, however I also have CPTSD due to family/upbringing.\n\nThe most recent job I had, I had been working for the same employer for about 25 years. And it was fine for about 20 (usual ups and downs). Then a new manager arrived and he was very strange compared to every other manager I'd had both at that firm and anywhere else. He demanded that his way was the only way. Expected everyone to sit still for 8 hours in total silence, with no collaboration - this was in an engineering office where there had been collaboration both within that department and others.\n\nTW start\n\nOk then reason for my PTSD was a SA. As a result I do not like anyone standing behind me, and behind to my right. Nor do I like anything touching my right forearm. These correlate directly to what happened.\n\nTW end\n\nNow this manager harassed me a lot, though would ask me for help way too many times (which I never got any credit for). Now in some naive hope that he would understand and avoid those places, I had told him I had PTSD and not to stand closely behind me or touch my arm. What then followed, until I left months later (after an awful lot worse behaviour), possibly not daily, but several times a week he would (the chairs were on wheels) either a) fling himself across the floor and slam into the side of me, then stay absurdly close, and then put his arm next to mine that it was touching all along it's length, and if I moved he moved with it. The physical closeness was also touching. I felt absolute revulsion (because he was gross anyway); b) he would slowly wheel over, whilst I was deeply concentrating and he would perch his head on my right shoulder, and be so close it was well beyond personal space and deep within intimate space. I don't joke about this. I couldn't even turn my head around because he was so close.\n\nBoth of these should have been sackable offences due to sexual harassment but the HR just backed up everything he said. He had lied a few years ago prior to that, and either the HR was utterly useless at her job, he had something on her, or she believed him like a devoted follower. I can assure you I had done nothing except exist as a team leader (tipped to go into management (not that I wanted to) prior to his arrival).\n\nAs a result I was such a nervous wreck etc, that I only realised months later that the period was very much like coercive control, and that I can't recognise the person I was (I believe OSDD-2 may have happened as a result). But yes I do have dissociative amnesia with regard to stuff, but it comes and goes, which further gives potential to a proper dissociative disorder. I put up with that guys behaviour for about 5 years, including having a stroke because of the stress (I came out of that relatively well due to my physical fitness at the time (pretty much peak)).\n\nWhat is everyone else's experience of someone not only triggering you, but someone who goes out of their way to do it frequently, over a long period of time, again like the original trauma, where you can't escape (I had bought a house 2 years prior to his arrival and so was paying the mortgage alone, and so couldn't just quickly leave).\n\nI continue to be scared of encountering another person like him in a job.\n\nSorry I didn't know quite what flair to put this under.\n\nI'm male btw, as is that manager.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767713179.0, "id": "1q5lke7", "author": "Some_Description4422", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q5lke7/people_deliberately_triggering_you_once_they_know/"}

I did not notice I was doing it but I stopped when asked.I think in that case I was moving my hand in a repetitive motion. &lt; this was probably an unconscious self soothing thing. At some point I was given one last ECT, this one official as opposed to the ones being done outside the knowledge of the official records to inflict brain damage and make me forget and sound unreliable, just days before being sent to foster care. Apparently the twitches stopped after that. They destroyed my vocabulary and ability to find and use the correct words.\n\nThe twitches of my head and neck began again, though I did not make the connection at that time, when I was being put through hell after a surgeon screwed up my life on a work injury. Then about 8 years later I ran into the scum who gaslit and otherwise mentally and emotionally abused me in pretty much the same ways I was as a kid in the Shelter. Including the medical people who lied and abused me just because they could. Anyway after that, I forget how long as the memories came back slowly over time, I eventually made the connection between what was probably a psychological reaction to the torture and abuse and my inability to get relief or justice of any kind as a kid to what was happening as an adult. \n\nI had it really bad for years when it came back, then it relaxed.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "After 2 years of severe asthma and Adrenal Insufficiency, my body is stuck in \"survival mode.\" Looking for advice from those who have overcome somatic trauma.", "text": "I’m sharing my story in hopes of getting some guidance or perspective from anyone who has gone through something similar and managed to move forward.\n\n**The Background** It started two years ago. I moved to a city I loved for an incredible job. Within a week, my lifelong asthma became severe and uncontrollable. After four months of extreme respiratory distress and a hospitalization (where I caught COVID and the flu on top of everything), I had to quit my job and leave the city. I was devastated; I stayed as long as I could because I didn’t want to go back to my mother’s house. During those months, I developed intense pain in my intercostal muscles and all my accessory respiratory muscles (neck, traps, ribs).\n\nSurprisingly, once I moved back and my breathing stabilized, the pain and the sensation of shortness of breath (dyspnea) stayed.\n\n**The Medical Crisis** On top of that, I developed **Corticosteroid-Induced Adrenal Insufficiency**. My body stopped producing cortisol. Some might think \"no cortisol = no stress,\" but it’s the opposite. Without cortisol, you can’t handle *any* stress. You feel like you’re going to faint, you have no strength, and even basic sensory input feels overwhelming. Two years later, I’m still recovering. I have enough cortisol for daily life, but not for stress (work, intense exercise, strong emotions, or illness).\n\n**The Somatic Connection** For a long time, the shortness of breath drove me crazy. My tests are now excellent and my asthma is controlled, but my body still *acts* like it can’t breathe. I recently realized this is a muscular/nervous system issue, not a lung issue.\n\nI’ve seen dozens of doctors and specialists. Early on, I lost 2kg a month until I hit 45kg. I was told I might have cancer, which destroyed my mental health. After a 3-week hospitalization, they finally found the Adrenal Insufficiency. However, regarding my chronic pain and dyspnea, most doctors treated me like a \"ghost\"—they couldn't explain it and eventually dismissed it as psychological.\n\n**What I’m Feeling Now** A respiratory physical therapist finally explained that my body is stuck: my diaphragm is constantly tight, my obliques hinder exhalation, and my neck muscles (scalenes) are always \"on.\" It’s a somatic problem. My mind wants to go back to my old life, but my body is stuck in the trauma of those four months when I couldn't breathe.\n\n**What I’ve Tried:**\n\n* **Physical Therapy:** Myofascial release and Vagus Nerve induction work, but the relief only lasts a few hours.\n* **Lifestyle:** Gym, yoga, and rehab. They help, but they don't \"cure\" the underlying tension.\n* **Therapy:** I’m seeing a Gestalt therapist with experience in trauma. We work on \"body presence,\" but I haven't seen major changes yet.\n* **Medication:** I’ve been on 5mg of Diazepam for two years (my psychiatrist sees it as a \"lesser evil\" for now). I’m considering SSRIs in the future.\n\n**The Mental Struggle** I feel a huge conflict. I loved the city that \"destroyed\" my life. I feel stuck while everyone else moves on. I have this overwhelming craving to feel **safe** again—safe in my own body.\n\nTo make matters harder, I live with my mother who has Fibromyalgia. She is in constant pain, and hearing her daily struggle makes me terrified that I will end up like her, trapped in a cycle of chronic pain.\n\nI’ve read *The Body Keeps the Score* and I’m looking into more resources on trauma and the nervous system.\n\n**Has anyone here dealt with severe somatic symptoms after a medical crisis? How did you teach your nervous system that the danger is over?**\n\nI would love to hear any success stories or advice.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Hi there, \n\nMy condolences for the trials you are overcoming in life right now. That sounds super difficult, but I must echo some other folks: \nYou have incredible insight (especially for your age) and you are actively seeking help. \nThese strengths will go a long way in getting you through this. \n\nIn similar mental health crises, what helped most (for me, personally) was DBT crisis interventions. \n\nThere are dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) intensive outpatient programs (IOP) in America that typically include group and individual therapy, the course runs over more than a month and requires quite a hefty time commitment. IMO, it is a better alternative to being hospitalized, especially if you aren't meeting the criteria for inpatient hospitalization.\n\nThese and similar programs help individuals learn and practice emotional regulation, interpersonal skills, crisis management, and more. The goal is to empower clients to take back control of their thoughts and emotions. The wait list for these programs vary, but I am unsure what availibility is like in Canada. I am lucky that I have a friend who did the whole program years ago. He was able to stop SH (cutting) and although he still has a lot of SI, he has ways to manage his negative thoughts and keep things from getting really bad.\n\nDuring a time when I was struggling with severe depression, panic attacks, SI, and desire to SH, he calmly walked me through the cold shock intervention for crisis management - I was skeptical, but it really helped! I can't really submerge my face in water, but if you drench a hand towel in ice cold water (don't wring it out!), then place it on your face for several minutes, the cold will be really cold - and it gives your brain the wake-up it needs! there is a lot of interesting rationale behind why this works. For me, I placed the cold cloth below the temples and just over my face, NOT my forehead, otherwise it gave me a terrible headache, so you can make adjustments to fit your needs. During this exercise, focus on taking slow deep breaths.  Inhale. exhale. steady. slow. -- Take a short break and repeat a few times. Sometimes, if I am feeling lazy, I will just sit in a cold shower, but it never really gets cold enough to give the same effect.\n\nMore on the \"why\" it works:\n\nMaster Emotional Control with TIP the Temperature DBT Skill | Counseling Center Group https://share.google/MQoMDD75AUroUuCU3\n\nThe DBT workbook my friend used:\n\ndbt_skills_training_handouts_and_worksheets_-_linehan_marsha_srg_.pdf https://share.google/T9N95ygoWznzpOlFb\n\nI am not sure if this works, but you can actually find the whole DBT workbook online (I think). It is pure gold. It may seem intimidating at over 400 pages, but don't worry about finishing the whole thing or even doing it in order. Just find something you think might help and use the handouts to guide your therapy. You can find excellent self-help therapy resources online, if you know where to look. Sometimes it is cool to do these lessons with a support person too, like friend or family. I made a goal of at least reading one page a day.\n\n\nI hope this helps! There are resources everywhere if you just know what to look for. You got this!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767738233.0, "id": "ny3anqs", "author": "Suitable-Middle9599"}

I’m just here to give you my very similar story, which ended up turning out just fine so hopefully it will help in some way. \n\nI saw your post a couple days ago on this subreddit, and you mentioned this all started with shrooms in 8th grade. When I did shrooms it triggered some sort of anxiety disorder. I spent weeks after visibly shaking, sweating 24/7, everything looked weird and hi-def. I was so scared of everything and certain I was losing my mind, and when I tried to get mental health help I was told it would be a month wait until I could get an appt. I didn’t think I could make it that long, but I did! And the help helped lol. \n\nThe fact that you can recognize something is wrong and are seeking help is a good thing - it sounds to me like the shrooms triggered some serious anxiety and derealization but neither of those are psychosis or anything close to it. I was also convinced I was developing psychosis at first, but the message I kept hearing from professionals was “if you’re worried you’re going crazy, it means you’re not going crazy.” And eventually I came to trust that. It’s been 4 yrs since my shrooms experience, I never did go insane and with the help of talk therapy and some life changes the anxiety and derealization have improved drastically. The weird perceptual differences faded over time too.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "PTSD + nighttime fear after medical trauma completely changed my sleep — looking for input from others with similar experiences", "text": "I’m looking for insight from people who understand trauma-related sleep issues, especially fear that’s tied specifically to nighttime.\n\nBefore this started, my sleep was normal. Even with depression and anxiety, I didn’t have these problems. The latest I would go to bed was around 11 pm, and the latest I would wake up was around 9 am.\n\nJust over three years ago, I had a serious infection. While trying to fall asleep during that time, I experienced extremely vivid hallucinations. They weren’t just visual — they felt physical. I was convinced I was being attacked, thrown, hurt. I could feel it happening, and I truly believed I was in danger while lying in bed.\n\nThat experience completely changed how my brain associates nighttime and going to sleep.\n\nAfter the infection, I developed severe fear at night. Going to bed didn’t feel safe. I remember sitting on the couch late at night knowing I needed to sleep, but feeling like I could not go into the bedroom. It felt dangerous. So I stayed awake until the fear dropped enough that I could tolerate sleep. That pattern never fully went away.\n\nWhat feels important to clarify is this:\n\n\t•\tI do not fear sleep itself\n\n\t•\tI fear going to sleep at night\n\n\t•\tI can take naps during the day without fear and without needing stimulation\n\n\t•\tI can sleep when external stimulation is completely removed (for example, when I was hospitalized and had no phone or TV — my sleep schedule corrected fairly quickly, even though anxiety was still present)\n\nBecause of this, I don’t believe this is typical insomnia.\n\nAt night, I rely on my phone or TV — not because I want to scroll or be entertained, but because it reduces the fear. It helps calm my nervous system and keeps me grounded. The phone is not the problem; the fear is. When the fear is high, I don’t care what time it is — the only goal is to feel safe enough for the fear to subside.\n\nI’ve tried all the standard advice:\n\n\t•\tEarlier bedtime routines\n\n\t•\tNo phone / no TV\n\n\t•\tMoving stimulation earlier\n\n\t•\tStrict rules\n\n\t•\tWhite noise, silence, darkness\n\nNone of this works long-term, because it doesn’t address the fear itself.\n\nI don’t like living this way, and I genuinely want to change it. I’m not avoiding sleep — I’m trying to avoid re-experiencing terror.\n\nRight now, I’m considering leaving my phone outside the bedroom and using something like a basic e-reader (no apps, no browsing) so I can still have low-level stimulation without falling into endless scrolling.\n\nI’m posting because I’m looking for input from people who’ve dealt with trauma-based nighttime fear, PTSD-related sleep disruption, or similar experiences.\n\nIf you’ve experienced:\n\n\t•\tfear that’s specific to nighttime or going to bed\n\n\t•\tneeding stimulation to feel safe\n\n\t•\tsleep changes after medical trauma or hallucinations\n\nWhat actually helped over time?\n\nWhat didn’t?\n\nDid your sleep ever return to something that felt normal?\n\nI’m open to different perspectives — I just ask that responses go beyond basic sleep hygiene advice, because I’ve already tried that extensively.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 10, "created_utc": 1767655151.0, "id": "1q51ldw", "author": "NoState5369", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q51ldw/ptsd_nighttime_fear_after_medical_trauma/"}

[EDIT TO ADD] Since this is /PTSD, I focused on depression because two go hand-in-hand but the symptoms overlap enough that it can mean something going untreated. EX: being medicated for anxiety but not depression.

I live in a third-world country and belong to a lower-middle-class family. We have a house and one motorcycle that my father uses for work, so I don’t have personal transportation and rely on public transport to go anywhere.\n\nSince childhood, I have always been socially awkward. In kindergarten and elementary school, I never had any friends at all. At least back then, I still had my parents. But after my second sibling was born, and then the other, I felt completely ignored. I was never included in family trips because we were very poor, and only my younger siblings were taken. Because of this, I slowly developed feelings of jealousy and resentment toward society.\n\nWhen I entered middle school, I was bullied for being too quiet and was even physically hit by a classmate. When I told my parents, their reaction was the opposite of what I hoped for. Instead of comforting me, they scolded me and told me to introspect, even though I was bullied simply for being quiet, which happened because they rarely talked to me at home. At that time, all I needed was to be accompanied and maybe receive a little warmth from my parents.\n\nI never joined school trips in middle or high school because I was aware of our financial situation. I was never taught basic life skills, my parents always said that school would teach me everything. I didn’t even know that brushing teeth was an obligation, and now I have already lost three teeth at a relatively young age.\n\nThey often mocked me whenever I tried to do something, which destroyed my confidence and made me hate myself. Yet when they talk to extended family, they describe me as “insecure,” without realizing that they are the reason I became this way.\n\nI am now in my early twenties, unemployed, with no skills at all.

Along with it there can be many possible major comorbid disorders such as depression and anxiety, but PTSD specifically is about shock trauma around an event or series of events, for example unexpected death or violence, combat, natural disasters, serious accidents, etc.  Occasionally someone who experiences those things can develop PTSD.   C-PTSD is something completely different too, it's a rare and more severe PTSD, not attachment disorder as believed by therapists in the US.\n\nIn my experience, PTSD aligns with the ICD-11 description of re-experiencing the event as if it's happening again in the present, being very afraid of everything/everyone (hyperarousal), jumping at noises and being startled very easily.  \n\n[https://icd.who.int/browse/2025-01/mms/en#2070699808](https://icd.who.int/browse/2025-01/mms/en#2070699808)", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767623153.0, "id": "nxtkxhs", "author": "throwaway449555"}

You should talk to the people who care about you and let them know that you do want to be there but struggle with it. You can ask them how you can be there for them. People who love you will understand. You don’t have to be perfect, sometimes conflict happens and things can be worked through, sometimes not. Friendships and being around people who love you is hard. But talk to them, show up in small ways, in ways you can. Explaining where your behavior comes from is not self centered. Let yourself be loved and love in return. Engage with them, hang out, consider their needs, ask about things if you need to. This shit can be rough, it can be hard, but it’s worth it. With the right people it won’t feel like rocket science. Your efforts matter, I think the mindset you have now is good, I really wish you the best. Sometimes connections are uncomfortable, and we have to go through that discomfort. \n\nMy advice is truly is to try and open up, if you ever feel overwhelmed you can tell someone that sometimes it might take you a while to answer a message, or that you don’t want to hang out that day, but don’t be avoidant. You have needs, but so do they, good friendships mean people look for each other. Sometimes that intimacy can feel rough, and being vulnerable is hard. I wish you the best in this, I’m sorry you’re going through this. Sending all the best", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767578857.0, "id": "nxqqd8r", "author": "robins_birdarang"}

These aren't some drug street gangs they're simply a bunch of bored 12 to 18 year old bastards who clique up in numbers between 15 to 25 and start going to different neighbourhoods looking for fights, sometimes they'd find another clique like them and start engaging with them in rock and machete fights often times blocking traffic in busy streets because a hail of rocks is raining from the sky, cars get broken and innocent passers get hit and some end up dying, but at least that's a case of a group against another, the problem is what happens when they don't find a group and instead find one or two guys within their age range or look young, it's brutal, constant stories of guys being slashed and cut, they stoned a 16 year old boy within an inch of his life just because they felt like it, no prior incident to settle no score, no prior grudge, just because. \nI personally got pressed a few times while being sent to run errands or on my way to school and only god saved me, others however did not, my own cousin who is my age was walking home from school and got jumped by 14 teenagers who walked up to him and asked him where he was from, once he said his neighbourhood they began viciously attacking him with sticks and rocks and one of them kept aiming for his neck with a machete but he kept guarding his neck and face, a nearby crowd rushed to help and the bastards fled.\nNow law enforcement is actually pretty good at catching criminals, but it is not good at preventing crime, they're not afraid of the police whatsoever and i can't confirm for sure but i heard the police are lenient towards minors but I'm not sure.\nOne incident that absolutely solidified my fear happened 2 years ago, my little brother was in middle school and at 7pm it was time for him to leave, but as soon as he stepped outside a group of masked up teens with machetes began randomly attacking students, my brother ran for his life being chased by one of them with a machete and was traumatized severely after that, all because they decided that today we don't like this neighbourhood so we'll attack it, my dad decided to send my brother to school the next morning like nothing happened and told me to go get him when school ends, i almost shat my heart out, i seriously began shaking, he was having none of it though he told me to go regardless, so i grabbed a machete and hid it in my clothes and went there, i knew if a police patrol passed by and decided to search me at random I'm cooked, but I had to get him out of there, thankfully the police was already surrounding the school and nothing happened and i brought him back safely, but the fear i felt throughout almost made me pass out.\nAll of this made me extremely anxious and scared, my parents go outside and come back just fine and so many people do too, but i just can't even cross to the next neighborhood out of fear of getting jumped slashed robbed or worse.", "score": 9, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767557067.0, "id": "1q400y9", "author": "HollywoodSting666", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q400y9/is_anyone_else_afraid_of_going_outside_out_of/"}

I had been living in that awful city for too long as I was sort of stuck there because of university studies.\n\nI have started living again, not just surviving. Moving forced me to reconsider so many things about my life, forced me out of my comfort zones and the bad habits I had made for myself. I no longer feel unsafe daily, I don't have to walk past places that hold bad memories. I still struggle, but the struggle feels more... worth it, if that makes sense? Not everything feels like another hopeless obstacle. \n\nSure, I still get depressed, I had a bad episode yesterday where I got a trauma flashback and cried for hours, so it's no magic fix. And of course, the move itself was hard, but I decided to do it the right way and decluttered everything that no longer serves me. I can really recommend, if you can afford it, to try to do things right from \"the get go\". Like I decided that I was worth spending money on, got myself some new furniture (well, thrifted, so new for me, lol) that is better quality and suits my tastes better. Before lots of my stuff  was broken but I didn't think to replace it because I never thought I was worth something better. Now I even have the walls painted my favourite colour.

I’ve struggled with C-PTSD most of my life stemming from childhood. Back in 2016 my therapist recommended getting an ESA, which I did, and later in 2018 they unfortunately passed away extremely quickly due to cancer. The last day I had with them was extremely traumatic and has led me to have issues trusting that any animal is ever actually ok.\n\nI’ve been working on this a lot since then and I have been doing so much better in recent years.

I’ve trained myself to take vitals on a dog for this reason and she’s literally fine, logically I know this. She was seen by a vet last month and was absolutely fine. I think I got triggered by the amount she’s been sleeping since my first ESA slept a lot before they passed- but logically I know that it’s winter and the cold/dark naturally increases how much a dog sleeps. \n\nI have easily had 6 anxiety/panic attacks in the past 3 days about this. This is the furthest I’ve ever back slid and i genuinely feel like I’m going crazy. Unfortunately I don’t see my therapist again for another week and a half.

I feel like I can't trust anyone. The incident with the police happened because my husband and I had an argument, I asked him and our teenage son to leave my room because I needed to sleep some more. My husband wasn't happy about that. He had yanked the phone off my hands and threw it somewhere in our bedroom. I was so tired that I didn't even care about the phone. \nI fell asleep and loud voices and banging on my door woke me up. I had blocked my bedroom door with my clothes hamper, a big fan and some other stuff that I had in my bedroom. I just wanted to be left alone and sleep. I was startled out of a deep sleep. The police officers started to threaten me by saying that they were going to make a force entry. I kept on pleading with them to give me a chance to use the restroom and to remove the stuff that I had put in front of my door.\nHowever, once I did that, a few officers came into my bedroom and pinned me down on my bed trying to hand cuffed me. I have suffered from fibromyalgia for years. I also have carpal tunnel syndrome on both hands, as well as osteoarthritis of the spine. I had my carpal tunnel braces on, I wasn't being violent or confrontational. I kept on begging them not to hurt me. They didn't care. I don't even remember if they put the hand cuffs on the front or the back. They wanted me to make my way down the stairs by myself. I told them that I needed help. I also have heat intolerance and once the EMT strapped me very tightly on their stretcher, which hurt a lot. I kept on asking one of the officers to stand in a way that he could block the son, so I wouldn't passed out. He kept on moving. He also tried to ask me questions. I told them that I wasn't going to answer to anything. I memorized their names and some of their badge numbers. I wrote everything down while I spent 7 horrible days in a mental hospital. They hospital violated so many of my patients rights!\nI have been confined to the corner of my couch ever since that fateful day. It all happened on November 1st of 2025. I've been experiencing so much anxiety. I haven't been able to go back to sleep in my bedroom. I can't hardly do anything, but pray, cry, and watch TV. I've been on permanent disability for treatment resistant depression since 2011. I was able to function somewhat day by day. I took care of my son and things around the house.\nI can't even do that right now. My son's already 19 years old. So he can do things on his own.\nI've tried to look into getting a lawyer to sue the police department and the hospital, but most of them want me to be paralyzed or something in order to take my case. One of them advice me to write a letter, paste or copy and send it to a website where a lot of attorneys could look at it and tell me if I have a case. I don't know how to do all that stuff. I've spent my life taking care of everyone and everything, and I left the workforce before the dental office where I worked turned everything digital.\nI had a telehealth appointment with my psychiatrist, and I told him that I was feeling stuck, depressed, and extremely anxious. He prescribed me a new medication that has very bad side effects. I'm already dealing with various physical health problems, and this new medication will make them worse.\nI do not want to die. I just want to get better, but nobody's helping me. I can't even drive right now because I wasn't able to go renew my driver's license on time due to my physical issues.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "The best thing you could do in this situation might be to consider any company that would reject you because you went to a negatively renowned high school not worthy of your talents. You sound like a good candidate for these internships, so you will likely be hired soon enough by someone. You kind of have the luxury to ignore whatever bias some hiring manager has for you. Imagine what it's like to live in a small town but be from a disdained minority or to be a felon who's done their time but will always have that black mark on their resume. You've got it easy compared to a lot of people.\n\nThat said, I've been part of the interview process for a large corporation and know what it's like to weed through hundreds of resumes from people applying for one single position. The task can be overwhelming. So many applications offer the same stellar accomplishments, skills or references it's almost impossible to choose. Especially when the current employees can hardly afford to take much time to look over someone's qualifications, much less thoroughly interview them. Therefore, to narrow down one's list of top choices the interviewer might use any excuse to reject a person. This one might get tossed because they went to a rival university, that one because they live too far away from the job location, another one because they have the same first name as a current coworker. It could literally be anything.\n\nWhen a prospective employee makes it to the interview stage, there are additional obscure reasons for the hiring manager to move on to the next applicant. The interviewee may wear a color that the interviewer doesn't like, they might stand or walk or talk in a way that seems odd or there may be something about the person's personality that just wouldn't be a good fit with the team. You for instance, sound like a very confident person. But the manager of the open position you're applying for may prefer to not have someone who's bold enough to challenge the boss' authority. Or smart enough to be bored with the job. The current coworkers may be uncomfortable with an intern who could make them feel inferior. Or the staff may not be able to relate well to a new person who has already worked for 3 national organizations and grew up doing media a lot as a teen. Those kinds of qualifications may sound a bit too pretentious for someone who's going to do a lot of filing and be sent out for coffee and to pick up everyone's lunch every day. So besides ability there's fit and a whole lot of intangibles that factor into the hiring process. \n\nAlso, have you considered how you may come across when that infamous high school is mentioned? Is it your reaction to the question, or perhaps the way you answer it that makes people react with that same stupid face that is like a mix of pity and that surprised picachu meme? Are you projecting your discomfort onto your interviewers? You mentioned PTSD. Does hearing the name of your alma mater trigger your symptoms in some way? Do you freeze, start to tear up, get sad, angry or frightened at that moment? How about dissociation? Does your mind wander for a second? Is there too long of a pause before your response? Or too short? A tic? A sigh? A crestfallen look? A defiantly set jaw? Is it you that's thrown off for the rest of the interview, not the person who asks that question? \n\nThere's nothing wrong with any of those reactions. You're a survivor and however you manage triggers to your PTSD should be acceptable. Unfortunately, not everyone you encounter will know how to manage their own emotions about the school shooting. And therefore they are unlikely to know how to be around you. They don't have to work through the complex feelings surrounding such a tragedy every day and your presence will be a constant reminder of it to them So, it's easier for them to decline your application than to figure out how to deal with what happened to you.  \n  \nLike all survivors you carry the additional burden of everyone else's emotional responses to your experiences. It wasn't your fault. But it will always be your cross to bear. It seems as if you're coping quite well though. Whatever strength and determination that has gotten you through life until now are precious and valuable skills. You're tough and resilient. The tribulations of defense or aerospace engineering jobs in a corporate environment will probably be a breeze for you.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Really difficult time working with older male coworker", "text": "I have felt increasingly anxious and on edge around my coworker. Also I am a woman in my early twenties - he is in his late fifties. Idk if this has any impact on our dynamic or working relationship but I felt I should mention it for context. \n\nAt the beginning when he was training me, everything was great. I loved working with him! Eventually we got closer and he offered to help me get a PC. He told me I could come over and build it in his apartment. He also another time told me I could go out riding with him on his motorcycles sometime. Another time he showed me a photo of him when he was younger and asked me to point out which one I thought he was. I thought it would be smart to point out the most handsome one. I guess I also kind of had a little crush on him at this point and hoped he was the most handsome one? Idk. He responded by saying “That makes me super happy” So I guess he was pleased with my response. He also shared with me at one point what he wants from a relationship and how he wants to “take the lead” and have a bunch of chemistry. \n\nHe would also tell me all these stories about his life and the things he’d done and he seemed like a really cool guy. And super smart. (Hence the tiny “crush”) He told me he would actually be a millionaire today if it weren’t for selling his bitcoin. And that he could actually practice as a college professor if he wanted to. And that he went to highschool with this popular politician in our area and is still friends with him and they hang out. He’d also complained that his friends always want to hang out but he just doesn’t have time. \n\nKeep in mind this man is decades older than me. I believed everything he said. Not saying he lied, but my therapist told me he might just be looking to impress me?? Idk…He also would offer to give me stuff bc he had a bunch of equipment. At one point he told me I could help him with his “business” by making videos for it. He said I could come over/set up somewhere and he had all the equipment. He told me he’d pay me for this. That he would film &amp; I’d act. For reference I had shared I would like to do content creation and he told me he could help me be an “influencer” and also that the sites he’s post the videos to just tend to do better if it’s a woman. The idea of being alone with him made me uncomfortable for some reason it just did and I didn’t feel comfy with it so I declined. \n\nBack to the PCs - when it came to actually getting the PCs from him I started to get uncomfortable with the idea of us meeting up. I also declined to go out with him (I laughed thinking he was joking, then he told me he was serious…I don’t think it was good that I laughed. I guess I didn’t know how to respond when he said he’d take me out on his motorcycles) I think because I was so friendly and open with him, he thought I might want to hang out?? \n\nAnyways I was so uncomfortable with meeting up with him that I ended up never getting the PC equipment from him and telling him that I was just going to build one with my brother. It’s funny bc he didn’t even ask me in the first place if I wanted to work on the PCs with him together. He just made it an “us” thing. And it was uncomfortable for me. \n\nThings in our working relationship have started to shift. I don’t know whether his behavior changed at any point or if I just began noticing certain things. He cuts me off and always talks over me. When I’m going to tend to a customer, he interrupts and takes over to speak with them. When I say something, he acts dismissively. For example he asked me my thoughts on something the other day - and then when I was talking cut me off and said “I get it.” Like he was just exhausted with me - even though he asked me for my thoughts. Just little things like that have begun happening every shift. I’ve started creating some distance but it still seems like he might have something against me. \n\nI’m writing all of this down because I have not spoken to anyone about my feelings or experiences. I am only mentioning certain things that have happened to give an idea of how our working relationship has been and context for why I feel a bit on edge or why I think things may have changed. I’m worried bc I’ve declined all these offers from him that I’ve upset him somehow. I feel bad because maybe I gave him the wrong idea? I can be flirty at times without even meaning to. I struggle with hyper-sexuality but I feel I have a pretty good handle on it at work tbh. I’m afraid I totally lead him on or something. \n\nWorking with him is very difficult for me. I’m not sure if I’m just imagining all of this. I’m not sure if it’s my fault the relationship has taken a weird turn. I just don’t feel good working alongside him. But everybody loves him and he’s friends with the boss. So. Any advice??

How Do I Navigate Feeling Numb to Things That Are Distressing to Others?", "text": "Today my mother found the body of an elderly family friend when she went over to visit. It was a very difficult experience for her and both her and my brother were very emotionally affected when she recounted the story.\n\nThey were crying and going through it, and even though I am normally the very emotional one, I immediately felt more concerned with taking care of them. \n\nYes, I am sad that I will never talk to our friend again and I am sad that she died in a less than comfortable way, but there is no disbelief or shock or complex emotions for me like there are for my family or like there would have been before PTSD. I just wish our friend well in whatever comes next and thank her for being here while she could. \n\nI can't help but feel like something has changed in my grief response since I sustained PTSD. The incidents that caused this disorder for me both include me believing that someone is dead or in peril, so when someone passes away, I just kind of feel numb, like it's almost expected even when it is sudden. If it doesn't trigger a flashback, then I feel very little.\n\nAfter PTSD, I am only greatly affected by the deaths of young people, people I am incredibly close to, suicides, and watching other people grieve (things that are  very traumatic for me and related to my initial traumatic experiences). Otherwise, it just feels as if someone has stepped out the door and decided not to come back in. Sad, but a reality.\n\nDoes anyone else experience this numbness? How do I deal with feeling this way while still supporting and caring for my family who feel very differently than I do?

I am working together with a tech specialist to remove some documents from devices that I believed were used by the stalker to see what I was writing or doing online.

When I meet new people, I wonder if the stalker sent them to infiltrate in my life and give him information.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Need to know the feeling will stop?", "text": "So long story short, my therapist a couple years ago said I had PTSD from abusive dad and ex partners, I wrote it off bc the abuse wasn’t that bad in my mind to cause something like that and I had already been diagnosed and working on my BPD so o figured I’m just more sensitive. \n\nCut to yesterday. I’m 4 months postpartum, I’m exhausted. My husband was home and he is a very gentle individual and he’s never made me feel in danger as my last partner had. We were bickering a bit, I understand he’s been under a lot of stress lately with work but I just needed him to sit with our baby so I could have a break. Not 5 mins after sitting with the baby and me doing dishes he comes out tells me I pissed him off so he doesn’t have the patience for dealing with LO and I’m sent in to comfort a fussy little one as I do every day. Exasperated, I mutter something along the lines of “thanks for the help” and he came into our room, rage in his voice like I’ve never heard towards me, saying “I’m no help? I do everything for you(I’m on leave, we planned on having me stay at home with LO as childcare is something we can’t even fathom affording)” and on kind of looking for a fight. I shut down and got quiet and calm and told him to get the fuck out and he slammed the door not super hard but def with more force than necessary. Since that moment, I have been completely disassociated. I found myself in the following moments of that interaction taking note of what the nearest thing I could use as a weapon if he came back in angry, taking inventory of what I need to gather to take LO, myself and my pets to my mothers, what I would need to come back for etc. since calming we’ve talked about what happened. He apologized and understands how that triggered me and how we must go about things in the future bc I will not raise my child with an angry man in the house after I spent so long building a peaceful home myself until I met him(and built with him after.) I know things will not be that way, that he is not an angry man. But my body can’t make eye contact. I can’t feel anything but on edge since the interaction. How long should I feel like this?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "I was sexually abused twice as a child and now I romanticize death - I'm losing myself and I like it.", "text": "Hey everyone... I (M20) am here to vent because I’ve felt completely lost in life for a long time, and when I say \"a long time,\" I mean it. It feels like it’s always been this way.\nMy name is Davi. For as long as I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by the macabre, the melancholy, and the darker side of things. I grew up in poison, and I feel like I’ll die in poison.\nMy mother had me very young, at 23. I was the product of an unstable and violent relationship; both my parents were—and still are—drug addicts. Since I was little, I saw things no child should ever see: I caught my parents having sex in front of me, constant fights, and my father stealing the money my grandfather sent for my expenses just to buy drugs and alcohol. By the time I was 5, I was already hearing my mother say that everything was my fault and that she wished she’d never had me.\nMy memories are a bit blurred until I was 7, but I remember the divorce clearly. It was chaos. I remember my father smashing beer bottles over my mother’s head the day she decided to leave and take me to my grandparents' house. At the time, she was already pregnant with my sister—also my father's child. He used to hit both of us, and there were days we went hungry because of his addictions.\nEven after moving to my grandparents', the physical and psychological abuse from my mother continued. She beat me, screamed at me, and repeated that I should never have been born. This lasted until I was 12, when she met a guy and moved in with him on the very first day they met. If I’m alive today, it’s thanks to my grandparents; they’re the ones who truly raised me and still look after me.\nWhen I was 7, the first thing happened that destroyed any chance of me having a normal life: a babysitter sexually abused me. She touched me, took my virginity, and showed me pornography... it completely messed up my head.\nAt 9, the second abuse happened, this time by an older cousin (16 at the time). He did much worse things. I didn’t fully understand it was wrong back then; I just felt an enormous discomfort, but I didn’t tell anyone. I thought no adult would do anything and that I was just being \"dramatic.\" But that changed me forever. I became a silent, quiet child with morbid thoughts that I carried through my entire childhood and adolescence.\nTo this day, it haunts me. After those abuses, I developed very heavy fetishes—autassassinophilia, thanatophilia, ageplay, non-con (NCN), things like that. I have a morbid obsession with blood: I love seeing my own blood spill, and I love seeing the suffering of others.\nMy psychologist and psychiatrist have already mentioned hospitalization, but I can’t... I have bills to pay, responsibilities. And deep down, I romanticize death so much that sometimes I feel like that’s where I’m headed. I imagine it in a way no one else understands.\nThis is my story. I feel myself sinking deeper and deeper into the shadows... and the worst part is, I like it. I feel at home there.\nI’m posting this because I need to get it out. Has anyone ever gone through anything similar? How do you deal with the feeling of being lost forever? I’m trying to find the courage to keep living, but it’s hard, and I know I’ll put an end to this soon...

I grew up in a pretty dysfunctional family environment. I lost my sense of safety pretty early in my childhood. I have shared parts of what happened to me with various therapists, friends and extended family members. I don't feel like it has made much of a difference. I've been married for almost 32 years. I got married young. I barely shared some details of what happened to me with my husband, and he said that he felt horrible for what I went through. My husband's verbally and emotionally abusive. I thought that perhaps if I shared my experience of abuse he would take it easy on me. It's just been a couple of days since I told him, and he says that he's going to change the way he talks to me. I haven't seen a big difference yet. He's going to start to see a therapist, so that gives me a little bit of hope.\nMy advice for you would be to try to really work with a trusted therapist or maybe a counselor from your church.

If you don't work through it'll affect your relationship at some point. Talk this out with someone before you talk to your fiance. You're not obligated to share every little detail about that horrible experience. However, I don't think that it's wise to get married if you feel like you're can be open and honest with your fiancé. She probably also has had experiences or things that have happened to her and she hasn't shared them with you. \nI would advice anyone who's considering marriage to do some serious pre marital counseling. It'll make your marriage easier to navigate. Make sure that you find a marriage and family therapist. They can teach you proper communication techniques that you both can use. You shouldn't feel afraid to speak to your future spouse. That's not a good sign. You are worthy of love and respect regardless of your life experiences.

I'm catholic, so I also have found great consolation by praying to mother Mary, and asking for the intercession of some of my favorite saints.

I also suffer from treatment resistant depression and paralyzing anxiety. The first thing that I do when I wake up each day is to listen to the scriptures of the day. I tell Jesus, Lord you know how I feel, you know what I'm going through. Please speak to me through your word. It hasn't failed me yet. I have an app on my phone called Laudate. That's what I used to listen to the daily scriptures and they also have a video reflection on the particular gospel and readings of the day. \nStay close to Jesus.

He was 27 and he eventually took my virginity It was very painful and i cried during it. he kept trying to have sex with me and hoped that the bleeding and pain would stop eventually but it didn't. bc usually the pain stops eventually when its your first time but it didn't with me. i bled for hours went home and  fainted there and ended up in the emergency room. I still don’t fully understand why it happened, but it was frightening and overwhelming.I didn't tell my friends and family the real reason. i just lied to the doctors that it was something else.\nI told him later that i was in the hospital after he took my V, he didn't care and got angry at me for telling him\nAfter that, I stayed with him for about three years. During that time, I fell in love with him, and he knew that. He often told me that he loved me as well.\n\nOver time, his behavior started to change. He began encouraging me to drink alcohol before sex. He always stayed sober himself, but pressured me to drink more until I was drunk. The sexual acts he wanted were things he only asked for when I was drunk  things I would never have agreed to while sober and that made me uncomfortable. I dont remember anything after\nWhen I was sober, sex was often painful for me. I was usually not wet enough, and it physically hurt, but he continued most of the times. But sometimes he would listen to me aswell and stop when i had pain? which is even more confusing to me. When I was drunk, I felt the pain less or reacted to it less. Looking back, I question whether he wanted me to be drunk on purpose so I wouldn’t feel the pain or resist. But also some days we would have normal sex where it didnt hurt me. Which makes me feel like im being dramatic?\n\nHe came inside me multiple times even though I clearly told him I did not want that. I said no to this repeatedly. Despite that, he continued to do it. Eventually, I stopped fighting it and let it happen because I loved him and didn’t want to lose him. Afterward, he often apologized, promised it wouldn’t happen again, and then repeated the same behavior.\nOften he told me we would just spend time together talk, relax, and not have sex. That is what I wanted, because I was seeking emotional connection. But as soon as I arrived at his house, he would start having sex with me without discussing it, often without saying anything at all. It felt like my wishes didn’t matter.\nWhen I tried to talk about my feelings or how bad I felt about everything, he calls me “dramatic” or started yelling at me. He dismissed my emotions and made me feel like I was overreacting.\nDuring sex, he often put pornography on a large screen and wanted me to do the same things he was watching. I felt objectified, like I was being used rather than being with a partner. It was about acting out what he wanted, not about mutual consent or care.\nHe also regularly told me that no one else wanted me, that I only had him, and that I needed him. This made me insecure and dependent, and it kept me in the relationship even though it felt wrong.\n\nWhat do you guys think about this situation?\nNow that im 26 years old everything starts hitting me and i didnt realise at the time how bad i was treated. i feel like i thought it was normal?\nIs that weird. \nI kept going back to him with my own choice which is why im blaming myself.

I think we really mistake what is love which is right or what is abuse, if we didn’t learn how to be loved in a right way in our childhood. And 19 is the exactly delusional hard year for us to realize where ppl n law start to treat you as an adult and you already consider yourself as an adult  but in reality you’re not. \nI had similar relationship as yours too at 19, n forced to tolerate the pain n being told that keep having sex often to really feel the real sex ! But shit didn’t change in 3 years, i had an abortion during that time cuz i was still kid at the time and thank god i was stubborn as hell to stand on my opinion. That relationship lasted 3 years too but i’ve stupidly mistaken for a loooong time that was still real love and romanticized it as “oh my first love….” Bullshit !! \nNow i’m 27 and realize we (women) are fucking people pleasers from the beginning. I’m now hesitating if it is how every family raise their girls or naturally females are born gentle and fragile af. I can’t find the reason why we act like this. Honestly it all happened to me because I had a rough childhood, abandoned by my parents, ignored my feelings, always quiet to please others, always trying to be a good girl…,etc. I didn’t know what was love for my whole life. Maybe for me someone’s attention is love or tolerating the pain and accepting it is love idk but i’m still learning and being the adult for myself to teach myself everything. I still can’t have a healthy relationship and accept to be loved in a right way. But now i do realize that my first relationship was just a nightmare ! \n\nThen on the other hand,  i don’t know where u live but wherever u are we, women don’t talk about the sex enough! We don’t educate ourselves and our girls how to have sex, how to feel pleasure, how to have an orgasm because most of us actually don’t know how to feel good during sex !!! We still treated having a sexual education as shameful or banned topic!!! That is why we never talk about the first time pain with each other !!!! I still can’t believe why we always choose to stay quiet. The society blame us, friends talk behind our backs … we all have this social anxiety…. \n\nFinally guuurl, what i’m trying to say is don’t blame yourself! Never ever blame yourself! Teach your inner child how to be loved again, educate yourself and never ever accept any kind of abuse like that ever again !!! 🫂 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🫶🏻", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767492093.0, "id": "nxjuc1k", "author": "GulAranjinmaa"}

So if youre focusing on fear, you would try to scan your body and notice where/how you feel the fear. For me, its often a high energy feeling in my hands or feet (it feels like I need to run for my life) or a tightness in my stomach. After you identify the feeling, then you do the bilateral movement to kind of access the memory. **The feeling of fear IS your memory**. Eventually more discrete imagery or memories may show up, or they may not. Its okay if they never do. \n\nThat being said, I cant suggest IFS enough. IFS + EMDR was the winning combination for me. \n\nEMDR alone left a lot to be desired in terms of context for me because like you, I was very distracted by feeling like: \"why does it work?\" \"this feels awkward and somewhat silly\" \"i feel embarrassed doing this\". \n\nI actually shut down a lot during EMDR because essentially I felt stupid doing the movements or humiliated or kind of cynical about it. IFS helped me address and soothe those feelings so I could actually turn my focus towards the trauma itself.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1767453187.0, "id": "nxg6tej", "author": "Streetquats"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "The Invisible Physicality of Trauma", "text": "Trigger Warning: CSA, Suicide\n\n*Hello everyone, I initially wrote this piece for my Substack, however later changed my mind on publishing it as I was unsure if I wanted to make my story public. I still hope for this reading to help struggling souls out there so I am now posting it anonymously on Reddit. Sending so much love to you all* ❤️\n\n*——*\n\nFor years, I wasn’t convinced I had PTSD. I didn’t have nightmares or flashbacks, which was all I had associated PTSD with. In fact, I didn’t feel anything about the years I was sexually abused by my father as a little girl.\n\nThis continued on into my early adult life. As a teenager I hated my father, and I hated my mother for choosing to stay despite knowing what had happened. To this day, it’s hard to reconcile with her decision. I put it down to her fawning dependence on my dad, but ultimately part of the healing I still must do is accepting that her decision does not determine my will to live.\n\nBecause my only source of family had betrayed me, I desperately searched outwards during my teenage years, clinging onto any superficial sense of love and safety that I could find. I was one of those people that could never stay single, and I hated myself for it. I couldn’t put my finger on why everyone but me was okay with not having a partner, and I chalked it up to a moral failing within me. I was ashamed but couldn’t help myself. The embrace of a toxic relationship felt safer than home. It also lended me a place to stay - I rarely went home.\n\nIt is fascinating to me how much of my upbringing was shaped trauma, despite consciously feeling like I was “strange” for being able to shrug off my history of sexual abuse. I developed anorexia nervosa in middle school, and high school was laden with self-hatred and desperate attempts to connect. I kept friends that talked behind my back in fear that if I cut ties, my world would be truly empty - a reflection of my belief that nobody cared about me. I was persistently unhappy.\n\nIn university, the physicality of my trauma slowly began to surface. Brain fog and memory issues set in. I was severely exhausted more days than not for no discernible reason. I was at a loss to what was happening and extremely frustrated. I had once considered myself “smart”. Now, I felt like the one thing I liked about myself was slipping through my grasp.\n\nIt wasn’t until I moved away from my hometown for medical school that the PTSD symptoms became impossible to ignore. At the time, I didn’t recognize it as PTSD. Trauma-related lectures during the psychiatry and paediatrics blocks were met with panic attacks. So were several clinical skills sessions, where I embarrassingly burst into tears in front of my tutor.\n\nI desperately tried to “cure” myself, connecting with a therapist and taking medications. Unfortunately, curing myself took a backseat to medical school, and I was rarely engaged during therapy. The concepts discussed in therapy felt so abstract at the time that I had inadvertently convinced myself that it was “hocus-pocus”. However, with overwhelming scientific evidence behind the benefits of therapy, I decided to trust the science and kept attending sessions whenever I could in hopes that one day it would “magically” cure me.\n\nThe interesting thing about trauma therapy is that it will feel worse before it gets better. Therapy and school both shone a light on the past I had tucked away in the back of my mind. I was becoming more aware of how much my trauma contributed to the parts I hated about myself, and an unyielding sense of hopelessness began to wash over me as I mourned what could have been a “better” me.\n\nI connected my physical symptoms - nausea/vomiting, IBS, frequent headaches, brain fog, and fatigue - to my past. I connected my longstanding struggle with mental health to my past. It felt like my past had permanently ruined my future. When I started my psychiatry rotation and began having frequent panic attacks from patients with stories similar to mine, these thoughts only amplified as I felt that I could no longer become a doctor. Eventually these thoughts consumed me. I attempted to take my life by overdosing.\n\nI could not begin to describe how ironic the experience of waking up in the psych ward was. One minute, I’m a “competent” medical student interviewing patients and feigning that I had everything together. The next, I was on the other side, my identity there inscribed by the darkest moment of my life. At the same time, my classmates were on the same ward as me doing exactly what I had been doing just the week before - providing care to patients. I spent the majority of my time in the hospital cooped up in bed hiding from my classmates.\n\nThat incident occurred just two months ago. At the time, I was ambivalent about being alive - not relieved my attempt failed, but not devastated either. I chose to take a leave of absence for a year to dedicate myself to healing. While I am occasionally still ambivalent about life, today I can appreciate the beauty life has to offer (especially in nature). That small change brings me hope.\n\nTo be diagnosed with PTSD, it is not a requirement to have nightmares or flashbacks. If anybody is interested, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria can be found [here](https://www.psychdb.com/trauma-and-stressors/ptsd). What I was experiencing was PTSD, and when that was clear to me, I began to research how I can heal. My PTSD was predominantly somatic, and previously I had believed that I would forever have to fight my body. I thought that I would never live to be the best version of myself.\n\nSince then, I have found hope in the little strides I have made. *The Body Keeps the Score* is a wonderful book which helped me understand the physicality of trauma, and motivated me to take on more physical/grounding healing techniques like yoga and meditation. I also became fully engaged in therapy and diligently did the work outside of my sessions. My leave of absence gave me the gift of time.\n\nUnfortunately, stories like mine are all too common. I frequently saw the manifestations of this in psychiatry and paediatrics. I share this in the hope that those in similar situations will feel a glimmer of reassurance that their future is not lost. When I slowed my world down, understood what my body was telling me rather than trying to fight it, and focused on healing, my symptoms began to ease. I am vomiting less, I am having fewer panic attacks, and I am slowly regaining my energy. Today, I believe that this journey is long and difficult, but doable. While it’s only been two months and I still have a lot of growing to do, I can now see that my past did not destroy my future. My future is still mine to build.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767419724.0, "id": "1q2mpzw", "author": "throwaway193026748", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q2mpzw/the_invisible_physicality_of_trauma/"}

I am doing a lot of better, but I still have my moments, y'know?\n\nAnyway, my parents were arguing about something, and I suddenly started to remember my highschool times when they argued all the time (this includes throwing things, throwing threats, yelling at 6 a.m. before I went to school, etc.). I had to retreat to my room so I could have a bit of space to cry and cool down. My mom later asked me what was going on, and I told her I was just having a trauma response and I needed some time to cool down.\n\nI reminded her that I was not mad at her or my dad, I understand that married couples have their moments. However, this was just kind of an involuntary thing that happens, so I needed like, 15 minutes and I would be fine.\n\nBasically, she said, \"oh, you're just being moody,\" and that I had no reason to cry. Even more, while I was still actively crying, she made me stand in front of the family and explain myself (in which she shot down). It was not fun.\n\nI retreat later into my room, crying even more now because of that embarrassment-fest, and my brother goes to check in on me.\n\nAccording to him, neither of my parents are taking me seriously, and my mom recited a time when I was 15 and told my mom, \"not to cry,\" when she was crying about something. She said, \"he's just heartless,\" as a reason to bring up this story and thus, a reason to not care about my current traumatic response.\n\nShe brings this up all the time. I am 21 now. This has been years. I have gone to therapy since then, and have moved out, attended college, etc.\n\nAlso, that moment she is talking about; I was being abused by her (I mean, reporting her to the police type of abuse) so *I'M SORRY* if I was a little bitter toward my mom at the time.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Bad reactions to SSRIs and MDMA bad trips: managing the aftermath of serotonin syndrome/serotoninergic toxicity", "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've suffered from serotoninergic toxicity on 3 occasions in less than 2 years, twice on low doses of MDMA (half a pill), and once on a very low dose of an SSRI (5mg of Escitalopram). I'm here mostly to raise awareness because these conditions are wildly unknown, underdiagnosed, underestimated and many people who go through this suffer greatly from the aftermath.\n\nI would like to preface this by saying that the doses that I have taken did not cause severe serotonin syndrome per se, and people who go through the worst forms of this get induced into an artificial coma and may suffer from neurological disorders for long periods of time after this. This is a testimony of a midler case of serotoninergic toxicity. However, the medical community will often tell you that there is no in-between, and that you either have to go through the ER or simply had a panic attack. The truth is that there are levels to this, and that there are even genetic tests that can show you have some genes that don't interact well with serotonin-altering drugs. Furthermore, I am neurodivergent (AuDHD), and I believe that might have played a role into this.\n\nI've noticed that the people who went through this often say the same thing: \"wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy\". I genuinely would rather get every single one of my nails and toenails snapped off than go through the worst sertoninergic toxicity I experienced again. I will first describe the 2nd MDMA \"bad trip\" and the SSRI negative reaction, then will go on to talk about the long and scary process of recovery, hopefully giving some hope to those who have experienced a similar thing.\n\n**The MDMA:**\n\nIt is genuinely traumatic for me to recall this but the MDMA bad trip first made me puke, a lot. I was drinking water and puking, kept drinking water and puking, as if I was giving myself a stomach rinse. Then, I felt extreme heat and had to remove all my clothes and get a cold shower, it legit made me have seizures, derealization, feeling like there was \"lightning\" in my brain, tremors, shaking, and the worst feeling of \"I'm about to die\" ever. I couldn't describe just how awful and terrible it is, like your body turning into a prison and simply making you go through all of the worst feelings known to humans. I was shaking and feeling horrible for hours, and didn't start feeling better until 2 days later. It's like the entire time all I did was tried to stay focus on calming the fuck down and telling myself I am not going to die. I was taken to the ER, they did an EKG that was normal, the staff was almost laughing at me for being so freaked out from such a small dose. And even then, it took months to feel normal again. I don't want to go into too much details because I am literally shaking recalling this experience (and I'm very resilient, I've been through pretty bad regular stuff before, assaults, civil war, but nothing has traumatized me quite like this). This was in November 2024. \n\nThe second worst part of this, besides the experience itself, is that it makes you develop **PTSD** and **anxiety**. First, I couldn't take anything that vaguely ressembles a pill: vitamins, candy, you name it, it just triggered such a strong reaction in me. I realized that I was tensing up my muscles all the time. Couldn't take any stimulants like coffee, tea or energy drinks as it would make my heart race. Was a regular weed smoker before that, now I can't even take a puff without having anxiety. I also developed costochondritis, which is basically rib pain. Weeks later, I woke up in the middle of the night with a flare-up of costochondritis, and panicked, thought I was having a heart attack, my heart was pounding so fast and strong in my ears, and felt like I almost fainted, proceeded to spend 8 hours in the ER so that they would rule out risks of venous thrombosis, all tests turned out fine. \n\nEither way, it took me months to feel like I was somewhat back to normal and not on edge all the time, and a year later I still couldn't smoke any weed, or consume any strong doses of caffeine. The recovery process is slow but it is there. \n\n**The Escitalopram:**\n\nNow this was really surprising and happened less than a month ago (December 10th 2025). I started experiencing bad depression, crying in bed all day type of thing, I had started therapy again but felt like it wasn't enough. I was prescribed 5mg Escitalopram by a GP after telling them about my sensitivity to substances, they insisted that this was lighter than Fluoxetine and that the dose was very low. I've even read people online saying that this dose was too low to even do anything. I really, really, really beg to differ. First, I started walking a lot, I walked around the city for legit 2 hours, as I felt restless. I went home, started feeling too hot, puked once, took a shower, and then a different but familiar type of torture began. I had tingles all over my limbs, tremors, nausea, derealization, my gut was feeling horrible, felt like part of face was swollen, like electricity was running through my scalp, and very weird temperature sensations, either too hot, or too cold. The very worst part was the sleeplessness, I just couldn't sleep for the life of me, the moment I would drift off my body would panic and wake me up, and this went on for days, especially since after the the first time I managed to sleep for less than two hours, when I woke up, I started feeling like my body was literally burning but also being put in an ice bath at the same time. It felt as horrible as it sounds, and everytime I would only sleep for less than two hours and wake up drenched in sweat. After a week or so, I started feeling better, but two days ago, more than twenty days after this happened, I had an \"echo\" (seems to be common with this experience), I didn't take anything, but I left the heater on way too strong and I woke up feeling way too hot, started shaking uncontrollably, temperature feeling weird, anxiety through the roof, and it took me 2 days of not being able to sleep normally again (slept 6 hours over 2 days in bouts of an hour and a half), to manage to sleep 9 hours in chunks and feel better. I went back to the doctor after the bad reaction and they told me they have never seen anyone react this strongly to such a low dose.\n\n**This is the most important message I want to share through this post**: you WILL get better. The scariest aftermath from this experience is wondering if you permanently damaged your brain or organs and if you will ever get to feel better. If you had a mild case like me, you 100% will, just give it some time. I came accross the case of another Reddit user who had a huge dose and was expericing tremors and muscle jerking years later, and who also recovered despite considering assisted death at some point.  \nI assure you, it is very likely that the lingering symptoms you are experiencing are **anxiety and PTSD**, not nerve or brain damage. You don't need to \"fix\" your brain chemistry with benzos or serotonin blockers. It doesn't mean that \"it's all in your head\", or that the physical symptoms aren't real, but once the substances have cleared out of your system, you are most likely alright, even though it's very real and very scary. Look up the symptoms and you will see that anxiety can cause tremors, muscle jerking, gut problems and sleep disorders. I still strongly encourage you to go to a doctor, hospital or neurologist and get all the tests that you can, because either way it will make you feel better as the tests will most likely show there is nothing physically wrong. \n\nI am no doctor, but I strongly advise you to stop taking anything: no meds, definitely no SSRIs, not even Tylenol, definitely no weed, not even CBD, no coffee, etc. as it will make your recovery faster and smoother. I advise you to take magnesium, vitamin C, mild herbal teas like chamomille, but don't even take things like Ashwagandha until you start feeling better, as it might trigger you. I strongly recommend Yoga Nidra, meditation, diaphragm breathing and the likes, as well as maintaining a very healthy lifestyle: good diet, working out, regular nighttime sleep, get some daylight, go out walking, get some social interaction, etc. If you are currently experincing serotoninergic toxicity, or are trying to help someone expericing it (soon after intake, like immeditaly after to 72 hours after) you could look into or request Cyproheptadine, again I am no doctor, it's an H1 antihistamine and most doctors will be at a loss as to how to treat this, but all the testimonies I've read say that those who have received this treatment felt better. Don't take it long after the substances have cleared out, it's unnecessary and will most likely make things worse.\n\nAlso, I'd like to say that all of this happened after I experienced some really bad events in my personal life (breakup after LTR, death of loved ones) that made me pretty vulnerable, and that I was peer pressured into taking MDMA. After the first bad reaction I was told it was probably the provider, or the conditions I took it in, the second time (worst time), I had refused to take any, but was with people who were under the influence and were having a really good time on higher doses, so they insisted and I gave in (ultimate people pleaser, I know). As for the Escitalopram, I expressedly asked the doctor for Sulpiride/Dogmatil as I knew I would probably react badly to an SSRI, but again, they insisted. I think you should listen to your gut and not make the same mistake as I did, you know yourself better than anyone else, don't let anyone gaslight you. \n\nI would also like to mention that many people have actually reported very bad side effects caused by SSRIs and even SNRIs, or even opiods like Tramadol. Some of the worst testimonies I've read were caused by Cymbalta which is an SNRI. You will not find a lot about this on Google but there are so many testimonies online it's actually frightening that there isn't more about this and that doctors are prescribing these so easily. I know many people had big improvements in their lives from taking these but I feel like they're purposefully promoted and that negative experiences are silenced for profit, serotoninergic toxicity and serotonin syndrome are much, much more common than reported. If you can manage (and you most likely can) to recover from depression and/or anxiety without these, then by all means avoid them at all costs. Some people who had bad reactions had done gene testing and even if the tests said they were fine to take them they still had bad reactions. ALWAYS take the smallest possible dose before increasing, only if you MUST take them. There is no way to know if you are like me, and I know if I had taken a higher dose, I would probably would have *ruined my life* and not be capable to function, I would probably be a disabled vegetable incapable of living alone or caring for themselves, let alone work or study. If you are suicidal, PLEASE do not try to overdose on SSRIs or SNRIs, not only will you most likely not die, but you will most likely have the absolute worst experience of your life that will leave you feeling debilitated for years. It will not kill you, it will just ruin your life and health. If you previously had bad reactions to either MDMA/Ecstasy, or SSRIs, it is very likely you will have a bad reaction to the other. Both are OPTIONAL substances, that you don't have to take. There ARE alternatives, even medical ones, to treat depression and anxiety, I am not being that type of person \"just work out and eat healthy\", but these are serious substances that can be life altering, I 100% would rather be depressed and anxious than go through this shit again. \n\nI'm sorry if this post is long, but I had genuinely struggled to piece information about all of this, and I know what it's like to suffer from this and be at a loss as to what's happening to you, so it's very important for me to share details as I know how relieving it can be to see that you are not alone, that someone had the same symptoms as you and that you can totally recover.\n\n**TL;DR**: had horrible reactions to small doses of MDMA/Escitalopram, was gaslit by nearly everyone including doctors that it was all in my head and that I didn't have a particular sensitivity to these substances, it nearly ruined my life, now I'm recovering from anxiety and PTSD caused by these experiences.", "score": 7, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1767391792.0, "id": "1q2c9am", "author": "DriverNo5100", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q2c9am/bad_reactions_to_ssris_and_mdma_bad_trips/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Trying to find a name for what my parents are", "text": "I’m in my mid-20’s now, and it’s taken me years, well up until this point in my life to realize  that my parents were pretty emotionally neglectful at times and that my childhood wasn’t as spectacular as I always thought it to be. It’s hard because I still see so much of my childhood and parents behavior as normalized and my parents are actively very loving people, so it’s hard to know which of their behaviors are not okay, and I’m only making the connections now of the mental health issues I have at this age and how that stemmed from how my parents reacted and treated me.\n\nI was reading a book on emotional immaturity a couple years ago bc my boyfriend was very emotionally immature, and I found that it rang very true for my parents, because I always felt like I was responsible for their emotions and feelings, and I still do. \n\nI feel like putting labels to my parents traits has been helpful to try to validate my experiences, but I’m struggling to find which labels are accurate.\n\nI don’t see my parents are narcissists, at most potentially emotionally manipulative at times. Today I’m thinking about things like how whenever I was sick as a kid, my parents just made me go to school anyway because they didn’t want me to miss school, so only if I were throwing up, and even then, sometimes I’d still have to go to school. And now because of that whenever I’m sick I think that I’m lying to myself of how I’m feeling or overreacting.\n\nOr how I never really learned how to assert my needs because whatever my parents wanted me to do, take care of or help with was always more important than how I felt or what I wanted at the time.\n\nI’m also thinking about how one of my siblings is trans and my parents just deadname them all the time, and I talk to them about it, but they’re just not ready to use the preferred name/pronouns, or simply don’t want to. And my parents are African immigrants and 60+ so I see some of it as cultural and generational, but it also just seems like an inability to be empathetic to my sibling and validate their lived experience of their gender and personhood.\n\nI just don’t feel like my parents ever learned to validate my siblings and I or our feelings, for one reason or the other, or see them as important. Would that be emotional neglect? Or perhaps that would be something else, unnamed.\n\nI live with them currently it’s so just very hard and confusing to decipher what behavior is healthy, harmful, helpful or not.

You can find the book online for free in some places. \n\nEven if some of your parent's behaviour is helpful, if they have a history of harmful behaviour you may be hypervigilant and waiting for them to display harmful behaviour again. This becomes a pattern that makes it very difficult to heal around unsafe people. \n\nHere is a helpful link about the stages of trauma recovery. Make sure you do not skip step one.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "It can feel like a minefield when you understand why your parents react and parent the way they do. \n\nFrom the sounds of things, they're not bad people, and you don't seem to want to see them in that light either.\n\nGood people can be bad at handling their kids emotions, and meeting their emotional needs as they grow up. Often, they are doing the best with the resources they have, and it's important to recognise that much of this could also be generational trauma.\n\nYou can still have experienced emotional neglect, and recognise that this was traumatic and complex for you, all the while holding the truth that they may not have intended this. \n\nIt's okay to be hurt, to want to seek a name for your experience, and it's okay that all of this is hard to hold together and make sense of. \n\nWhatever words resonate for you are the ones you should use. \n\nFor me personally, I suffered years of homophobic and transphobic abuse under my parents. They didn't do this out of wanting to be bad people, but they did hurt me in many ways. It has stuck with me, and it's hard to go back and visit them, even though they are very different and more tolerant people now. \n\nIt's okay to call this neglect and abuse, if it helps you make sense of your experience. It doesn't mean that they are inherently bad. This is something I'm still trying to get to grips with, and it takes time, but sometimes naming it can help you understand what you have been through. \n\nIt sounds like you're still in this experience, too, which complicates much of the processing. Understanding now that what you're experiencing isn't right can be difficult, and it can make you doubt yourself when it has become so normalised. \n\nOne thing I am learning is that I'm the one now that must meet my emotional needs, and I don't wait or expect my parents to do that, as that only caused more pain. \n\nI don't know where your parents and siblings are at in that regard, though, and it may be that an open conversation is beneficial. That may not be possible, and it's okay to prioritise your safety (including emotional safety), when dealing with this. \n\nI wish you the best, from one survivor to another :)", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767376240.0, "id": "nxafyag", "author": "_intheory_"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Being queer in the global south", "text": "CWs: Mentions of SA, Physical Violence, Delusions\n\nI'm  transgender and was born in the USA but spent most of my life in my home country in East Africa. I'm ashamed to admit it but I spent most of my childhood with a severe inferiority complex caused by living in two countries of vastly different wealth. I spent a lot of time reading pretty much every racist study and statistic that existed. Thinking of myself as innately inferior helped me cope with low self esteem from my parents' poor treatment.\n\nI was already past most of it until I finished my first level of schooling and had to go to the high school level. In my country, doing boarding while you're a teen is pretty much expected so I ended up staying in one for one and half years.\n\nBeing in an all-male school was already pretty bad after knowing I was transgender a year before that, but the men in this environment were particularly bad.\n\nI've heard people here call it \"shock trauma\" and I think that describes what happened to me perfectly. Nothing that happened to me before that year could have ruined me to the same extent. Physical violence between students was pretty much the standard, you were expected to \"out-macho\" everyone constantly. Being hyper-religious was very common and we were expected to have prayers every week at minimum.\n\nPeople were sexist at best and hyper-misogynistic at worst. It was somewhat common for people to sexually harass female teachers (mind you this a sausage fest of like 20 guys per class) and offhandedly mention wanting to have sex with or just SA teachers or women (the latter was very uncommon fortunately). No one ever touched any teacher or student since this was a pretty high end school but even the suggestions stay with me till now. I still feel guilty and misogynistic for never speaking out even though the teachers themselves condoned it.\n\nThe guys were heavily homophobic as you may have guessed and \"played gay while calling each other slurs\" (the slur itself is a word I see westerners try to point to as evidence of normalized homosexuality so theres that haha). They had a \"gimmick\" for a long while of telling anyone who acted \"too gay\" they'd send them to the senior classes to be \"put straight\" (beaten up). A vocal minority had an obsession with \"shemales\" and fetishised them.\n\nAll of this messed up my head and made me feel like a sheep among wolves. I stopped considering myself properly bisexual and only get off to men when being emasculated and/or violated. What those people did is really just the top of the iceberg. I developed mildly delusional thinking and thought religious people everywhere were working to kill me, that I'd be cannibalized, that I lived in hell/a simulation, that birds could speak to me and lead me to escape. I even started believing (and still somewhat do) after I left that I have multiple personalities and only the jaded one could write this.\n\nI live in the USA (California) now at 17, my old inferiority complex caught back up with me haha and now all I can think about is the difference between here and there. I wonder whether the situation was in was ever even real or whether every other trans person in my country lived happily in contentedness. I wonder why being born in the USA let's me get off easier than my other queer classmates from families richer than mine. I'm able to buy HRT online easily with money I could never have hoped to get in my home country.\n\nIf any of you are/were in a situation similar to mine please comment. If not atleast upvote so someone can see it. I don't know if this is PTSD, but on most days all that fills my body and mind are the sensations of possible death/torture and I want to know if I can stop this before it gets worse and consumes me.", "score": 6, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767318103.0, "id": "1q1ljt5", "author": "Exact-Information844", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q1ljt5/being_queer_in_the_global_south/"}

Its not enioyable to be worrying. Its not fun. It doesnt really do anything. \n\nMore important than that, worrying is not love. You are not loving yourself when you are worrying. You are not loving yourself when you prepare for the worst case scenario.\n\n2. You still need to accept that you are worrying, but you gotta shift. Say okay I worried, I can do a tiny thing about that, but I aint gonna spend my days about it.\n\nYou need to deliberately, willfully, shift your thoughts towards something else. Your friends saved you that day, knowingly or not.\n\nSo go even more towards your friends. Stop sharing all the bad shit that happened to you to your friends, yeah its ok maybe necessary to do it sometimes, but its certainly not a life worth living to focus on that so much\n\nSo go even more towards your friends, talk to them, ask em whatever, give them fun and have fun yourself. Instead of worrying, ask em what they wanna do tonight and go donit with them. Be so fucking close and happy with them that you forget the bad shit for a moment.\n\nSight. Look its not easy. Abuse is one thing, but thats not our case. What happened to us is not abuse, its a long, winded, series of abuses and disappointement.\n\nWhat im saying is that you were groomed. Now you think like a victim, talk like a victim, and wouldnt you know being victimized is right up front next door.\n\nYou see, happy loving people that take care of eachother, bad things dont happen to them, and even if it does its not that bad.\n\nYou need to understand that its better to be shot in the back, than to look back your whole life to see if youre going to get shot at.

Basically, I skateboard a lot and I'm used to small injuries (bruises from falls, small scrapes, road burn, etc.), but in late August I had my first real skateboard injury, where I tried to go down a big hill, and tried to step off, giving me a tibial plateau fracture and a torn ACL. It was at night, so I waited until the next morning to go to the ER and sat there for 8 hours. I got no sleep the night before and a few 10 minute naps at the hospital. When I got home my parents were going to come pick me up after work to let me stay at their house, so I tried to catch up on some sleep while I waited, but I kept having flashbacks of me going down the hill, my leg jerking when I fell, which woke me up from the pain. This happened a couple times before I was eventually brought to my parents house and that was it.\n\nFlashforward to now, where I am all healed, with a little bit of pain when I bend my leg quickly or slightly stumble/trip. Recently I have been trying to get back into skateboarding, doing just small stuff like still-ground tricks, which has been going really well, until today. I was practicing in my carpeted basement when I fell for the first time since the injury, and I tried to catch myself on a box of tiles, but slipped, causing half of my hand to be cut on the tiles. It honestly wasn't a bad cut and I wasn't bleeding too badly, but for some reason I was feeling weird. I was lightheaded and felt faint, sweaty, really pale, very fidgety, and felt like I was going to throw up. I was at my parents house so my dad was helping me out and told me it made sense after what I went through. Its important to note that I have a pretty high pain tolerance, since I've been battered up a bit from skateboarding, like I was convinced that I sprained or dislocated my knee since I thought anything worse would hurt a hell of a lot more.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Witnessed my partner take a seizure and now i can’t sleep beside him anymore.", "text": "Hi, I am coming here for advice on a situation that recently occurred.\n\n\nAbout a month and a half ago my bf took a tonic clonic seizure in the middle of the night, 4.23am to be precise and I woke up to him face down and suffocating in his pillow. He has epilepsy and been diagnosed since he was a kid but in his 20s they became really bad, some twice a day.\n\n\nWhen I met him he was having seizures once a week but he never had them around me. He was put on a new really strong medication that was a last ditch effort to stop them and it seemed to have worked. \n\n\nWhen he took the seizure in my bed he hadn’t had one in over 4 months, I have spoken to his mum and him about why he took it like if his medications were maybe beginning to work ect since non had before but they both agreed that he took it because he had really high stress and barely any sleep that week, which are stressors for his epilepsy.\n\n\nThe problem is that I now cannot sleep beside him without having full blown panics, he twitches a lot in his sleep which brings me right back to when i woke up to him suffocating. The first sleepover after the seizure I had told him about the twitching and how i had never noticed it before and he is adamant that he had always had tremors in the night but I am a light sleeper and I would wake if he moved an inch but now I’m not sure if it’s because I am scared he’ll take another seizure beside me when i’m sleeping that i’m being extra cautious. I feel awful because I know it’s not his fault but I can feel myself not wanting sleepovers with him because I literally will not sleep the whole night until he takes his morning meds at 8am. I have tried taking myself to the sofa but all i can think about is him having a seizure and me not being there to put him in the recovery position ect. \n\n\nI’m just at a loss on what to do because I want to not be scared to sleep beside my bf he had never taken seizure during the night before and he hasn’t had one sense and I know that it’s illogical to think he’ll now be taking night seizures all the time even tho he sleeps fine every night at his own place.\n\n\nDoes anyone have advice on this? I really just don’t want to panic every time we sleep together because he tremors in his sleep and not have to listen to his breathing to make sure he’s not having a seizure.\n\n\nI apologise if this doesn’t make much sense as I am now having a hard time expressing what I mean and it seems to have cause a anxiety problem in my day to day life as well feeling like everyone is going to take a seizure around me. When we started dating i looking into epilepsy and seizures massively to have the best information about them when dating someone who was likely to take one with me but it doesn’t even seem to help me when i need it now.\n\n\n", "score": 10, "num_comments": 76, "created_utc": 1767304653.0, "id": "1q1gcxd", "author": "No_Map_7282", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q1gcxd/witnessed_my_partner_take_a_seizure_and_now_i/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "I am currently going through the same thing as you. My partner of 11 years had a tonic-clonic seizure almost 3 years ago, which turned into an 8 month long battle with a brain cancer called CNS Lymphoma. He ended up going into remission in October of 2023, and a year later, he had another seizure late at night while we were in bed. Thankfully he had a clear MRI after this, but this left me with PTSD ever since. \n\nJust two months ago, I was awakened in the middle of the night to him having another seizure, but this one was the most intense, with him \"snoring\" and breathing oddly afterwards, to the point the 911 operator had me put him into a position to help him breathe. He also had a much longer post-ictal period where he wandered around the house, not speaking, acting strangely, and not recognizing anyone around him. \n\nThe first few nights after this, I had to sleep in a separate bed because I was so traumatized, and couldn't stop having flashbacks of what had happened. I started to sleep with him again, but every time he would snore or even move in bed, I would panic, and at times I would wake him to make sure he was okay. It got to the point where a week ago, I had to go back to sleeping in the spare bedroom. Even sleeping away from him, I often think I am hearing a faint snoring sound, and I still panic and run to check on him, only to realize it was just my brain misinterpreting a repetitive hum coming from a fan as that snoring sound. \n\nThat night of his seizure, I thought he was going to die. I didn't know if he would ever start to breathe properly again. I feared what that seizure could have done to his brain, and I thought the person I have loved for so many years might just never wake up. I have flashbacks daily, I have panic attacks every time a sound or a face he makes resembles his seizure. I have nightmares every night, and I often wake up in the middle of the night hearing and seeing him having a seizure, but I'm still half asleep and dreaming.\n\nFor those claiming this is not PTSD, they have not been in our shoes. For anyone claiming we are selfish for having PTSD and needing space to heal ourselves, we are just as human as our partners. In my case, my partner doesn't remember any part of his seizure, so he is not traumatized by it. I have been by his side throughout more than anyone could ever know, but I cannot fully be there for him if I don't do what's needed to take care of myself, and heal.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767734499.0, "id": "ny2x9k6", "author": "Downtown-Ad174"}

I can honestly say that from the circumstances of your story, this is never an easy situation. Situations like this forge us and how we react to the world. \n\nBut if you *hadn't* been there, he likely would have suffocated; the trauma of losing him would be much worse, and yet much different...

The odds of him waking up and not knowing what happened vs not at all are reasonably equal if I am not there. \n\nIn this circumstance, your anxieties are warranted. But it's important to consider that you offered a level of support in his most vulnerable state, that ultimately saved his life. \n\nYou rocked that shit!! \n\nWould it make you feel safer and more prepared to have a couple first aid courses under your belt?

I think my main concern is wanting to be awake to help him immediately and not let me suffer for longer than he has to if that makes sense?\n\n\nHe still lives with his mum as she is his care taker and was taking frequent seizures until he was put on sodium valproate and his bed is really loud and she knows immediately when he’s taking a seizure which I think is why my anxiety isn’t as strong when he’s not with me, but when he is with me i know that i am his sole provider for help if the seizure happens even when I am at his house with his mum there in the next room I find myself dressing in long less “showing” pajamas incase she has to run in, and when he’s with me (i live alone) it takes 30 minutes for his mum to reach me and she has the emergency medication for him and it fills me with anxiety for those instances.\n\n\nI am rambling sorry but I think the suffocation is the part that did scare me the most as the seizure was fairly easy to deal with on my part with knowing what to do and being in an essentially soft furnished room with no hard objects. I just find myself not being able to sleep bc I want to be awake to help him so when he shakes in his sleep it puts me into helping mode but then i realised he’s just sleeping and it becomes a viscous cycle causing me not to sleep which i know is a bad thing for our relationship as he needs me well rested and not bitchy from lack of sleep lol.", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1767387305.0, "id": "nxbiurp", "author": "No_Map_7282"}

It’ll just take some time to calm your nerves- you’re most likely being overly hyper-vigilant at night now whilst he’s sleeping, even if you have always been a light sleeper, now you’ll be on high alert subconsciously as you’re looking out for a literal potential life or death situation occurring next to you at night, with potential precursors being the same twitches or tremors he may have exhibited before the last secure too. \n\nIn the case of myself and my partner, because we’ve been such close friends for so long I was able to push for him to seek further medical treatment when he was resistant (thank fuck he finally agreed) and found that actually being there and talking to the doctors really, really helped my own mental state- not because it put me at ease (the info really didn’t lol) but because the drs were able to talk to me as the person who sleeps beside him with information specific to situations that I was scared I’d be helpless for him in. Things like what to do if he fell out of bed mid seizure, what to do if he hits his head on the side table, what to do if he’s choking in a laying down position etc. It was all helpful to me, because I felt more equipped to be helpful to him in those situations that I’d feared. \n\nYour fears are based in reality- don’t ignore them but don’t allow them to disrupt your life; relationship or sleep- if you take initiative like you’ve done with talking to his mum, and take your time coming to terms with being calm and capable in such situations, you’ll be fine to get a decent nights sleep next to him in no time. \n\nAnother thing you could do to help ease your mind and reduce risk for him is to consider scenarios and engage in risk minimising- like if there is a bedside table, remove anything from it that could be hazardous during a night seizure and make sure any curtain or blind chords etc are pinned away from the bed (should do that regardless of epilepsy).

There are children’s books dedicated to these kinds of topics, so I would find and vet a book (age appropriate) about this and read it to them. Learning through play is also very effective for kids that age, so if you can find games meant for this online that may be a good way to do it too.

I couldn’t even hear my fiancée who was right next to me nor the things that we were watching on tv.\n\nThis sadly however did not protect me from some of the worst noises, some of those explosions were so incredibly loud that I screamed involuntary and had my heart rate going up really high for a few minutes every time. After 2-3 of these big explosions I put some homemade paper roll ear plugs in as well, so at this point we were in an apartment with all windows closed, pillows put up at the windows, playing something on the television, me wearing earplugs as well as over ear headphones blasting ambience at maximum volume and even all that did not protect me from having a couple more PTSD attacks later on anyway, it genuinely sounded like bombs going off at times. \n\nNow to come to my actual question, we did so much to try and protect me from triggering sounds but it seems to have not been enough, I can’t do this again next year, last night was absolute hell, so we’re now brainstorming on what we can do next year around. I considered maybe traveling somewhere else for the night, which would probably work but wouldn’t be cheap, and I would also hate to not be with my loved ones during New Years.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Is it okay not to remember your trauma?", "text": "Hello, I'm currently seeing a Psychiatrist specializing in Gender Affirming care and after communicating between my GP, Psychologist, School and Family and after evaluating my symptoms he has decided to get me on the pathway for some kind of PTSD/Depersonalization disorder. \n\nI was pretty confronted, scared and suprised by this because i don't actually have any memories of a single traumatic event or even series of smaller events that could have led to such a thing. For context my main most prevalent symptom that caused me to see a Psychiatrist in the first place was me having episodes of confusion, disorientation and significant memory issues to the point where it impacts daily life. \n\nThis part was most shocking to me because most of these symptoms have been present as early as i can remember and i thought they were normal, especially the episodes of confusion because i heard that sometimes people get a little bit dazed when they are sick (And i just thought i was sick all the time whenever it happened)\n\nI had a pretty rough time through primary and highschool academically and socially (+ needing to single handedly care for my grandmother with dementia from the age of 10) but i eventually got the grades i needed to enroll into university. In college i developed an eating disorder, tremors in my hands and seizures/jerks and i have terrible gaps in my memory of this time. Months, weeks or sometimes only random days of my life are forgotten and no matter how hard i try i cannot remember. \n\nSorry for all the fluff and a long buildup but my main question to the community: is it okay not to remember? My psychiatrist keeps telling me he needs to \"know what happened\" in that time and what pressumably gave me most of my symptoms but i don't know what to tell him because i genuinely don't remember what happened either. I dont know of he thinks im lying and not ready to talk but i dont know what to tell him or my other health professionals. My GP, Psychologist and Psychiatrist insist they need to know the context of my life during college in order to finalize a disgnosis but I dont have anything to give them because i cant remember. All i can do is describe my symptoms and follow their advice for managing them. \n\nI'm young, living a good life but i don't know how to finalize this diagnosis. I cant ignore it because it effects me too much but i dont know if i can keep visiting these doctors as even with bulk billing its starting to get expensive. \n\nMy state is too small and i've looked around for new doctors but im stuck with who i've got currently. \n\nI feel a bit guilty posting on this sub because nobody actually knows if it's PTSD yet but generally right now im traveling along the disgnosis pipeline for PTSD with all the questionares and etc. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice for me please? Is this a communication issue on my part? Should i find new doctors? \n\nPs: Sorry for any spelling mistakes because of hand tremors/Aussie lingo", "score": 0, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1767275754.0, "id": "1q14qse", "author": "Werewolf_Boyfriend_", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q14qse/is_it_okay_not_to_remember_your_trauma/"}

I also would talk to someone separate who specializes is dissociative disorders. If it is a mental health trauma thing happening then I think someone who understands dissociation would be better for you, not someone just encouraging you to open about stuff you don't even know happened. I think your current provider is actually being reckless by continually saying they need to know what happened to finalize a diagnosis. See someone to help rule out neurological issues and see a new mental health person who will explore the possibility that this is dissociation. It's possible to have trauma you can't remember clearly but even in those situations there's no trying to uncover all the details by a doctor cause that can cause fake memories, it's more about navigating the uncertainty and managing symptoms and getting in tune with your inner mental states.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "I think not remembering is a way your mind/body protects you. As you get to a stable place in life, sometimes your body will release some of the trauma and you will start to remember. This is a fairly common experience and can happen even decades after the actual event.\n\nI’ve wondered the same thing as you, because I was in an abusive relationship for 16 years and I have very little memory of most of that time.  Other people will recall things, and I will have absolutely no recollection of them. But it’s just from that period, I can remember small details that happened after I left with no problem. In my case, as long as it’s not having any negative impact on my life currently, I hope I never remember. I’m sure those memories were just awful ones and serve no purpose for me now. \n\nIf you haven’t actually dealt with the trauma, though, I feel like not remembering can be dangerous. It is really an avoidance technique and may cause you to go on and hurt other people unintentionally because you haven’t faced your own past.

I know I am supposed to be an emotionally safe person for him. I find it difficult to control my emotions and not get upset when it feels like he is constantly blaming me for everything. \n\nHe often tells me he is broken and that he doesn’t know how much he can take. I try to support him, but I do get emotionally overwhelmed quicker and quicker. He takes this as me being unwilling to put effort in and always telling him “no” when he asks me for help. \n\nI love him and want to be there for him. I also have my own mental and physical health to consider PMDD and other problems make the constant intensity really hard for me to handle. I’m trying to find a balance between being supportive and protecting myself, but I keep feeling stuck and unsure what’s healthy. He is constantly telling me that the point we have gotten to now is basically my fault and is on my to repair. To be fair, he has been the main one to always seek to repair our problems. \n\nI don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to read, what to try. I want to stop making things worse. I know I can’t keep handling all of this and he can’t either. I feel like he guilts me and the things he says can be emotionally manipulative, but I do think he genuinely feels the way he says. That he can’t handle more, he feels broken, he feels hopeless, and every time we go down one of these spirals, it’s hard to get back out. He feels tired of being the one to get us back together and repair everything.\n\nPlease be kind to me. \n\nEdit to add: he gets emotionally dysregulated, extreme anxiety, self-isolates, escalates situations quickly to the worst case scenario in his mind. His response to a lot of things is to freeze and not do anything (he doesn’t respond to people’s texts for months, etc.) and he gets very shitty with me and blames things on me like I said.

The trigger is the beer.  Unfortunately you are going to be exposed to situations where there is beer so it might be super helpful to work with a therapist on desensitization of that trigger (alongside your ptsd).  Extreme is the name of the game with PTSD.  I mean - I hyperventilate and start bawling if an emergency response vehicle passes me.  It IS an extreme reaction…but we (often) have the power to desensitize that so that we can live more normal lives.  \n\nThe second issue is your mother.  It is not silly or immature to not want a drink.  Or to want a different drink because of your aversion.  My parents are boomers and I could totally see them doing this - and there have never been alcohol issues in our house.  It would be more in the realm of them shaming over the “ptsd” element than the drink itself.  If I said to them\n“I don’t like beer - I’d prefer to have just the margarita” there wouldn’t be an issue at all.  If I said “beer triggers my ptsd” they would shame and mock me.  So….your mom is being an asshole for trying to belittle and mock you because of the beer. 100%.  But you’ll likely find that if you frame it to others as a STRONG dislike - nobody would even question it.  Should you have to? No.  But we still don’t live in a world where mental health issues are acknowledged and respected…so this is just a way to maneuver so that you don’t have to worry about people being assholes about it.  Nobody can argue about preferences.\n\nThat said - if being in a room with just the smell of beer makes you angry and irritable, truly - therapy is super important…as this trigger rules too much of your life.

They told me they would never leave him alone with her. It bothered and stressed me out all the same.\n\nEventually, they did not visit him, realizing he abused them too, but it was late in their adulthood.\n\n Last year,(they were 52 -yar-old twins), I cut them off due to a collective past of mean behavior and looking down at me (scapegoat in family), ableism, and sexism towards my daughter and me. I really miss seeing my niece. I figure they were old enough to resolve any problems they had,and I wasn't going to put up with any judgemetal behavior anymore.\n\nI tried calling CPS when I was a teen to make sure my sisters were safe as children when I was removed due to abuse. CPS didn't do anything as I had no proof. I had a former CPS worker call as a favor to me, to the school to find out if there was odd behavior. \n\nLater, I learned there was emotional abuse and neglect when they were adults, and it took a long time for them to understand that they were abused and one of them seemed mad at me about it, though I often took responsibility for something being broken that I did not break or do so, my sisters were not punished. \n\nI did want to sue my parents for what they did, but I thought that would just add more trauma, and I feel a bit traumatized when I see a picture of my bio-father, so I thought it was mentally healthy to not sue and keep on going to psychotherapy. \n\nHopefully, your brother knows in the back of his head what happened and won't leave his child alone with your biological father.", "score": 9, "created_utc": 1767205413.0, "id": "nwyd8dg", "author": "pinkbowsandsarcasm"}

At 9 years of age, I had been sleeping in a basement, something I would continue till almost 14 years of age when we moved down south; by that age, I had undergone psychosis shortly after yelling how much I want to commit suicide, and shortly after being given a chef's knife and being told to do it right now. I didn't have any online activity, so I kind of just played by myself on Halo: CE, at one point becoming convinced that all my classmates were secretly coming to play Halo: CE with me where I decided to make them all their own Spartans, complete with their own name and color, the names being those of my classmates. At 12 years of age, he had asked me to get a girlfriend, bring her home and we would have a threesome; I had decided not to obey this order, so I opted to become a weird kid to keep everyone away, and in doing so I had convinced myself that I was doing the right thing, and while I did, I never should have had to make that call. I flipped my eyelids back, picked my nose, and I could always tell myself that I was protecting people from him. Father had also held me and my bro at gunpoint with a real gun shortly before we moved, laughed with his pal as we cried, and ten or so minutes later said it was just a joke. He also ran a puppy mill, but the dogs (German Shepherds) would use the bathroom in the crawlspace in the basement, the place I slept in most often; after piling up for so long, my bro and I were given gas masks, a large flashlight and two garbage bags to clean it all up since we could fit and he couldn't. I also had been made to scrape the puppy pen, that being a place in the house with a cage and cedar chips, and while it was only once, it was enough to kill your sense of smell very shortly, and one time even being tasked to dispose of a stillborn puppy, and I'm pretty sure I could visualize what would happen; I had witnessed a number of instances of animal cruelty over those years.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I aim to help negate the effect people like him have on this world, the only reason we are alive is because he let us know that he would burn us alive after sealing the exits to our home after he got back from work, but my hands are dirty; at twenty-two years of age, my family took in this friend  of my brother's. He would go on to shit in my bed, beat off in it among other things, and when I asked my family to go investigate the smell because it would be a soap opera otherwise, I was told it was all in my head, and soon after experienced intrusive thoughts including gutting the animals and killing my family; I immediately begged to be baker acted, something that had happened three times before, and ended up being in the waiting room with this woman who claimed to have seen me around, but I just waved it off. I had immediately getting more intrusive thoughts, this being of SA; after having dealt with the thoughts for a few days, I threatened her to keep her away from me. I didn't know how to ask for help, I just knew I didn't want to hurt her or anyone, so I threatened her to keep her away from me; I saw it as the only way to protect her from me.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!A few friends know about everything, and they gave me mercy; none of them are guys, but that confuses me more. In fact, I had been given mercy by another person long before them, before I had made such a grave threat; I drew a stick figure pictures of this guy in my class giving a BJ to his friend, and while his friend wasn't impressed, that guy gave me mercy, that it was a good drawing. I wanted him to be mad, so I tried the same thing again, and again the same thing happened; I don't understand why I was given any level of kindness, not from him or anyone else. I had lived a life of violence, made to fight my brother till we bled to entertain father, but I always thought we were just having fun, and now I aim to live a life of pacifism; I drew a lot of blood. Still, to this day, whenever I play a game, do the dishes, anything at all, all I can hear is \"Rape\", and my own threat of the act; really, I would love to die. I can deal with the attacks I had made as a small child, but it's that threat that eats at my mind; I don't know why I didn't know how to ask for help. I was just always stuck in survival mode and unfortunately I have plenty of regrets; I simply hope one day it can all be atoned for.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!The flashbacks can occur at times, my most recent time being not too long ago, maybe a few months; I was doing the dishes, listening to a video about Frutiger Aero when I felt like I was right back at that field with Father holding that gun. For the longest time I thought about what I had to have missed being so disconnected from the outside world; I had TV, but that was it. My friends tell me that I'm not a bad guy, and sometimes I can buy into it, but it's far too often I hear my own threat; I appreciate their kindness, but it all feels so undeserved.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I just always feel like I'm splitting myself in half all the time; even in the movie theatre, I'm always thinking. A moment where I'm awake and not thinking at all is just a blessing. Maybe someone out there can explain this; I can believe my friends when they say I'm not my Father, but it feels like there's always something there to remind me. I am pretty keen on giving others kindness, but I just want to give up on any of my hopes and dreams; it feels like my hands are too dirty to have the right, the only reason I do is because I know that I can turn things around. I can fight the influence people like my Father have on this world, and I actively work towards it, but it feels like that right became invalid when I issued that threat of SA.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!If I may, give your raw opinion, be it that I truly am not worthy of anything good or the same thing my friends have said, but either way, I need to say something and I need answers, and even your own statement is an answer.!&lt;\n\n  \nEdit: sorry, I blurred things wrong.", "score": 13, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767148079.0, "id": "1q01a04", "author": "IShouldntBeHere26", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1q01a04/sorry_to_put_this_here_i_just_need_to_be_heard/"}

My symptoms center around 2 different events, but only one of them is relevant here. When I was 10 years old, me and my parents fought violently over how long I should get to keep my hair. I had grown it out to around waist length at the time because it helped me feel better about my body while I was struggling with gender dysphoria. My parents didn’t approve of me doing this, and after weeks of arguing with me about it they decided they’d had enough. My dad forcibly held me down while my mom chopped off all of my hair. Afterwards, I remember looking at myself in the bathroom mirror with bruises on my arms and my hair completely shorn.\n\nI still feel intense anxiety over having my hair cut or touched. I’m wondering if maybe I should just cut my own hair from now on, even though i’m not very good at it. Once upon a time I even gave myself a buzz cut so as not to worry about it, but I really do like having long hair. I don’t want to give up that part of myself, but it also needs to be trimmed at some point and I don’t know what to do about that.

I was kind of looking like a mix of hobo and serial killer because my hair was untouched for so long.\n\nI tried to look for a great barber in the big city, ended up paying 70$ for the haircut, and it was way too short, and I wanted to cry, and I felt terrible too because growing hair is a slow process so I felt like I ruined my god damn hair.\n\nWhat I found out is that it was a mix of self-hate and self-distrust. There was a part of me that wanted to keep the hair long, and there was a part of me that wanted a short clean cut.\n\nThe best answer that I didnt know at the time was, just do something minimal, tell barber to cut the sides a bit, and barely remove much, just make it look clean. So that all parts of me are happy. And worse case scenario, you can do a new haircut later, thats way less painful than having tk wakt another two years, which is what happened.\n\nAnd I pass my hand trhought the short hair and wanted to cry because it was too short and I didnt like it, and it was now too late, and it felt painful to feel the short hair so stiff because theyre short.\n\nSo\n\nWhat imma say to you first is to not rebel.\n\nYou see, punks, and other types of rebels; theyre not free, theyre just rebels.\n\nAn easier example\n\nLets say you say I like the color white, and I answer well I rebel against you, so my fav color is black\n\nThats a problem, its better to think, well I feel that my favourite color is blue, regardless of you liking white\n\n/\n\nAnyway\n\nIts very clear to me that you need to let your hair grow very long. Also dont cut your own hair its too difficult and it has awful results, youre gonna need to work yourself into being able to go to a hairdresser and tell him to cut almost nothing to keep the ends well trimmed\n\nSo yeah\n\nThe aanswer is gonna be deep self love, and deep trust\n\nand deep introspection into What Feels Good, and that being your Primary Objective\n\nThe trust is gonna come from an Alliance of your fractured parts. You dissociated to ally with your abusive parents, but now youre an adult and these old stories are ruining your life\n\nThe truth is that your parents didnt love you that day. They controlled you. They ruined you. They made you sad. They didnt care ablut you.\n\nAnd today you have these parents internalized, that dont care about you, that makes you sad, that ruins your life.\n\nThats the beginning of self hate, rejecting yourself, to ally with your abusive parents. \n\nChildren that do this are extremely smart, so you will also need to love that part of you that hates you\n\nYou hated yourself TO SURVIVE abusive people, you hated yourself to KEEP being FED CLOTHED and have a place to SLEEP while in the \"care\" of terrible abusive people.\n\nBut your an adult now, you gonn need to learn from the part lf you that hates you, thats gonna show you your true values, and aalso you gonna need to teach that self hating part that they are other parts thaat needs love and be heaard as well and that what its doing is doingmmore harm than good now that youre an adult and you dont need your parents as much", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767143732.0, "id": "nwu3ygd", "author": "ehredditmodsaretoxic"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "PTSD specialist here\n\nWell, people don't have chronic anxiety and stuff for no reason.\n\nIt may help you to understand a few nuances about ptsd\n\nSometimes, ptsd occurs for what did not happen. Children are supposed to be cared for, loved, supported, encouraged. So if one of those things did not happen you can get ptsd. But if you think about it, like for example not being loved by a parent... well it's not something that happened, it's something that did not happen, so its harder to see\n\nAlso ptsd can occur for reasons that sre benign, but it makes the child make subconcious wrong beliefs about the world and it fucks their life later on\n\nAlso everybody has ptsd, so that diagnosis simply cannot be wrong.\n\nAs for a wild guess, anxiety and depression... well I guess maybe child you needed one or many of your caregiver to change something in themselves for you to feel better but they didnt\n\nAs for anxiety... Could be self-hate. Self-hate occurs when a child reject part of themselves to adapt to an abusive parent. \n\nThe child reject supress and disown those internal parts thst are true but are \"not acceptable\" by the parent, so it also comes with a great veil of denial so thats why you may not be able to see it on a first look\n\nSelf hate causes anxiety because there is an 'enemy' inside you that does not seek your best interest, well all parts of you seeks your best interest but sometimes they donit the only way they know still and it comes off abusive and it feels like you have an enemy within, this living like that creates anxiety as if there was someone who could hurt you next to you at all times, but its you, so youre anxious a lot\n\nAnyway youre young its a GREAT time to fix that shit before your adult life its painful process but its so good I wish I did all of what I did way earlier\n\nBut its also a paradox, because if you try to fix yourself, then theres something wrong about you, and now thats baxk to shme and self hate, so its a fine line to love and understand to grow and see different poc", "score": -11, "created_utc": 1767155513.0, "id": "nwv0jud", "author": "ehredditmodsaretoxic"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "I searched for truth\n\nI searched for an answer to my problems, and I could see that many therapists that worked with me, didnt do much of anything, or if it did it didnt stick\n\nAnd I was like, well I kinda did what she told me, and talking to myself I said well look where I am, look how I feel, look that your life isnt that much better\n\nI think they are many problems with finding the truth, for one nobody has it all figured it out. So its not like I can point to a book or a teaching or a video that solves everything\n\nBut I kept on going, for many of years, kind of everyday reslly for a few hours. And every new day id be like ok, I have this problem today, lemme find someone that talks about it\n\nAnd eventually Id come across a specialist, that blew everyone out of the water. \n\nSo I did a lot of cross-referencing too, with my own life and amongst them. So Id think, ok this specialist said this, this other one said that; and this is what I lived in my own life.\n\nAlso, theres this one time, I found the video of a girl on youtube. She was talking about how she got out of sociopathy. And then shed talked about her life back then, when she was a sociopath, and she gave out tiny details about her life and the way she was thinking behaving and reacting.\n\nAnd then it clicked hard, I was like oooooooooh, my mom is a sociopath. I mean I knew she was an evil annoying bitch, I knew she was a narcissist, but thats the video that scealed the deal, and I could confidently\nsay she was. By myself for myself, its very hard to find a meeting of minds for these things, even if you go talk to a therapist or someone at the psych ward. In fact, what I noticed is well, the professionals at the psych ward gets manipulated by manipulators! Wow dude. Talk about their diplomas being nothing else than meaningless papers.\n\nSo I was like, well Im on my own here, nobody but me can ultimately figure it out. Some people help they really do, but its more of a puzzle piece.\n\nSo yeah, cross-referencing, amonsgt different specialists, and amongst your own experiences is what I suggest. Eventually truth starts to emerge. \n\nToday I sometimes watch so called specialist and im like raging and I end it, because I think youre so fucking dumb! and these very people go on talk shows and news spreading their bs. \n\nTBH its very rare that a specialist got it all wrong, its more that theyre a little bit off, or that they assume something, or they label some root cause thats not it. But enough of that it becomes a muddy pool of bs, and theyre just not worth listening too.\n\nSo yeah, at this point I consider myself with a level of knowledge thats way above harvard teachers, which they sound dumb to me for the past 10 years, but I did listen to their courses back then. Theyre just people put there that knows more than they do.\n\nI also think that those psychology subjects are difficult subjects, you have to be careful not to make true what you said, or to delude yourself that what you said is true because you said it. Above all, its just a sensitive subject. People have their own problems, and ways to deal with the world, and priorities. Priorities being an important one, sometimes someone wants to make money, or keep peace with everyone, or please someone, or keep alignement with the social group at any cost, or find approval, or to be right; and these motivations interfer so much with the truth, to the point that they believe themselves and then it becomes a shit show", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767290078.0, "id": "nx413p2", "author": "ehredditmodsaretoxic"}

PTSD sufferers often downplay our own suffering and question whether something was \"bad enough\" so having an objective perspective from a professional could clear it up.

They should be able to tell you, and if they can't then I would strongly reconsider seeing this provider again as PTSD does have criteria for the event causing it in the diagnostic manual and it is critical for discerning PTSD from other disorders that have high symptom overlap. \n\nSince you responded to another comment that you experience flashbacks, you should be able to know what caused the PTSD from the content of the flashbacks assuming they're true flashbacks (some mistakenly believe thinking about an event often or feeling upset when recalling a negative experience is the same thing as a flashback but it's beyond that).", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1767133970.0, "id": "nwta4hs", "author": "fuschiaoctopus"}

He was already an alcoholic and divorced from my mom, plus he liked to berate me for one thing or another, so I guess it was the logical next step, but he hadn't ever done anything physical before so I guess it was kind of what triggered symptoms to start. But ever since it happened, all the stuff that happened to me before that could be considered \"traumatic\" but I didn't consider a big deal before has bothered me.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression/anxiety since I was a little kid (or at least I was going to therapy for it? Don't remember when I was actually diagnosed for sure) because I was being bullied pretty hard and it was around when my parents were divorcing. I thought I was over it though by the time I was in high school. And I had some relationships that didn't go so well, I'm somewhere on the ace spectrum and had some partners that didn't really get it and sometimes pressured me to do stuff I didn't want to do. But none of this really bothered me until my dad. Now I'm constantly thinking about all the horrible things that happened to me before him and keep reliving it all. I feel like I'm being overdramatic about it since it didn't bother me until now, even though logically I know that's not right. And it's affecting my relationships with pretty much everyone in my life. I have a really supportive partner now who tries his best to help me and tells me I'm a good person, never pressures me to do anything I don't want or forces me to talk about stuff when I'm don't feel like it, but even with him I'm just always waiting for him to change his mind. Like he's going to realize that I'll always be fucked up somehow and give up on me. I have nightmares all the time that he has had to deal with the aftermath of and I have all these triggers that sometimes are fine and sometimes will set me off out of nowhere, and I know it's exhausting even if he wouldn't tell me that. It's exhausting for me and I know what's going on in my head, so it's gotta be even more exhausting for him. It's not like he can read my mind and sometimes it's impossible for me to tell him what's wrong out loud.\n\nI'm just sick of being like this and I feel like I'm running out of time before I end up alone. I haven't gotten any better since it happened, if anything I just keep finding more things wrong with me. I'm not going to ever have a normal life again. I'm a different person now and I miss the old me.\n\nIs it normal for things before the event to get more difficult to deal with? I was diagnosed with PTSD but is this what CPTSD is like?

You are not alone!\n\nFor context, I was dating this dude (24M) for two years. He was the sweetest guy, at first we were obsessed with each other; we even moved in together and met each other’s families. The first year was absolutely perfect, then everything changed in 2025. He started being less caring, less helpful, less loving. He was always stressed and tensed up. And this summer I learned why. His mother revealed to me that she hates me and she feels ashamed that her son is dating me, that I am useless and she feels a strong repulsive feeling towards me. \n\nI understand that this type of stress could affect him a lot, and in August I wanted to leave him so his mom could stop being so upset about me. But then it was never the right time to break up. We had tickets booked for Greece in August, then in September university started, October was full of exams and stuff, November was not good either, then now December cause it wouldn’t be fair to break up so close to the holidays, but neither January cause it’s his birthday. So I had to stop making up excuses and start prioritizing myself first. I had lost myself in this relationship, and giving the fact that he had sucked up all my energy and took control over my body, this made me feel anxious. So I broke up with him and I am waiting for him to move out!\n\nHe used to pin me down during fights and that’s not even the worst part. I stopped being aroused by him after that fight with his mother. I just had this performative anxiety overcome me. But he never stopped touching me. \n\nHe never respected my boundaries; I told him that I wasn’t consenting to him touching me, but he kept undressing me and kissing my private parts. Every touch he ever made was sexual. Kissing? Took of my pants. Scratching my back? Taking off my top and pants . He kept touching me when I was sleeping, when I was cooking, every time!!!! I started having panic attacks because he never respected my boundaries. \n\nAnd now that I am talking to someone (please don’t judge me, I have human needs too despite my trauma), I feel like this performative trauma keeps following me. Whenever we get to talk about intimacy and sexual matters, I tend to get this bad anxiety and also flashbacks of my ex touching me all over without consent. Like, I feel horny, and I really wanna have coitus, but I feel really bad and my body shuts down. I can’t even dirty text anymore, because every time I get reminded that having sex means being touched. And I don’t feel comfortable even when I am touched on my waist. \n\nWhat am I supposed to do? :,)) help a girl out", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767111262.0, "id": "1pzm57x", "author": "uwuh3nta1", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1pzm57x/opening_up_about_my_abuser/"}

I had multiple traumas mostly throughout childhood and as becoming an young adult. Ever since I escaped and now I'm safe, I've been feeling disconnected from the world as if everything around me is not real and I'm just in a dream now. It's been 10 years like this.\n\nDue to my recent sleep issues (nightmares of being in the traumatizing situation, screaming in my sleep and having sleep paralysis), I ended up seeking help and managed to find someone who specializes in EMDR. Once I told her what I've been through, she said EMDR would be more helpful than what they originally offered (CBT).\n\nI also mentioned what bothers me the most is my vision. I had been to different opticians and nobody really knew what the problem is. I have a slight astigmatism but nothing major. My eyes just don't want to focus at objects, always just looking through things, no matter how close or far they are. I could be staring into thin air for hours and although it bothers me, my eyes seem to feel good about being lazy if that makes sense?! My therapist said this is a symptom of PTSD (including the dissociation). I'm getting more and more scared now as it seems to be permanent now. I don't notice any changes with EMDR. The sessions always end up being traumatic and just when we think we've covered everything, there are more traumas resurfacing.\nOn my last session we established how I don't remember anything of the 7 years prior to escaping (abusive relationship), none of my birthdays, Christmases or where I even lived). \n\nI also have cognitive issues, I have trouble following conversations or even putting proper sentences together, I feel absolutely dumb, even though I was studying on university level a couple years ago until my most recent trauma. This is where things started to go wrong for me with my thinking. It gradually started to feel more and more dumb, at first I couldn't understand why I can't understand the simplest things, now I just feel absolutely ruined mentally.\n\nAnyone knows if any of these are normal?

Because if I don't love anyone like that, it's not because I can't, but because I have no one to. And those I should have had, like her, only isolated me, neglected me, made me invisible, and harm me non stop for years. \n\nShe still dares to say, from time to time, that \"she loves me even if I don't think so.\" What she loves is the version of me she has to tell herself to keep living her lies and keep avoiding problems. \n\nAnd he dares to say that he has accepted his responsibility. What he has accepted: that he should have taken me to a psychologist sooner, that he shouldn't have allowed what my father did. In other words, the only thing she takes responsibility for is what she has NOT done instead of what she has. \n\nNow she's seeing a psychologist. Finally, a little late after seven years. Unfortunately, she now knows how to justify her emotional incapacity much better than before. Apparently, the psychologist told her that living with me is like living with her enemy. I have endured years of suffering only to conclude that no one is yet able to take responsibility and that I am the \"abuser\" (according to her, I abuse her, her words). And perhaps it's true, because I've lost all the emotional regulation I once had, and the times I've gotten angry I've insulted her a lot and thought she deserved to feel all the pain she's caused me. But I try not to, I try to control myself, and I can't. This is what she caused, and now nothing she caused or her actions exist, only mine exist. She is the victim and doesn't mention when it was the other way around, and I am the abuser and neither the context nor the time when I was the other way around matters. \n\nIt's all so invisible that I feel that part of me will always be trapped in that invisible world. \n\n\n____\n\n\nShe always seems like a little girl. To give you an idea, I don't let her into my therapy sessions, much less alone, because in my adolescence, all my experiences with that kind of thing were that she imposed her own narrative and then the psychologists based their work on that, whatever I said. When the psychologist started to see the real situation, it made them uncomfortable, and they removed me from his practice (two psychologists even told me openly that they made them uncomfortable!), There have been times when she took advantage of MY therapy time, when she was supposed to talk to the psychologist about ME, to have HER own session, leave angry with me, and saying that the psychologist tell her to punish me!!?? (Which was true. Because they only accepted that I had psychologists who did not follow the work ethic) And even in sessions with the psychiatrist, she told me that the side effects of the medication were my perception; the psychiatrist would give me more medication because of HER narrative, and that went on until I got intoxicated TWO times. \n\nAnd that's why I don't trust her and I'm afraid of her entering my therapy room, much less without supervision.  She doesn't like that, and the other day, in a fit of anger, she told me that her psychologist had thought about me going to family therapy, and she had said no because \"If I don't let her in, then she won't let me in either\". WHAT? I don't care about her decision, but she made it as revenge and \"consequences\" for mine, which has a context for which she is responsible, instead of for what is right. She's emotionally inept. The other day he repeated that I was stupid 60 times, just the words \"you're stupid,\" \"you're so stupid,\" over and over, without stopping, without giving me any explanations, just to make me feel bad, which is what I did ((but with explanations and context) and maybe I deserve it, but at least I do it because I can't think straight and I'm trying to fix it!  she's 56 years old!!! Before I lost my abilities because of all this, I had more emotional intelligence and logic than she does, at 14 years old!!!", "score": 2, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767098742.0, "id": "1pzh82t", "author": "shiftcuriosity", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1pzh82t/small_vent/"}

Risk of death, very high, miracle I survived. Firearms and repeated beatings were involved.\n\nAnyway, since then I've completely lost any ability to function properly in the real world, and am largely alive due to video game and alcohol addictions. Yet I keep running into this expectation that what happened to me was \"no Biggie\" and I should've manned up and got over it at this point.\n\nNow plenty of people have PTSD and hold down jobs, well what's different in my case is that I'm extremely paranoid and only speak to two people outside my immediate family. I am absolutely terrified of human contact and also became agoraphobic to a stupid degree, yet another reason why I cannot work regular jobs and am restricted to remote work, even that has it's downsides since I have a lot of trouble managing stress and dealing with people yelling at me (which is common I guess).\n\nI just don't understand why people think it's so easy to just up and recover from this in just a few years, why do they expect me to be normal again and why do they make me feel like my free trial is over and I'm gonna have to pay for every day that I'm not normal?\n\nAround my extended family I'm seen as a weakling who couldn't overcome the hardships god gave me  and became a degenerate alcohol addict that is that way because he didn't accept god and isn't going to church, but thankfully my immediate family is not religeous so you'd think that they'd at least understand right?\n\nNo, they're atheists, Billionaire worshipping meritocratic kind. In some ways they're even worse because they tend to get rather angry at me when I display any of my undesirable behaviour. They try to understand at first but then they usually end up losing their patience with me. \n\nAs for friends only have a couple, and I don't think any of them even get what I'm going through. Sometimes I think that they're just too young for it and haven't seen awful things that happen sometimes.\n\nI get it, things like that happen to the protagonist in the movies and TV shows and they get their shit together quick because they're badass they get their revenge and overcome it while meeting quirky sidekicks along the way.\n\nThat's not how it works in real life though, because this shit is not a fucking joke, it's not some \"character development\".

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Hey OP — I survived a near-death sexual assault a few years ago. The anniversary is actually coming up, marking 5 years since I was assaulted.\n\nIt was not just the assault itself that caused such issues, but how everyone treated me afterwards. The community I was relying on was completely turned against me, and I was left alone. I could never tell my family what happened to me because they are not trustworthy people. Any behavior I had as a result of PTSD (paranoia, ‘toughing it out’, and aggression) were used as reasons why I was not a good person and deserved leaving. A narrative was built that I was exploitative, ungrateful and cruel. I don’t think I was, I think even when I was acting unfairly, it is because I was scared. A former friend said about me that, “It doesn’t matter what she’s been through, how she behaves is her own problem and responsibility.” This was not even half a year after I had been raped. My supposed ‘awful behavior’ was never confronted, I just realized on my own birthday that I had been left alone. The terrible realization that I had potentially invested in the wrong people, or that all people may be like this, was so overwhelming I had a psychotic episode later that year and had to commit myself to hospital because I was a suicide risk.\n\nMy stress-management is completely shot in half; I don’t deal with things normally. I think this assault and fallout has overall caused me to free-fall through these past few years in ways I don’t know if I can comprehend.\n\nSo, in summation, I understand you, and your bitterness towards the world and others. The unfortunate truth is when you get victimized, a lot of more covert (and insecure) people in your life will start to abuse or hurt you as well. I hypothesize that it’s because, subconsciously, they now know you are capable of being harmed. Therefore, you can be situated at the bottom of the proverbial totem pole to elevate themselves. There are so many insecure people in the world, and they look for any excuse to kick others while they’re down to situate themselves as better. \n\nNow onto the good news: Not everyone is like this. As a person who has beeb deeply betrayed, I have come to realize that this is just life, and not everyone sucks like that. And even if they do betray you, the fault is with them. Not you. \n\nAnd onto even better news: PTSD is highly responsive to treatment. EMDR for example has been lauded as a breakthrough therapy. People who invest in treatment plans usually have great recoveries. Affordability and availability is another task entirely.\n\nI can tell you that even beginning to ASK for therapy was such a monumental moment in my life. I was terrified and grew up with a lot of shame in my community and family around therapy, so giving myself permission to be vulnerable like that was huge. \n\nGive yourself permission to be hurt. There’s a delicate piece of your soul that is hurting, we all have it. It’s ok. Everyone here will tell you it is ok. The decision to step into a new version of yourself and start healing is completely in your power — no one can take this from you.\n\nFuck those unsupportive and fucked up people in your life.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Hey man! I' am older then you but I have experienced a lot of the same things you talk about. Just for background I was homeless in my late teens and early 20's, till I was arrested and suffered a lot of abuse at the hands of deputies and most of all correctional officers (I have witnessed them kill people/beat them to death for simply saying or looking at them the wrong way). I still suffer from extremely violent nightmares every night and wake up every 2 hours typically almost in tears and terrified to return to sleep.\n\nWhat I've done to help with some of these issues is try and limit my engagement with social media/news agencies/etc. I also started taking walks every day with my girlfriend which helps a great deal. I think without her I probably would be in very very bad shape. Also I used to be addicted to heroin and began a methadone treatment program and receiving regular therapy which also helped by leaps and bounds.\n\nMaybe you could ask someone close to you to simply take you out once a week, then increase those outings as your mind allows and you feel comfortable. Also seeing a therapist who can teach you coping mechanisms like they taught me could probably help you a great deal.\n\nThe biggest hurdle for you is probably your reliance on alcohol to help treat this symptoms has you in this perpetual cycle of it being a shitty band-aid and then having to constantly \"reapply that band-aid\" more and more as your tolerance to a substance grows, when then creates adverse side effects because you have to do more of the substance to get the same effect. But adding more alcohol to anything rarely makes someone fun to be around regularly.\n\nI feel I know fairly well what you are going through and dealing with and I think dealing with the alcohol abuse would be number one on your list, and then finding better coping mechinisms to replace the alcohol so you can sustain your own mental health without needing chemicals constantly doused on your brain just to feel you can function.\n\nSubstance abuse also reinforces negative behaviors like manipulation, playing the victim, isolating behavior, etc.\n\nIm not saying you do any of these things or exhibit all these behaviors. This is just my experience and opinion as someone who has suffered these same traumas and dealt with them with substances as well. Also I' m a former drug treatment 'councilor' and if you ever want to talk I obviously dont offer legitmate medical advice but I'd be more then happy to listen and give you feedback based on my own experiences.\n\n  \nGood luck out there!

I'm on a wait-list now and told maybe in about a month. I recommend you try this if you can find a good program and someone who specializes in EMDR for PTSD.\n\nI will warn you it's REALLY difficult and important to find an empathetic counselor. For example, mine was about a 30 minute drive away. Therapy, especially EMDR is so triggering, that I'm incapacitated for the fear of driving to it or back home. I had a program once that offered bus service, but I was triggered so badly after one appointment that I couldn't make myself get on the bus and instead walked miles in severe weather to get home. They have something now where they can get an Uber for me when I make it through the wait-list.\n\nTry seeing if they have services like this in your area. The EMDR was so difficult, but after I recovered from each session, I could see the positive impact it had on my day-to-day. I was able to more effectively avoid triggers by making better life decisions, and to put a brief pause on episodes to remove myself from situations before I had a full blown attack.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "score": 7, "created_utc": 1767127206.0, "id": "nwsmikg", "author": "LivingFirst1185"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Most people, by definition, will never get it. The intensity of trauma can be observed as a bell curve. A small privileged minority never experienced any, a bit larger minority experienced small negligent amounts, most people are somewhere around the middle where they did experience some mildly messed up stuff but are still functional, then we go further to the right where you have a larger minority of people who went through some heavy stuff which impedes them from living like the previous types. After that you have the small minority who went through real grouesome shit which incapacitates you completely - that's probably where you find yourself. Everybody who is to the left of your position on the bellcurve will never understand you, thank God they won't. I know you're frustrated but I also know you agree that you would never wish this stuff upon any other being.\n\nPeople will constantly get triggered by your damage because on a deep unconscious levels it sets off their self preservation instincts. They literally can't help feeling uncomfortable and projecting nasty shit onto you. They get afraid and reactive because you signal what's a possibility for anyone. Nobody is guaranteed a safe ride through life but everybody likes pretending that they are guaranteed one. Truth hurts, most avoid it. You can't avoid it because you're staring it dead in the eye every single day.\n\n\"That's not how it works in real life though, because this shit is not a fucking joke, it's not some \"character development\". It's simply damage for the sake of damage that will never go away, you can treat it, make it easier on yourself but it will never go away, you will be afraid of fireworks, you will be getting panic attacks and jump into fight or flight mode when particularly aggressive gentlemen yell at you and you will suffer through it whether you want to or not.\"\n\nYou're right, it is not a joke. This shit is real, as real as it gets. People have no clue. However, I'm happy to say that you're not necessarily stuck with the damage. That's a common narrative in our society because most people (because of the bell curve) do not have the competence, emotional intelligence, understanding, compassion or skillset to help the mega fucked up types. Then in order to preserve their self image as highly competent professionals they claim that these things can not be healed and that coping and managing is the best thing that survivors of high level trauma can do. That's 100% absolute bullshit. \n\nI know it seems unbelievable from the current place of darkness and paranoia and sensitivity and everything but it's completely doable. It's not easy, there are plenty of times when it's gruesome to the point you think you're gonna go insane from it but it is definitely doable. Full healing is possible. The thing that continuously stops you from believing it is that you run into nothing but lack of understanding in life. That's a huge part of the reason why you're at the point that you're avoiding people. You give up once you realize that nobody gets it and nobody really gives a shit. Just small correction - almost nobody. Having a single person who really gets it, who feels you can be a huge help to get the realization that you truly are not damaged for life. Finding such a person isn't guaranteed. There's not many of them but they exist.\n\nI know you already know this but the first step is overcoming the video game and alcohol addictions. I know you're aware of it because you explicitly stated that you're addicted to that stuff. Most people who stay trapped in such coping mechanisms never admit that they're coping mechanisms. You have enough awareness and self honesty about your entire situation. Do whatever you can to get better every day in the tiniest steps possible. Agoraphobia is quite a beast as well. It sort of creeps up on you. You just wake up one day and realize that you don't feel comfortable anywhere anymore and that leaving the front door seems like going to war. Once again, small consistent steps. If your windows are constantly closed, start by opening them so that you blur the boundaries between \"indoors\" and \"outdoors\". Spend more time leaning on the window or on the balcony. Go for silly little walks around the block. Go to the supermarket and just stay there much longer than you need to. These are not full fledged solutions for the anxiety and paranoia because those are rooted much deeper and need a felt out somatic solution but they're a great start. Plenty of people go to all kinds of events even though they feel very uncomfortable. They may not feel your amount of anxiety and paranoia but the point I'm trying to make is that you don't have to feel okay or non damaged in order to appear out in the world. Nobody gives a shit about you anyway, remember?\n\nWishing you the best of luck, you got this. Step by step.", "score": 9, "created_utc": 1767111816.0, "id": "nwr3uwf", "author": "CasuallyPeaking"}

I literally couldn't do anything, I felt like I was going insane and due to the dissociation also just watching myself go insane like some sort of incredibly fucked up dream where I was constantly terrified. I share an apartment with my sister and at one point her friend came to the door unexpectedly to drop something off when I was alone and I totally lost it, somehow ended up cramming myself into this little cabinet in my closet with a canister of bear spray I had and was simultaneously convinced I was reliving the traumatic event and about to relive it and in mortal danger. To this day I don't know how I even managed to fit in that cabinet lmfao \n\n It also really affected my cognitive processing speed and ability and I ended up dropping out of college and quitting my job for a bit and quite literally the only reason I didn't end up homeless was because I was fortunate enough to have family that could and were willing to support me. \n\nso basically 0/10 wouldn't reccomend, but things are slowly getting better.

The professionals saw ptsd in you.\n\nMy whole life people have told me my reactions are \"dramatic\" or \"pathetic\" but most mental health professionals check out when I try to disclose even a small amount of what happened or answer direct questions. Its not even that awful on paper, its the sustained harm that is the real wound. No more- not for me, not for you. \n\nYou pain matters, your wound matters.

They put me on trazadone as it had worked before but this time it brought me such vivid nightmares I could remember and feel where I had been shot, stabbed, bitten, or one time the agonizing grief of watching the plane my mother was on crash in front of me(it was a dream, shes still here thankfully) but I just wish I could BE HERE for everyone and just be here presently.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Self Defense", "text": "I signed up for some self defense classes. Privately. I didn't wanna deal with other people and being in a group. Too social for me (not for PTSD related reasons).\n\nEventually, the classes turned into MMA/muay thai/boxing/kick boxing fighting classes (but without the rules), so that I knew what to do in a street fight. Aka, gouge people's eyes out, kick men in the balls whenever you can, etc. \n\nThe thing is, I never told my trainer I was... well... r-worded (don't like sayind the word out loud, don't like typing it either, I've said it in a few comments and just thinking about it makes me wanna throw up so excuse me for censoring. I really am against censoring words but this is just a personal preference.)\n\nAnyway, it's been more than a year now so I've been once again laarning how to \"take it\", as in be punchned while I'm in defence (aka my semi fists are \"glued\" to my face, protecting my chin, the main kock-out weak spot), and my trainer hits me with his boxing gloves right on top of my fists, resulting in me feeling the impact on my cheeks and face and getting a buinch of face bruises.\n\nI don't mind getting bruises. I'm a tough gal. What made me write this post is that the moment the \"learning to take it\" exercise was done, my eyes teared up. I stared at the ceiling, tried to blink it away, but I couldn't. My trainer saw. He was trying to be encouraging and all, saying how we all react different to stress situations but I'm not sure he knows what I felt. I didn't even know what I felt until a couple of days later and lots of thinking about it.\n\nWhen he punches me \"normally\", I'm fine, but when the strength exceeds a certain unmeasured threshold, I lose my shit. I'm composed and strong, keeping my ground while \"in the fight\", but the moment it's over, I break. \n\nIt's like, I know he isn't even using half of his strength when he punches me \"hard\". If he ever used full strength on me, I'd literally die. Not figureatively - LITERALLY. I know he's dealt with women like me before so I trust him completely, but I still feel this... icky feeling, this residual fear reminding me of the past experiences i'm trying so hard to forget. \n\nThe fact that a man can overpower me so eaily makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable and dare I say, scared. I'm not big, I'm small, you could probably hold both my wrists with one hand. I've gained muscle throughout my training, I can land a good punch, but I'll never compare to a man.\n\nIt'll always be so easy for a random dude, not even one who's training, to overpower me. That's terrifying to me. It's making me feel small, vulnerable, helpless. Like a damsel in distress, waiting for someone to save her. Well, no! I don't wanna be that. But sometimes being punched hard in the face brings me right back to it. \n\nThank fuck I have a therapy session to unload all that tomorrow becasue I honestly don't know what to do with myself anymore.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "TW: Brief mentions of CSA, Firearms assaults.\n\nThis may be bad advice but it is also something that has helped me. I am a male person but I have experienced a lot of CSA that is still ever-present in my mind today. The feeling of being overpowered like you mentioned is also something that I constantly fear and also takes over my body sometimes. For me something that helps that feeling is carrying some form of weapon, where legal, to help even out any physical disparities that might occur. This could be something as small as a heavy ring or options that escalate to pepper spray, kubotans, pocket knives, firearms, etc. These options are not the best fit for everyone, and training should be had to use any of them, but any form of weapon could be used to equalize or have greater defensive power than an opponent. I am also mentioning this because you obviously have taken a lot of time to train and that means that you seem to be taking this seriously and it seems to be something you are doing to help yourself live more normally. For me having some sort of weapon with training is something that helps me live normally in a world that can feel dangerous. \n\nAs an example some of my experiences involved my perpetrator using firearms against me. This led to a lot of fear and a more extreme form of the feeling of being overpowered or not being able to stop what was happening. As an adult I became more interested in firearms and learned all about them. I overcame the fear I had of them. I am now a firearms instructor as a hobby. In my experience a firearm (or any other weapon) can be used both by perpetrators to do harm and by others to prevent harm or being overpowered physically. I will also say that your basic pepper spray is much more usable in 90% of situations and it is more easily carried in lots of areas. Obviously I understand if you have other reasons for not looking into a force multiplier. everyone's journey is individual and things don't work the same for a lot of us. I hope you find a way to help you overcome this feeling of being overpowered.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "I'm convinced that I'm faking, although I have been diagnosed(TW: abuse mention)", "text": "I'm writing this at 1am and spiraling, please bear with the mistakes and rambling.\n\nYou guys hate HATE it when people fake trauma or throw around words like 'PTSD' and 'trigger' lightly, right? \n \nWell, you should all hate and step on and spit on me too, because I'm one of those filthy ugly narcissistic attention seeking fakers who never had any real suffering, not for even a second. I'm a disgusting vile attention whore. A dirty fat selfish piggy that only cares about what goes into its mouth.\n  \nThe reasons I think I'm faking:\n \n1. Delayed trigger response\n\nThey used to be instant. In the past, I would start sweating and my hands would shake uncontrollably whenever something that reminded me of That happened. \n \nBut now my responses are delayed. Like being fine outwards/dissociating when it's happening but feeling exhausted and nauseous one or two hours later to the point where all I can do is curl up and go blank, refusing to respond and jumping at footsteps. It's probably me faking it for attention, right?\n\n2. Emotionally blunt\n \nI'm very emotionally blunt. I don't remember ever screaming in terror in my life, even if the situation was objectively terrifying.\n \nAnything they did to me back then(not SA), I let them do, pretending I was a doll or some other lifeless object. I retreated into myself and shut down fully until they were done. I gave up on trying to run or escape because I knew they were faster, stronger, and would catch me and punish me more for it. I learned to ignore some of the pain and stay silent, ignore all my emotions until I couldn't feel them anymore.\n \nAs for 'flashbacks' and 'episodes'...\nI'm not sure if they can even be called that.\n \nI experience nothing visual, no full on vivid reliving hallucinations flashing before your eyes, being in that moment 100% with all your senses and being unable to distinguish it from reality like most, not if all the people here experience daily.\n \nSometimes my brain gets 'convinced' that I am back there and I should get out NOW, but I can still see and hear reality, I don't get overtaken by visions. So that's surely not a real flashback.\n \nOnly feelings of panic and dread, little or no memories attached because my dumb worthless brain decided to forget 90% of my childhood and teenage years while the 'abuse' was ongoing.\n \n'PTSD episodes'...I might dissociate, curl up, feel exhausted with my heart pounding and stare blankly at the wall feeling nauseous, but I don't have seizures or thrash around or get transported INTO that moment exactly or cry and scream for hours afterwards. I don't really suffer like you guys. I'm probably faking all of it too, overreacting.\n\nI don't scream or cry or full on hyperventilate or panic, just dissociate and go numb for hours, my heart rate might go up but that's it.\n \nI might punch a wall until my knuckles are bloody and I might harm myself in other ways but I don't scream in terror or cry or actually express any kind of emotion on my face.\n \nBut the weird thing is I still feel like a whole different person in these 'episodes.'\n  \nI look back on it later and wonder what I was thinking to act so weak and stupid and dissociated like that. I'm usually an introverted but funny person who laughs at most things but during those times it feels like I'm fully consumed by despair and pain and I'm not myself anymore, can't think about any jokes either.\n \nDuring that I hate looking in the mirror, because I see my parents' faces in the reflection and I want nothing more than to smash it and slit my throat with the shards.\n  \nAnd yes...I do feel like throwing up after therapy and talking about recalled memories but that's probably a normal human thing and I'm just looking for attention and validation.\n\n3. I still live with the people that traumatized me\n \nSo it can't be THAT bad, right? They hardly hurt me anymore. They said they had no ill intentions and what they did was for my own good. They're my parents, so they know better. I'm just overreacting.\n\n4. I don't wake up screaming and sweating from nightmares every single night\n \nYes, some of the dreams could be classified as 'terrifying,' like being chased down by armed people or getting killed or killing myself. But I barely have any emotional reaction to those. I don't wake up screaming at the top of my lungs or cry or hyperventilate or panic or feel like I'm about to die. I don't wake up every night 10 times with self inflicted wounds on my body. \n \nSometimes, rarely, I do wake up in cold sweat but I can't remember anything anyways so it was probably nothing and I'm exaggerating even now as I type this.\n \nYes, I do have some recurring dreams.\n \nBut in that recurring dream, my original fear gets replaced by anger. There's still some fear, but in those dreams I go batshit insane, berserk, so mad that I try to straight up brutally murder my abusers with my bare hands.\n \nIn 'normal' dreams of normal life, I act accordingly with suitable emotions. But in dreams where my life is in danger or I am being 'abused' like back then, I shut down or dissociate. Or just go insane with rage.\n \nI've numbed myself further, I'm never vocal, even if I'm yelling my head off in rage or frozen in terror in the dreams I don't make a sound in real life.\n \nWas it even 'trauma'?\n \nYeah I thought I was gonna die a few times but that's that.\n \nI slept with a sharpened pencil during childhood because I was convinced my abusers would go too far and kill me one day but that's normal paranoid edgy child behavior, right?\n \nI wanted to kill them. My abusers. I wanted to murder them in the most violent way, and I would have done it if only I could, if I was strong enough. Then I would have killed myself too.\n \nMaybe I'm not 'traumatized' and I'm just a natural psycho who thinks of killing people as soon as they wrong me.\n \nSometimes I consider going off all of my meds to see what would happen, if I can be valid in my suffering, if my previous symptoms would return.\n \nMaybe I'm just a dumb fuck that should kill itself. I used to be smart as a kid but now it feels like my brain is irreversibly turned to mush and I can't even think straight.\n \nI can function, but I feel like I shouldn't be able to.\n \nI feel like I'm exaggerating all my 'symptoms' if they can even be called that.\n\nRant over.\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767025992.0, "id": "1pyqtu0", "author": "MountainNo2895", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1pyqtu0/im_convinced_that_im_faking_although_i_have_been/"}

I see you having a lot of negative thoughts about yourself that were probably first told to you by your abusers. Part of the abuse is that they made it safer for you to agree with them and believe their negative messages than to disagree and be further attacked. It is protective, in a way, to fall into line as it can lessen their outward hostility but agreeing with them erodes your self worth and that is what they want. It is important to explore the possibility that they are wrong about you and find some small private place in your mind where you can put your positive thoughts about yourself.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "How a Combat Veteran Beat PTSD", "text": "Ryan Landry came back from Afghanistan different. Although he didnt recognize it, his experiences as an artillery Sgt would change him. He got out of the Army and joined law enforcement to keep serving. \n\nHis condition got worse as he started seeing similarities in high stress situations. He started drinking more. He was distant from his family. He was hypervigilant, popping awake hearing any noise in his house at night. But worst of all were the flashbacks from gunfights, funerals, snapping to instant alertness as his combat tour came back to him. \n\nRyan outlined the gradual decline in his mental health in his book This Is My Camo. Here are the four things that he did to recover: \n\n1. Recognized and asked for help - Once his wife started showing concern, he realized that he was going to lose his family if he didn't take action \n\n2. Signed up for therapy - Regular therapy sessions helped him to unwind and open up about things that were bothering him \n\n3. Focused on 1:1 family time - Ryan's daughter was born after he got home and he realized that he needed to connect more. He started planning more 1:1 time with his wife and talked to family members, not at them \n\n4. Found purpose - Ryan ended up starting a very popular podcast and got involved with veteran non profits to help raise money for other vets affected by PTSD \n\nThe point of this post is that if you have PTSD and find yourself gripped with terror or other physiological effects, recognize the signs and create a plan for healing. \n\nPTSD can be assuaged with numerous techniques: Equine therapy, counseling, group camping, etc. \n\nHope this helps!

It means you may have been exposed to actual danger or perceived danger. If a person mugs you and you only find out later than his gun was fake, you can still get PTSD from it because you perceived the threat as being genuine.\n\nEDIT: Another example would be childhood emotional neglect. When a child grows up being ignored, never hugged, never shown affection or care - the child instinctual registers this treatment as life threatening. And the child is NOT incorrect in perceiving it this way. For the majority of human evolution if your mom didnt act like she loved you (if she didnt hug you or make eye contact with you) - there was a good chance she was going to abandon you in the cold and you would die. Children in this situation percieve the lack of love as a true danger to their survival. Even in modern times its a danger. If your mom neglects or emotionally abuses you, you could end up in foster care or you could end up homeless or abandoned.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "In fact it does not leave those things out. Everything you listed is included.\n\nVerbal, emotional abuse and neglect of children are veiled threats of violence or implied threats of violence.\n\nParents might never outright say they will hurt you, but the message is very clear for kids under 18: if your parents dont love you, you can end up homeless or dead on the streets. Being loved (or unloved) by a parent is certainly a matter of life or death for minors. Without a parent to help a child survive, they face certain death/violence/danger. If your parent hates you enough you might end up in foster care where you could be subject to even more violence. Or your might end up homeless on the streets where violence is everywhere. \n\nThis is the actual reason why emotional abuse/negelct etc causes PTSD. If a parent neglects a child and simply never hugs a child - this is not lost on the child whatsoever. Children know on an instinctual level that to be accepted and loved by their parent is imperative for their own survival. What is a 5 year old going to do if their mom doesnt love them? Leave and get their own apartment and job and start feeding themselves? No. Children perceive a lack of love/nurturing as a true danger to their lives because **for the majority of human evolution if your mom didnt love and take care of you - you were as good as dead.** And sadly even in modern times children do end up dead from child abuse still. So emotional abuse/verbal abuse and neglect fit easily into this definition for PTSD. They are perceived or actual threats.\n\nMedical trauma this fits very easily into the definition as well. Its not difficult to imagine how an incompetent doctor could potentially kill or seriously injury a patient.

I forgot about it for a long time. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I was literally afraid of babies and toddlers. Like if one was around me, instead of the cute response, my eyes would start watering and I wanted to pull my hair out and scream, and nobody understood why, I was just made fun of for it. My parents treated me like a freak devil child instead of letting me go to therapy. \n\nI personally don't get how these criminals have never been tried. I wonder about how many victims there are, and how I even was put in that position at that age. Was somebody paid to put me in that position? Were they blackmailed to avoid jail time for a crime, and I was some sort of payment for my literal parent to avoid incarceration? Was it one of my parents doing it for free, just because they hated that I was brought into this world, as an accident child? Or just because they were a deranged deviant? \n\nI developed some anger issues from the untreated trauma and stuff, and because I was fat for my age so that was ANOTHER reason I couldn't fit in with my peers, and I was an untreated narcoleptic, and my family was cruel and would just leave me passed out in random places, for me to wake up alone, wondering how the hell it went from me participating in a conversation to POOF waking up alone on the floor. \n\nWell then everybody REALLY locked in about deeming me a devil child, so I switched up by becoming a huge people pleaser. \n\nEverybody thought they could get away with anything with me. Like I just don't UNDERSTAND what makes people have the gall. I have a lot of things I suppress. I smile and wave through some BULLSHIT, and it's the people that HAVE reliable families, that HAVE money that try to fuck with me for fun. Because I'm a good doggy I'll sit there and take it, right? Then when I have had enough, and I clap back, I'M THE BAD GUY?????\n\nOh the pain lmao. I get told I look like a librarian cat lady. My pain doesn't matter apparently because I'm a woman, so I \"have it easy.\" I think the bubbly exterior I try to potray is to mask my sadness and despair, but THAT bubbly exterior is the reason people want to take advantage of me, while my trauma is the reason people want to leave me???????\n\nI want to leave this world sometimes. I genuinely do. I don't understand how people are stupid like this. I thought I was PEAK stupid, but this stuff??? I don't have a SINGLE PERSON I can rely on, being narcoleptic, trapped in a high rent state with low wages, having PTSD, oh and BY THE WAY IT'S RANKED LIKE -2 for dating, because so many people here are WEIRD AND INSULAR, AND FUCKING RACIST AND SPARSE. ALL MY FRIENDS ARE AT LEAST A 2 HOUR DRIVE AWAY. AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO BURDEN THEM WITH MY PRESENCE.\n\nBut I want to put a dent into the cause before I die. Like if it becomes apparent that I can't ever get a man who understands me, I def want to exit this planet at fast as possible. But to do that, I need to take these disgusting ped0s down. I don't feel comfortable living in the same world as them. I really want to meet a like minded person who just says \"NO!\" to that happening. Instead most people just wish you wouldn't exist, because you are interrupting their Disney existance. BIG SIGH\n\nAlso does anybody else have trouble dating Disney adults??? My life is like \"welcome to a hellish truth\" and I get used by these Disney adults with MONEY AND HOUSING and they are UNABLE TO CONFRONT REALITY. Disney adults want to take me for a ride and then CRY when I say their actions are out of line??? YOU HAVE EVERYTHING. MONEY, A FAMILY. YOU MAY HAVE TRAUMA AND BLAH BLAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? I HAVE TRAUMA THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A RICO CASE WASN'T OPENED FOR. I CAN BARELY AFFORD TO LIVE BY MYSELF ANYMORE. I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY. \n\nSTILLLLLLL!!!!? PEOPLE SEE ME AS A LIBRARIAN CAT LADY TO TAKE OUT THEIR ANGER ON??? LIKE I HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH. I AM CONSIDERED CONVENTIONALLY ATTRACTIVE, BUT IDK IF IT'S BC MY HAIR IS BROWN, I'M A PUSHOVER, I'M RELIGIOUS, THEY LITERALLY TREAT ME LIKE THEY EXPECT NO HEAT. THEN WHEN I CLAP BACK I'M PUNISHED.

I started having bad flashbacks and nightmares when i was sectioned into a shit ward I've been to before, and i was assaulted by a staff member. I was in a toxic friend group who didn't understand my bpd, and they made me feel like i didn't deserve to live. Instead of texting me that they couldn't handle my outburts anymore, they blocked me on everything and never contacted me again. This happened when I was forced into the ward were I was assualted. It was so traumatic.\n\nThankfully, reporting the incident with the help of my therapist made the flashbacks and most of the nightmares about the ward go away, but i still have flashbacks and very bad nightmares about my friend (who i was inlove with) abandoning me after he grew tired of my worsening mental health. It hurts so much because he was very understanding in the beginning. The others in the group weren't and the general toxicness made me worse and worse. I couldn't see that until I was no longer in the group and I made new friends. They are lovely and they said I can vent to them if I need, but i feel scared to do so, just incase they leave me like my other friends did. \n\nDoes anyone know how to deal with nightmares? Ive gotten the hang of distraction techniques for the flashbacks thankfully, but the nightmares are on and off. Talking about the past in therapy has really helped, but sometimes I'll wake up sobbing for so long.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": 1767006244.0, "id": "1pyjkac", "author": "Kurapikabestboi", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1pyjkac/any_tips_to_deal_with_ptsd_nightmares/"}

The other one came back over and sent his partner out while he explained to me, calmly, why it was important my legs don't slide off. One of the nurses had to explain to me a few times why I was there, because I was having panic attacks and couldn't remember all the tests they had to do, she was calm, clear, and didn't make me feel stupid for asking for clarification.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF AN ADVERSARY! I can’t stress that enough. If you’re confrontational in any way to someone in a flashback you give them a reason for the threat response going on in their body that further binds them to their dissociation. It’s dangerous because it escalates things and you need to be doing the opposite of that. \n\nAsk direct questions. When people act like they know what’s going on or make assumptions it leads to further feelings of isolation and can contribute to delusions. Ask what’s going on with them, what are they feeling, are they here with you or do they feel stuck somewhere else, etc. it took nine years of treatment with multiple providers and multiple legal proceedings directly related to my flashbacks for a single person to ask me what I was feeling, apart from during my diagnosis and evaluations. I had given up trying to explain because everyone gets uncomfortable and acts like there’s no need for me to say anything, so they never got accurate feedback for treatment issues. Be direct. Be kind. Listen when they talk. \n\nIf law enforcement is involved already, keep them unseen or nearby if they must be present. Prevent them from investigating for violations, like possession or resisting. If they are not involved, do not involve them. I am speaking for combat veterans specifically, but in all reality it applies across the board. Police are not there to deescalate, they are there to protect public safety. Being looked at as a threat by the people with guns and zero accountability is an insult that makes the threat real. We protected ourselves in war zones, we do not need police acting like they’re projecting us or anyone from us and escalating the situation. Their priority is not the best interest of the patient, at least not the foremost priority, and that is fact. Showing up with a loaded weapon isn’t signaling that you’re there to relax and soothe someone in an elevated state or flashback. In many instances, police are part of a broader delusion. Keep police presence to a minimum. If police must approach and intervene, consider unloading or leaving behind your pistol for the approach, particularly if there are more than one of you. In a flashback you are in a combat zone reality, combatants are combatants. Police uniforms can be stolen. Just because you think you look like a cop doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still identify as one and be as cool as possible. You will get cooperation if you do not try to impose your will with a loaded gun at your hip. To us, it’s a direct and obvious threat that justifies the elevated state. Keeping a weapon out of the mix entirely if you have to go hands on is best for everyone and would prevent so many possible negative outcomes. \n\nDo not treat them like a drunk, crazy person, or go along with delusions or confusing statements in any misleading way. Be honest. They are dissociated and agitated for reasons you cannot know or understand, but the reasoning part of the mind is still there. It’s not like dealing with a schizophrenic. If they tell you something, listen to what they are saying instead of discounting it. Being ignored while being communicative with what is being experienced is triggering in itself and can escalate perceptions of persecution or conspiracy. I’ve had deputies not identify themselves, say they were there for a mental health call, ask for identification, or listen to my repeated clear protests to their entering private property before putting hands on me and beating me into the back seat of a cruiser while in a flashback. I was not dissociated when they arrived. Anyone would be agitated if they felt victimized by arms law enforcement, nevermind someone trained enough to become a major problem for them who has to just take the beating to avoid hurting anyone and being charged for defending themselves. You are dealing with people in a fight or flight mode malfunction. They will not respond to pain compliance, threats, or dominance and control. They are fighting for their lives and already have before, you are at work. You need to give space, recognize when you’re not going to soothe a situation or “win” by force, and respect the experience of the person that you know absolutely nothing about but recognize the danger of simultaneously by your actions. \n\nEvery time officers have taken me by force and I have to explain to them my concern is their safety and I need to relax only to be ignored and taken anyway, a piece of me dies inside for not being able to tell them all I’m consciously having to restrain every instinct I have and my sense of identity to not neutralize a threat I did not create. In that state, where you feel your life is on the line, there is no future beyond the next action. Contribute to the immediate future what you want to see and you can steer the unfolding situation to a safe and beneficial resolution. \n\nThere are two sides when first responders show up. That allows for conflict. The sooner they can convince the person they are on the same side and not opponents through their words and actions the sooner the situation improves. \n\nIn summary, at least with veterans, appreciate that there is potential for complications only if you bring that energy into the situation. Be an ally, establish why you are there and that you are not a threat. Be self aware, if there is a swat team on site you’re not exactly part of the treatment team. They are stuck in fight or flight, in two places in time at the same time, but are capable of communicating if you are direct and don’t act as if you already know what’s going on with them. That can reinforce dangerous delusions. Be polite, be gentle, appreciate they are letting you put hands on if you have to, there’s no need to be excessive and add more trauma and alienation to an isolating condition. They need to come back to a grounded state in the present moment. That’s impossible with the perception of a threat present. Give space, communicate directly, and attempt to mitigate their perception of threat with the understanding that they’re dissociated, not broken from reality in the way other patients may be who act similarly. The difference is important. One needs medication to remain lucid, the other remains lucid even when dissociated. They know what you’re doing to them and can’t convey what it’s like from their perspective. Certainly not if you do not ask. \n\nFear, control, and threatening posturing of any sort are part of the problem.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Trauma resurfacing feels like insanity", "text": "Earlier today i was washing my hands and remembered a pretty significant traumatic event in my childhood. \n\nI was watching tv moments before this and the characters onscreen got in a car wreck. I started thinking about trauma and about the phrase repeated to me when i was in therapy in my late teens: \"where's the trauma?\".\n\nSuddenly i was thinking about a sleepover, the only sleepover i went on as a kid, when i was like 8. I remembered playing with a toy i got for my birthday, a little \"spy microphone\" with a dish for listening to conversations far away, and being in the car going home the next day and it was like i was there in the car again and there was this horrible emptiness, all the light and color just gone from the world.\n\nIt was weird, like a voice in my head said: \"but why are you thinking about this in particular\" and when i tried to reach into my memory for an answer and that act of reaching for it was like a hot knife in my brain. The sink zoomed at me and time and place went out the window, the color of the lights in the bathroom went orange.\n\nI tried to reassure myself that its just panic but holy wow hyperventilation, visual distortions, ears ringing, objects swelling and shrinking, pacing and crazy thoughts. Nasty thoughts. I called 988 and talked to a wonderful woman for a while in very disjointed speech, i remember saying things that made sense followed by completely nonsensical stuff. After the 40 minute phone call and a half hour of deep breathing the panic began to fade, reality settled, and the anger came and it was sort of a relief.\n\nIts like I've always known but i never let myself know what happened. In this moment i can remember things around it but not the event itself. I feel like i can infer what happened but idfk. Writing this is literally dizzying.\n\nThere's a spooky feeling like a bad acid trip or a deliriant OD, and a kind of warning or alarm or whatever, a feeling like something in me is under tremendous strain and might break.\n\nIt helps to touch my ear and say \"its okay, i got you, youre safe, youre here now, i love you\" \n\nIm a little scared, but i feel hope.

It lasted until i was 8.\n\nMy abuser was never held responsible for what he did to me.  My mother and her family covered it up and i suffered in silence until i was 25 and the rest of the family found out.  Even then, he was allowed to just continue living his life and went on to abuse more little girls for which he was eventually charged.  They served a warrant on his computer and charged him with over 50 counts of possession of child pornography.  He shot himself in the head the morning he was supposed to be in court and rearrested for the computer stuff since he was already being charged with abusing 2 other little girls.\n\nI am struggling with the thoughts that at least some of those photos are likely of me when i was 4-8.  I don't know for sure but this happened in the 90s and i have a gut feeling he took pictures of me while i was sleeping or at least he thought i was.  It's possible that none of those photos were me, but i remember him taking pictures of me in harmless situations for no reason.  But only me, never of my brother.\n\nHow do i get past this feeling?  There is no way he abused me as much as he did without taking photos as momentos, but even if there are photos of me circulating in pedophile spaces, i don't even think i could find out for sure, there just isn't a way for anyone to search those spaces.  I considered calling the police department that handled the warrant, submitting a childhood photo of me, and just asking them to confirm yes or no if they believed they saw me in any of those photos, but i believe he killed himself in 2016 or 2017 and most police departments don't keep non homicide case files more than 7 years.\n\nEven if i did and they confirmed they have seen a pornographic photo of me as a child, what would i even do with this information?  I could never verify that ALL photos of me were removed, and there is no way to find them without visiting these spaces and asking for photos.  If there are pre-pubescent photos of me, there isn't anything i can do about it except spiral with that information.\n\nBut i can't stop ruminating on it.  My brain feels like i HAVE to know, but my heart knows that will probably hurt me more tha  help me.  I am in therapy now for the last 6 years, i have gone absolutely no contact whatsoever with any blood relatives of mine, and i am now raising a beautiful happy and safe family of my own.

I've absolutely noticed that my nervous system is a lot calmer, even on only a nightly dose. I got the best effects at 200mcg, but I lowered my dose because I found the dry mouth and dry eyes side effect kind of annoying. I would use a mouth lubricant + eye drops, which helped. I find that at 100mcg I still get benefits (though not as much) but without the side effects. \n\nI'm 27F (so peak population most at risk of hypotension) and I take 150mg of spironolactone as well for acne (also drops your blood pressure). I've also taken 25mg of quetiapine as well for a period of time, though I'm not on it anymore. Before both medications, my blood pressure was around 110/70. My blood pressure sits at about 100-105/70 on both spiro and clonidine. When I started clonidine I definitely felt a little dizzy the first two nights when I got up to go to the bathroom, but it quickly subsided after that. I have taken prazosin before, and that was much worse in terms of orthostatic hypotension.

In May I got a neurological evaluation done and got the results back in July and was rediagosed with ADHD, CPTSD with dissociative symptoms. I was adopted from Central America when I was 3 months. I got diagnosed with cerebral palsy when I was 6 month old and had to do therapy all through my childhood and was in and out of the hospital all my life for surgeries. \n\nWhen I was a senior of high school on the first day of school my bus was about 2 hours late and I got home late ( this happened for 2 weeks)and at the same time I was with an autistic individual who i have been afraid of for years. I don’t what caused my mental health to go down hill but i think those 2 events played apart. My special education teacher saw that I was struggling even though I was trying so hard to hide it. She broke my mask and everyday for the rest of the year i cried. Me and the school psychologist saw each other every day. One event in school traumatized me so much that I couldn’t go back to my government class because we watched a movie where in the first 5 minutes of the movie there was violence( I don’t have any trauma related to this, my body due the CP has a very strong reaction to stuff) and my mental health went really down hill from there. My special education teacher was so supportive and patient with me. I had lunch with her every day. She comforted me when I was crying. \n\nI went to the 18-21 program that helps disabled people that had their own room in the high school. My first year I had a surgery that I didn’t want and my program teacher was there for me when I needed her to be. She helped me calmed down and helped me through dissociation. \nThen my old special teacher came and worked in the program my last year and supported me and both teachers knew how to make me laugh and cry but one important thing they knew how to calm me down. \nNow when ever i feel like/crying i call out for them and wish they were here to help me.

And then I found disgusting comments about me how he was settling, other women were so much more beautiful than I, etc and it was like that one little veil that was up for me about our relationship that was justifying it came down and I saw everything for what it was.

Now that I'm older Im realizing just how dysfunctional my brain is compared to the people around me. I normally don't notice that I'm not feeling anything positive, until I realized by mid-December that I didn't feel anything towards Christmas season.\n\nI used to LOVE Christmas. Christmas spirit would hit me way faster than anyone else, and I loved buying gifts and decorating and baking cookies and listening to music and everything, and this year I didn't feel a damn thing. The 20th came and went. Then the 21st. Then the 22nd. 23rd, 24th, then the 25th, and then it was the 26th. Nothing. Besides the fleeting \"joy\" when recieving my gifts, I didn't feel fucking anything. I know I'm here physically, and in the moment I feel mentally present, but when I recall the last 2 months, I feel like I've been floating through time, just moving from one day to the next. Like I've been existing, not living. I don't feel passive joy or happiness, the only large, memorable emotions are sadness and anger and stress. \n\nI often cope by telling myself it isn't that bad. I'm nowhere near as suicidal as I used to be.  I'm not in agonizing pain, my flashbacks don't seem to hurt as much as they used to, i dont have nightmares, so I should be fine right? Thing is I didn't realize that not being happy was also a problem, and now Im so used to it that the idea of fixing it is scary, and feels impossible. It also feels safer to an extent, as I don't have a strong enough support system to help me get back up if I were to fall apart right now. I don't have time to be distressed or so upset that i cant do anything, so repression is kind of my only option for now. \n\nI dunno. I feel helpless and lost, but also perfectly capable at the same time. Obviously they can't both be true, but trying to think about it only stresses me out more. I wish there was a quick fix. I miss my Christmas spirit, and I miss excitement in general. I miss enjoying my life and the things around me. It's so hard for me to come across nowadays.\n\nDoes anyone else relate? I genuinely don't have anything huge in my current day life to be depressed about but I can't shake off this funk I'm in. I plan to start therapy in the new year, but until then, shouldn't I be able to feel happy about literally anything? Its not supposed to be this complicated :(\n\nP.S: I should note that Im diagnosed with PTSD \"with dissociative symptoms.\" No one ever explained what those were supposed to be but i have a hunch this is related.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "I’m starting to think that maybe I’m quite a manipulative person unintentionally", "text": "I (18F) feel quite guilty after a conversation I had with my friend (18F) I’ll call Cat yesterday. I have a lot of difficulty around friends. I’ve been bullied most of my life and have Autism and PTSD too which makes me very sensitive to people leaving me or hurting me.\n\nI try my best to be a good friend to Cat but recently I’ve realised that I’m quite manipulative unintentionally. And I don’t really know what to do. I feel a lot of guilt after our conversation yesterday.\n\nI was a bit drunk tbh and now I’ve sobered up the hangxiety has kicked in because I feel I might’ve been manipulative and I’m so embarrassed I can’t read the texts to double check but I’m realising I do this often.\n\nLast night basically she was telling me how much she hates people in her class. I used to be in her college too but quit because of bullying. I told her that I don’t like a lot of people from her class too. And she I said about how one of her friends I’ll call Ellie is rude to her a lot and it really hurts her feeling and I said I think she needs to drop her and I’d never treat her like that. When I mean she probably shouldn’t drop her over it maybe just have a conversation.\n\nShe also asked me who I dislike the most from the college. And I put my bully in the number one spot and a girl that bullied her in the number two spot. I said I already didn’t like her bully before that and she used to be in my number 3 spot but after she bullied her she moved up to number 2. She asked who used to be in the number 2 spot and I said it’s mean because we get along better now. And she told me to say. I said our “friend” Ivy. She is quite a toxic friend honestly and we’ve had a lot of arguments. But we are getting a long better now. My friend is trying to distance herself from her though.\n\nShe said if she drops Ellie she might try to work thinks out between her and Ivy. I said I think I might drop Ivy because “she PMO” and I don’t know why I still talk to her. She asked why and I said about a time she and her mum suggested I was a slut. Which tbf I was validly upset about that.\n\nBut I started stirring the pot too by bringing up things Ivy and her mum said about her. About how they don’t like how religious she is. They one time speculated that she was asexual or she wouldn’t be ok with waiting till marriage to have sex (something she told Ivy and I because she’s our friend so it was odd that Ivy had mentioned this to her mum.) and pittying her for how “indoctrinated” she is by her religion. (She’s a normal amount religious). Also Cat has OCD and Ivy’s mother one time told me how I should act around people with OCD. (Her mum doesn’t have ocd or know anyone who does). But she basically said I need to talk to her in a certain way.\n\nI told Cat all these things Ivy and her mum had said about her knowing it would upset her they’ve said other things about her but I purposely said the OCD,Religous and Sexual ones because I know they would get her most riled up. And I said “she’s honestly a bully and her relationship with her mum is so weird” you deserve way better friends than Ivy and Ellie.\n\nI’m now realising I was trying to make me seem like a better friend. I’m not that good of a friend to be honest. I want to be better. But I think I only really told her those things to make me seem good and them seem bad. Like I could be the best friend she ever needs. And one day when she realises I’m a terrible person maybe she won’t leave me and I won’t be alone.\n\nDo you think what I did sounds manipulative? I didn’t even realise what I was doing until now. But I do constantly do things like that. I remember one time she said about how she went around the college one day and literally everyone was nice to her just randomly. Like everyone was going up to her excited to see her being overly nice and hugging her and stuff and calling her a queen and their wife.\n\nI thought maybe it was a form of bullying. Because she said now she wasn’t really close to these people and she found it a bit odd. And I said “maybe they were just being nice or thought you seemed sad and wanted to cheer you up. Or maybe they were testing you to see how you’d react as a joke idk.” Now I’m realising maybe I was just jealous how people were treating her so nicely when I got treated like shit and because one of the people who were nice to her was really awful to me and I didn’t want Cat to become friends with her and us become less close.\n\nI feel like a really bad person. I don’t mean to be manipulative when I say these things. How can I stop? I want to be a good friend I’ve dealt with manipulative people all my life from being abused and bullied and stuff and I’m scared I’m becoming like that with my friend. She doesn’t deserve me to be honest. She is such a kind person. She deserves better. I don’t know why I do this but I don’t realise until after.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1766903996.0, "id": "1pxklii", "author": "Old-Fisherman-6079", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1pxklii/im_starting_to_think_that_maybe_im_quite_a/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "I'm not sure that it's strictly brain damage. Perhaps your brain reoriented its resources towards functions which it deemed more important at the time and later failed to realize that another update would be a good move. The point I'm trying to make is that you probably don't want to think in terms of going back to the old settings but rather how to rewire the current setup of your mind to give back resources where they are due - in this case - your verbal fluency, working memory and speech.\n\nI have no doubt that you recovered plenty on the emotional plane but perhaps there is still some impingement on your mind or a low grade dissociation which makes verbalization difficult. There's a lot to be said about being grounded as well. Maybe your feet used to be firmer on the ground prior to the event whereas now you have more of your energy stuck in your mind but it's not being used in an efficient manner. It's akin to static noise which you don't even realize is there and it's function is just to provide layers of protection from the outside world. It goes away for the most part when you start to ground yourself properly. The energy needs to go back to the entire body where it belongs at which point the mind itself has the proper amount of activity left, it won't be overclocked. Also another thing to consider is that your prefrontal cortex is underactive and the amygdala is overactive but you just got used to it as a normal baseline. If you were to get yourself into a state where there is less amygdala activity and a bit more prefrontal cortex you would probably realize that you were quite restless prior.\n\nLet me know if any of this seems plausible and rezonates.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767112802.0, "id": "nwr7dzl", "author": "CasuallyPeaking"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "First and foremost, cover the basics if you haven't already. That means:\n\n\\- Getting good sleep and enough of it\n\n\\- Moving plenty and on a daily basis. Long walks as a bare minimum and ideally some sport on top of that\n\n\\- Regular visits to nature. By nature I don't mean the local city park but nature proper. A forest, a hiking trail, the seaside, the nearby village, whatever floats your boat and whatever is doable for you. Cities are noisy and artificial. They create a lot of mental noise.\n\nAll of these are helpful in grounding yourself and gaining a baseline of confidence in your basic abilities. Now comes one counterintuitive suggestion - stop worrying about it. You know how the people who are worried and uptight can't really let loose and enjoy themselves on a party? Esentially they can't dance. Good dancers are relaxed and are motivated purely by lighthearted fun and enjoyment. Speech is a kind of dance. You are moving air and sound in a certain fashion in order to produce meaning, emotion, music. If you're too worried about how it's gonna come across no wonder you'll stuff up, freeze up, slow down. Go with the flow, keep saying random stuff and see how it goes.\n\nTo be more concrete - maybe it's time to stop relying on having a good idea of what to say and start speaking without having thoughts about the speech. You can try it out by yourself at home. \n\nStep 1 would be reading some defined text such a book out loud so that your vocal cords once again get used to being fluent, in rhythm, not having pauses. \n\nOnce you're comfy with that you can try talking about a random object in your home for 5 minutes straight. Just see what you can come up with on the spot. It literally doesn't matter what you say, how correct or intelligent it sounds. The entire point is to just keep going and allow your vocal cords to enter a flow state which will start carrying you effortlessly after a while.\n\nAfter that you could get into singing with nothing but an instrumental of some song. You can start off with singing the actual lyrics you know and if you're feeling adventurous you start making up your own lyrics on the spot.\n\nI'm pretty certain that if you keep up with these kind of exercises on the regular you'll be fine after a few months.

'You can't blame anyone but yourself, so stop crying.'\" I was then put into an extremely toxic eating disorder program where I was bullied by the other patients because I ate all of my food, and then was interrogated constantly by the medical staff on how I wasn't gaining weight despite eating. My outpatient doctor finally convinced my parents to pull me because there was clearly something else going on. Then I started to develop rumination syndrome because I was so anxious, and I had to deal with that on top of my new medical team trying to figure out what was actually wrong with me.

I'm happy that the doctors know what's going on now, but I feel so broken by everything I've been through. After this hospital visit, it feels like everything has started to really ramp up. Since then I've just been a mess. Horrible insomnia because I'm afraid of the nightmares I get every single time I fall asleep, I can't get out of bed because I feel so fatigued, and I feel so weepy and sad constantly, with little warning or reason. \n\nToday my family was watching the new season of Stranger Things, and I could only make it through the first episode before I told my parents I was going to shower, and then just broke down. All of the screaming, the loud noises, it just really really upsets me. It was never like this before. I just want to go back to when I didn't get upset so easily. My mom made me feel like I was being too sensitive about it, and now I just feel worse. They're still watching it downstairs and even the sounds are making me feel scared and nauseous. I'm so tired.", "score": 4, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1766896960.0, "id": "1pxifjj", "author": "Traditional_Sea_1839", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1pxifjj/i_cant_do_regular_things_anymore_because/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "PTSD", "title": "Flashbacks? Please advise!", "text": "I might have been having flashbacks for a few months, but I find it hard to know for sure, since flashbacks are usually portrayed as hallucinations/psychosis-like in movies and media. If these are flashbacks, they don't happen TOO often -- like 0-2 times per month, maybe. My last one was pretty intense, and was a few days before Christmas.\n\nI usually lie down when it happens. To the outsider, it can look like I'm napping/sleeping/dozing off. I think it's possible I have facial expressions during them, but I'm not 100% sure. Sometimes I move around during them, but I think from the outside, it might just look like restless sleep. I am very quiet during it.\n\nI lose awareness of reality and get sucked into my past traumas, often triggered by a reminder. Time can get really distorted. The last time it happened, I was certain it had been at least 3 hours, but it had actually only been 1-1.5 hours. I involuntarily see, in my mind's eye, the memories, but they usually do involve some fiction, since the memories are not complete. But the essence matches what happened. I feel the emotions of the memory very intensely. Sometimes I can physically feel parts of it, but it's mostly just the visuals and the emotions. The emotions are overwhelming. The memory will repeat/replay over and over until the flashback finishes. Usually, my heart beats fast and my breathing gets faster. I often start to feel shaky. \n\nThere are times during it that I do regain awareness of reality, but usually only briefly before I get sucked back into it. I think this is usually a sign that it's beginning to end. The last time I had one, I regained awareness of reality and was able to send a message to some of my friends, \"I've been stuck in my trauma for hours\" before being pulled back in. Then, it ended pretty gradually, with me gaining awareness every so often, and each time I gained awareness, it lasted longer and I was more functional. When it's finally over, I feel \"off\" and emotionally sensitive for usually a few more hours.\n\nIs this a flashback?", "score": 4, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1766896250.0, "id": "1pxi77f", "author": "TheRealRaccoon98", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1pxi77f/flashbacks_please_advise/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Flashbacks are different for everyone and it's important to remember that despite what you see in the media flashbacks aren't always visual. They can be thoughts, feelings or physical reactions to something that takes your mind back to the traumatic event(s). What you're describing sounds like dissociation which goes hand in hand with flashbacks. Dissociation can be a type of flashback. Maybe you dissociated during the traumatic experience(s) or maybe your mind is trying to puzzle everything together or protect itself. Flashbacks aren't black and white. It's tough to say what is and isn't a flashback. Everyones trauma is different and the way your body handles trauma is unique to you. No one else in the whole world has ever nor will ever experience the exact same trauma and post traumatic stress as you. If you have feelings where for a second or longer you feel reminded by trauma that is a flashback.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "I agree with this. Flashbacks are personal and different to everyone. It helped me to think about flashbacks and intrusive memories as categories. \n\n1) uncomfortable reminders - these are fully concious reminders. For example driving past the street where something happened. I know I will think of it but remain 'online' enough to self soothe and talk to myself kindly\n\n2) distressing reminders/memories - these can pop up randomly. Usually thoughts or visuals, occasionally somatic but remain aware of where I am in the present. Usually more so when im feeling on edge, or anxious. My brain starts running through things that happened to kind of remind me of what happens when thngs go wrong. Grounding helps then self soothe. These are the most common for me. \n\n3) flashback - completely go into the past. Visuals are as if I am back there, somatic sensations as if it is actually happening right now. Fight/flight/freeze activated. Cant control this one. Can only ground, self soothe afterwards\n\n4) dissociation - to be honest this is hard to explain. Like there is no concious memory or sensations but its like im falling back into something. Very scary to be honest and difficult to pull out of. Need to anchor onto something - a sound or sensation in the present but cant always do it.\n\nEvery person you speak to who has had trauma will give you different experiences. I spent a long time cross checking what I was experiencing was 'actually a flashback' or is it reallt dissociation etc. End of the day I learnt this is your experience and thats valid. Other people have their experiences and thats valid too. (And movies always way exaggerate. Hunger games 2 has a good representation. Where she shoots at a deer but just the second she does that it changes to her shooting someone she shot in the game. Its a second but the response is as if she was back there)", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1766971849.0, "id": "nwgun4c", "author": "DevelopmentFit485"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "PTSD", "text": "Firstly, what happened to you was sexual assault. Do not let anyone convince you otherwise. It was not a “friendly” kiss or a “friendly” touch. If you did not want it, if it made you uncomfortable, if it crossed your boundaries then it was sexual assault no matter how anyone else tries to twist the situation.\n\nMay I ask why do you want to contact him?\nIf it’s for closure, if you’re hoping to ask him why he did it or to hear something that will help you heal, please don’t!!! That kind of closure will not come from him. Sexual abusers do not prioritise their victims. If he cared he would have taken responsibility, gotten help or reached out on his own. He wouldn’t have done this repeatedly to you then left like nothing happened. Hoping his morals will suddenly show up now will only lead to more disappointment and pain.\n\nPlease also do not contact him for any financial help whether it’s for college or anything else. This is a man who hurt you as a child and didn’t care how it’d impact you in any way. You should not have to rely on someone who abused you in any capacity especially financially!!! I’m truly sorry that you don’t have the evidence needed to pursue justice and put an end to this. But involving him will only hurt you more. Please do not do this. This is not a good idea. Reaching out to him, telling him you remember what he did and then placing yourself in a position where he holds power over you because of money will only make you more vulnerable. Even if it feels like a solution right now, trust me it will do far more harm than good to your mental health and safety in the long run.\n\nI know it can feel like he owes you something for the damage he caused, that feeling makes complete sense and I understand you. But no amount of money, no explanation and no words from him will ever make up for what he did to you or give you the closure that you deserve. That kind of healing can only come from within yourself and from the support of a therapist or safe trusted people you know you can rely on for help.\n\nIf you’re considering speaking out to make it known to your family please think carefully before doing so. I don’t know your family dynamic or living situation but in many families this can unfortunately cause more harm to you than support. Try to imagine how the situation could unfold and how it might affect you in the future. Protecting yourself ALWAYS comes first. Please have a plan if this turns left. \n\nNone of this was your fault. You did not deserve what happened to you. Your safety, peace and healing matters more than anything else. You deserve peace and doing this will not bring you peace. You are strong, stronger than you realise. I truly believe you have the strength to build and carve your own path towards a safer, healthier, independent and successful future for yourself that is free from him.

Xmas as a child was spent worrying about whichever parent might be lonely ( divorced parents) or feeling terrified that one of them would die when I wasn’t there. Teenage years were ok as it was all about friends. Then after having my first baby I had PND around xmas and that was truly awful. That was 15 years ago, but almost every year since I seem to have what feels like a short breakdown. They have all been so traumatic, and each year I feel braced waiting for the anxiety and terror to hit. I get totally overwhelmed and feel like I’m back in the past, feel the same panic and feel like I’ll never escape. It can last 3-4 days and then mostly I start to feel slowly more normal, but every time it happens I feel like I’ll never recover. I feel like a total failure as a mum and a person when I’m like this. Can anyone relate?
