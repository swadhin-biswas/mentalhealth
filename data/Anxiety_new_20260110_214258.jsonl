Something with protein, salt, nuts, or even fruit. Sometimes if mine is really bad I just have to reduce whatever I was doing in half and have grace with myself.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Context matters: While unsupervised or incorrect use of medication can be considered misuse, a blanket statement that breaking a pill in half is a sign of drug abuse, without further assessment, may be considered an overreaction or misjudgment, especially if the pill was suitable for splitting and no other abuse factors were present.\n \nReporting the Psychiatrist\nIf you believe the psychiatrist acted unprofessionally or provided inadequate care, you can file a complaint with the appropriate authorities. \nState Medical Board: This is the primary agency responsible for investigating complaints against licensed physicians (including psychiatrists) in your state(?) They can take disciplinary action if they find the psychiatrist's conduct fell below the standard of care. You can find your state board's contact information through the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB).\n\nObviously, xanxe bars are \"scored\" for the exact purpose of dose control. Any doctor (in my opinion) should know this. The only exception I could think of is you're are explicitly prescribed 2mg doses to be taken. If not I don't see how taking less (what you personally feel you need) is a problem but being told by your doctor it's a problem could very well constitute a problem lol. I would look into it and concider reporting. It's your body, no one can make you take anything in Amy amount you don't want to. You're thr only ones who truly knows how you feel and should be free to use your medication as you see fit as long as you don't abuse it but taking less is never concidered abusing your medication.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Anxiety medication advice", "text": "For some context before I get to the story:\nI was diagnosed with anxiety in September 2021 just over a year before I went through a traumatic experience and made my anxiety worse (which is now stable and I still have days where it's worse). When I was discussing treatment options with my gp he said that he didn't recommend me to go on medication and instead try talking therapy. Which is working and I have improved according to both my gp and psychologist. Especially since I went through trauma (one incident was my grandma's death which was unexpected and unnatural).\nNow here is the story and I think I'm overthinking this (I'm an overthinker). I volunteer at an op shop. Have been since September 2024. I'm there every Wednesday morning and my manager wants to increase my hours. Last Wednesday was my bad day in regards to my anxiety and had my strategy ready in place just in case. I have been having issues with one of my colleague for a while my supervisor knows about it and she gave me advice. (This was a few weeks ago). So the colleague that I have been having issues with came and said hi to me and I was in no mood to talk so I just smiled and nodded and went back to my task. She then came close to me and looked really close to me and said why aren't you talking to me? I said could you please leave me alone I am having a tough day and I already acknowledged you. I said it really professionally and calmly and she went to the back. She then told my manager and my manager came up to me in the middle of the store and spoke to me about it. The other colleague came out of the back and I said to my manager can we please talk in the back. I started crying at this point. I told her everything about my concerns about the other colleague. Instead of helping me she defended the other colleague. Explaining that she is one of my trusted volunteers and how she was a regional manager at a big clothing store and how she wants both of us to stay. Then says you need to go on anxiety medication. This was the second time she told me this. The first time I let it go but this time she crossed a line that she can't uncross. I am so upset. It's been bothering me since Wednesday. I would like your take on this. I don't want to be on medication now as I am improving and I feel like I don't need and I am surviving without it. I am thinking of seeing my gp again and tell him what happened and ask for his opinion. I just wanted to vent and ask for your opinion. Thank you for reading and have a great day!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Life story of a lonely cat..", "text": "\nFor the past six years, my life has felt like a long test of endurance—one loss after another, one heartbreak piled on top of the previous one.\nIt all began when my grandfather died. His death shattered something inside me that never fully healed. He was my emotional anchor, and losing him felt like losing safety itself. I somehow survived that pain, but it changed me forever. I became quieter, heavier inside, learning how to exist with grief rather than without it.\nJust when I thought life might stabilize after graduation, it collapsed again. I was thrown out of my own apartment—not because of my mistake, but because my uncle mismanaged money and used the apartment to pay off his loans. Overnight, I lost my home. I lost control. I didn’t know where to go or what to do. I had no friends to lean on, no one to hear me. I was completely alone.\nOut of loneliness, I turned to a dating app—not for fun, but for connection, for warmth. That’s when I met a girl who turned out to be toxic. I fell in love blindly, desperately wanting to believe someone could choose me. Later I realized she was trying to honeytrap me into marriage. It broke me to accept that, but leaving her was the hardest and bravest thing I did for myself at that time.\nThen I met another girl from the Philippines. She was only 20. She didn’t understand me deeply, and emotionally she was fragile, always crying. Eventually, it ended—but the end pushed me into depression. I sank so low that even breathing felt heavy. During that time, my brother was the only reason I survived. His support kept me alive when I had nothing left in me.\nAfter that, life didn’t give me rest. I was jobless. For months—three, four months—my family pressured me constantly. Every day felt like a reminder that I wasn’t enough. Somehow, through sheer survival instinct, I found a remote job. For the first time in a long while, I felt hope. I worked honestly, quietly, consistently.\nYears passed. One by one, staff members left the company. I stayed. I became the last one standing. Still, I felt invisible. Stable, but lonely.\nIn 2024, loneliness pushed me to love again. I met a girl who was also depressed because she was jobless. I gave her everything I had—my time, my energy, my emotional strength. I motivated her when she had no belief in herself. I stayed up late listening, encouraging, pushing her forward. After two months, she started getting interviews. Eventually, she landed a remote job at Jack Daniels.\nI was proud of her. Truly.But slowly, the dynamic changed.\nShe started looking down on me because she earned more than I did. The same person who once needed my strength began to see me as less. Still, I loved her. I accepted everything about her—her flaws, her past, her insecurities. But she couldn’t accept me the same way.\nIn December 2025, I had to let her go.Not because I stopped loving her—but because loving her meant losing myself.\nThat breakup destroyed something deep inside me. Since then, life hasn’t just been bad—it’s been unbearable. Every day feels heavier than the last. My family is in chaos. I’m in chaos. It feels like no matter how much I give, how much I endure, how much I try to be strong—life keeps taking without mercy.\nI’m exhausted.I’m hurting.And for the first time, I don’t know how to move forward.\nBut if there’s one truth buried under all this pain, it’s this: I survived things that should have broken me completely.And maybe that means my story isn’t over yet—even if right now, it feels unbearable to continue.\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768019130.0, "id": "1q8uhua", "author": "lxdragneel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q8uhua/life_story_of_a_lonely_cat/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Life after a septic kidney stone", "text": "I (30F) don't even know where to begin with this all, but I just know I need to feel less alone. And I take medication (I have diagnosed anxiety - not related to this experience) and have a therapy appointment scheduled for next week, so please know I'm doing everything I can to take care of myself.\n\nAbout 7 weeks ago, I woke up in excruciating back and stomach pain and went to urgent care. I was hit by a car while crossing a crosswalk about 6 years ago, and this back pain was comparable to the 2 bones I broke in my back from that car accident 😅 Urgent care couldn't do any imaging but told me it was likely a kidney stone but they couldn't rule out appendicitis. So I went to the hospital and got a CT scan which showed a 3mm kidney stone. I got me some good pain meds and felt a little better for a bit but then I started feeling absolutely terrible and feverish and went back to the ER. They gave me some fentanyl and a bunch of other shit but ultimately sent me home and told me to drink lots of fluids...but then my fever got worse and I felt like I was going to die. I was cold all over and couldn't stop shaking, and my brain fog was awful. \n\nAfter going back to the ER, they did more tests which showed I had a growing infection. The stone was blocking the flow of urine which was causing bacteria to leak into my bloodstream and spread throughout my body. They admitted me to the hospital, and while I was waiting for a room to become available, I finally fell asleep (filled with more fentanyl and nausea meds). Then, I woke up to my nurse shaking me awake and looking panicked and telling me they're taking me to the OR. My heart rate was 130bpm (I looked at the monitor because it felt like it was going to beat right through my ribs) right when I woke up, and I've never been so scared (again, I've been hit by a car 😅).\n\nAnyway, to fast forward a bit, I had a stent placed and then kept the stent and stone in for a month while the infection cleared with antibiotics. I had a second procedure to remove the stone and stent about 3 weeks ago, and I'm in an extremely abyss level of darkness mentally/emotionally.\n\nI think part of it is because I was sent home from the ER twice even though the second time I had told them I felt really sick and like I had a whole body infection. So now I just don't feel safe and like I'll be taken care of when I'm sick. And the anesthesia really fucked me up because I didn't know if I was going to even wake up from the first procedure, and I imagine death to be like being under anesthesia where it's just absolute darkness. Just a complete abyss.\n\nI was all alone at the hospital without my friends or family, and I thought that could be the end for me. I also woke up with the breathing tube still in the second time which just amplified the feeling of being out of control of my own body. I've tried talking about it all with friends and family and my partner, but I feel like nobody really gets it. I would have died if I hadn't gone back to the hospital the third time, and it all escalated so quickly. I keep getting intrusive thoughts about how nothing matters because we all die anyway.\n\nI'm not suicidal, but this is the emptiest and most lost I've ever felt. I feel like I'm carrying a candle in a dark dark abyss wasteland, and I do everything I can to protect the candle and keep the flame alive, but there's no end to the darkness and life is just keeping a candle burning until we all eventually disappear into the void...\n\nI know how incredibly morbid this all sounds because I'm normally a happy person. I just feel hopeless and empty and alone, and I don't even know if there's anything anyone can say to help me, but I'm here and I'm trying.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "I'm aware of bupropion and have taken it myself, but it's affinity for dopamine transporter is not significant, and most of the heavylifting is done by primarily NRI metabolites, not the parent drug. \n\nThat's why it's not nearly as abused as amphetamine or methylphenidate. NDRIs are definitely more addictive than SSRI's or SNRI's. The boom of cathinones and pyrovalerones like MDPV, aPVP, aPHP are potent NDRIs, known for being very fiendy and compulsive, because of their potent DAT inhibition and very short acute peak. \n\nThey're notoriously known for being way more addictive than other drugs, especially MDPV.  The profound dopamine release obviously induced tweaking and euphoria, as well as compulsive redosing. \n\nDopamine is also the major component of meth and amphetamine euphoria, as well as opioid euphoria. Obviously a dopaminergic drug is going to be more addictive, more than SSRI's which indirectly suppresses dopamine, that's part of why SSRIs numb libido and may induce emotional blunting and apathy, compared to NDRIs. Every drug of abuse directly or indirectly increases dopamine, therefore every drug of abuse one way or another acts on the reward circuitry. \n\nSSRIs and SNRIs have minimal abuse liability exactly, because they not only don't increase dopamine but indirectly inhibit dopamine via 5HT2C and 5HT1A inhibitory pathways. They're just not recreational for that reason. \n\nDopaminergic stimulants definitely have far higher abuse liability and euphoria than SSRIs and SNRIs. No one snorts SSRIs, but people definitely snort methylphenidate and amphetamines for their dopaminergic euphoria. \n\n&gt;. NDRIs are no more \"addictive\" than other classes of antidepressants to my knowledge\n\nAre you sure? methylphenidate and similar stimulants are not more addictive than antidepressants? antidepressants are not addictive in the first place, because they're not recreational. They cause physical dependence but not the same addiction that a dopaminergic stimulant causes with its euphoria.\n\n&gt;**SSRIs and SNRIs have** ***very low to negligible misuse/addiction liability***  \nLarge clinical and review articles agree that SSRIs and SNRIs are **not associated with drug‑seeking behaviors or reinforcement**, and are *not considered addictive* in the sense used in DSM‑5 and addiction medicine. Discontinuation symptoms can occur (often called *withdrawal*), but this is distinct from addiction because it does not involve compulsive use driven by euphoria or reinforcement\n\n**Bupropion does have** ***documented misuse and abuse potential***  \nBupropion is structurally related to cathinones and has dopaminergic effects, and while it is not as potent or reinforcing as classic stimulants, misuse *does occur*. - [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4162783/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4162783/)\n\nThat's something that rarely shows up with SSRIs or SNRIs. In one analysis, *nearly 11%* of adverse events related to bupropion were coded as misuse/abuse/dependence. This doesn’t mean it’s common, but it does mean it exists, and at rates far above what’s seen with SSRIs/SNRIs.\n\nSSRIs and SNRIs work mainly on serotonin (and norepinephrine for SNRIs), which does *not* directly activate the dopamine reward circuitry that contributes to euphoria and reinforcement.\n\nDrugs that block reuptake of dopamine (like stimulants including methylphenidate, amphetamines, and potent cathinones) directly increase synaptic dopamine in the **mesolimbic reward pathway**, making them much more reinforcing and prone to misuse. Agents like MDPV and pyrovalerones are notorious for this, and are often described as highly compulsive and addictive for precisely that reason.\n\n**NDRIs have demonstrably greater abuse potential than SSRIs/SNRIs** \\- albeit much lower than classical stimulants like amphetamine or cocaine. The reward circuitry engagement that makes stimulants addictive is not present in SSRIs/SNRIs, which is why they are reported not to produce drug‑seeking behaviors or euphoria typical of addiction", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768050256.0, "id": "nys3164", "author": "Rude_Lengthiness_101"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "That's why it's recommended to research before starting any medication. SSRI's like many serotonergic drugs, increase serotonin, which indirectly suppresses dopamine, which normally modulates libido, motivation, pleasure, reward and emotional salience. Part of why SSRIs are so effective for anxiety disorders is the emotional blunting they have, decreasing emotional sensitivity, which is helpful in cases of anxiety disorder like GAD.\n\nWhen you have anxiety disorder, your circuits involved in fear and your amygdala, keep sensitizing the fight-or-flight response and neutral stimuli begin triggering stress response when they shouldn't. In that case, SSRIs decrease the sensitivity and threshold, but this also decreases reward and libido sensitivity, because SSRI's increase serotonin all over the brain, not in selective spots. They're selective for serotonin transporter, but not specific regions, like the ones involved in libido.\n\nBasically, in cases of anxiety disorder and anxious depression, the mental issue itself has detrimental effect on libido higher than the medication would have. In that case, despite the libido blunting, SSRIs may still provide a net benefit and improvement in wellbeing and the libido-blunting is not seen as a big problem. Others simply accept the trade of mental wellbeing for libido.\n\nFor someone who doesn't have anxiety as a major component of their issues, SSRI's can be too emotionally blunting and kill libido completely. For them, SSRIs are just too strong and too emotionally sedating.\n\nThere are antidepressants that are less prone to libido issues and should be considered when consulting with a doctor. Bupropion tends to have none or libido enhancing effects in people. SNRI's are less libido-numbing than purely SSRIs, but they still numb it. Mirtazapine is quite libido-sparing, but raises appetite. For someone who feels libido is huge part of their mental wellbeing, a combo of bupropion+mirtazapine is a well known one.\n\nSo it's definitely the SSRI causing this. Benzodiazepines don't tend to increase serotonin or inhibit dopamine enough to blunt libido.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768046955.0, "id": "nyrvpjy", "author": "Rude_Lengthiness_101"}

I’m trying to be a teen, and I can’t with these heavy feelings I have, and also her feelings on me. I’ve given subtle hints telling her like “when you tell me this I throw up and my head reels and reels.” Or “I’m sorry this stuff makes me anxious I don’t know what to say.” But I genuinely can’t take this feeling anymore.\n\nive told her mother in secret. She doesn’t wanna burden them, but I couldn’t bare it knowing she had an ED and I was the only one who knew. Nothing really changed her mom just makes her eat once a day, but she throws away all the food in her lunchbox. like no hesitation. \n\nIve even tried like trying to change her music taste to something more positive, like I made a whole presentation as a thoughtful thing, about facts, and influencers for help, and foods she could eat tha would fill her up and were low-cal. I tried really hard the presentation took 8 hours to make. And she didnt do anything. Shes watching the scale like crazy. It’s make me so anxious and I  can’t even help anymore.\n\n⚠️Advice for the future when I get back from the trip, but also for tomorrow; it’s my first flight and I’m already terrified enough, I need something to calm my mind, everyone with anxiety, I don’t do breathing exercises but what’s a method you use to calm yourself temporarily?⚠️", "score": 2, "num_comments": 6, "created_utc": 1768010087.0, "id": "1q8rabh", "author": "Ok_Position_65", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q8rabh/please_help_me/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Can anxiety lead to constant physical sensations for years?", "text": "Hello,\n\nI’m 26 years old and I’ve been dealing with physical symptoms for almost 10 years. I’m writing now because for about a month my anxiety has become severe, constant, and very disabling.\n\nFor years, I’ve had sensations that are hard to explain: my head can feel heavy or very light, my eyes often feel like they’re not keeping up properly, almost like there’s a delay. I frequently get a strange feeling in my head with blurry vision. I also constantly feel “drunk” in a way — not spinning vertigo, but more like nothing ever feels fully stable.\n\nOver the past few weeks, things have gotten much worse. I’ve had palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. My mother had a heart attack two months ago, and since then I’ve been extremely focused on my heart, which has made my fears much stronger.\n\nI feel unwell all day, every day. I often feel like I could faint or die at any moment, like my body is always on the edge of something happening. This feeling is terrifying and never really goes away. Sometimes it feels like everything is going too fast in my head, like my brain might shut down. Even small sensations, like tingling in my leg, can trigger intense panic.\n\nMy vision really bothers me. I see blurry in the distance, and if I stare at my phone for a while and then look around, everything feels off and very uncomfortable. I don’t feel “out of my body”, but I constantly feel unwell in my head and in my vision. I feel slightly safer when lying down and much worse when standing or moving.\n\nI also have a constant fear — almost an intuition — that I’m going to die. This thought has been there every day for about a month, even though I rationally know my medical tests are normal.\n\nI’ve had many exams over the years: brain MRI, cerebral CT angiography, spinal MRI, ECGs, blood tests, and I’ve seen a cardiologist, neurologist, ENT, and done vision therapy. Everything has always come back normal. On paper that’s reassuring, but mentally it doesn’t stop the thoughts, especially since these tests are spread out over almost 10 years. Only my brain and spinal MRIs are recent (about six months ago). A week ago I went to the ER for palpitations and had an ECG and blood tests, which were normal, but the reassurance didn’t last because no heart ultrasound or CT scan was done.\n\nI really struggle to let go, because it feels dangerous not to pay attention to my body.\n\nI’m posting here to ask if others have experienced similar long-term issues: constant malaise, near-fainting sensations, strange vision, with no medical cause found. I’d really like to hear other people’s experiences and know if anxiety alone can truly cause all of this, because I have a very hard time believing it.

The more noticeable symptoms, which I realize tend to appear more often at night, include dizziness, a heavy-headed sensation, chills (especially in my legs), and cold sweats. My nights have become quite distressing; I notice that the symptoms intensify when I am about to fall asleep or 1–2 hours after I fall asleep.\n\nI went to the doctor and had a complete blood test, as well as an ECG, and everything came back normal.\n\nI recently started my PhD and also began therapy last month. I am concerned about how much longer I will be able to cope with this, as it has been taking away my peace of mind and affecting what I consider most sacred: my night’s sleep.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar, or is currently going through this?

For many people with anxiety, sleep becomes a trigger rather than a source of relief. Distractions, noise, movement, and responsibilities all occur throughout the day. Everything quiets down at night, giving your brain the opportunity to let go of everything it has been holding back. So as soon as you get into bed, your mind goes into overdrive. The fact that your brain does not feel safe enough to shut down is particularly important. Sleep necessitates a sense of security and letting go.

Also another reason in games i cant even get mad at people much because i think it doesnt matter what you do we all will die and it makes me feel sad for them instead of enjoying the game.\n\nThe only thing thats been helping tbh is reading these anxiety and maybe like sometimes i get like 20 minutes of calm.\n\nI havent seen a doctor i havent listed symptoms so i really dont know if it all can be anxiety because im scared i wont be able to join the military when my future depends on it.\n\nI also have some slight discomfort feelings in my head on the left dont know if that could be related to stress\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far and if i ever do get better i will come back to here.\n\nalso if you need me to clarify just reply and ask my brain is usually scattered like this and im not good at explaining ", "score": 1, "num_comments": 9, "created_utc": 1767996447.0, "id": "1q8lwut", "author": "ImpactNo2592", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q8lwut/what_do_i_do/"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "This is a lot to carry, and honestly everything you’re describing lines up really closely with how anxiety shows up for a lot of people, especially when there’s a big life change coming. The constant breathing awareness, chest heat, dizziness, weakness, being exhausted even after sleeping, appetite dropping, all of that is super common when your nervous system is stuck on high alert. The mental side too, the fear of death, aging, getting stuck like this forever, suddenly feeling different about games or things you used to enjoy, that’s also very typical anxiety stuff. It doesn’t mean you’ve changed as a person or that something bad is happening to your brain. Anxiety can make you hyper-aware of your body and your thoughts, and once that loop starts it feeds itself.  The fact that reading other posts gives you moments of calm is actually a big sign this is anxiety driven. Anxiety can absolutely feel nonstop for weeks and still calm down, even though it doesn’t feel like it right now. You’re not weak for feeling this, and it doesn’t mean your future is ruined. One small thing that sometimes helps is gently shifting attention back to the present when your mind goes to the “end of the road” thoughts, like noticing what’s around you or what your body is touching. You’re not alone in this at all, and a lot of people who felt exactly like this did get back to feeling normal again.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767997382.0, "id": "nyoj4nf", "author": "Difficult_Tie_8427"}

It took a lot of uncomfortable moments and unlearning a bunch of stuff my brain had convinced me was true. The biggest shift was realizing the feelings themselves couldn’t hurt me, so I stopped trying to control them and let them do their thing. After they passed, I’d tell myself, okay, that was just uncomfortable, not dangerous. Over time my body started learning that these sensations weren’t a threat.

The panic, adrenaline, tight chest, all of that is your system trying to protect you, not hurt you. When you don’t react with fear or resistance, your brain slowly learns that there’s no threat here. It doesn’t calm down instantly, but it starts backing off. That’s how the adrenaline cycle breaks. It’s more about retraining your nervous system than fixing yourself.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Hello, that zoned out and autopilot feeling sounds like dissociation. That happens from stress. Anxiety often causes it. It's harmless. It cannot progress into anything. \n\nAnd you can help it. I just explained it to someone, so I can copy it here: You need to understand that at the core it's from having low tolerance of uncertainty. That results in your fight or flight being triggered very easilly. That's what causes anxiety. The anxiety then causes the need to do something about it to make it stop. For example making sure how what you're afraid of isn't going to happen or to somehow get away from what you're afraid of. And when you do that, you further reinforce your low tolerance of uncertainty. It works like addiction. Do you understand the logic of this? It's improtant to understand it.\n\nAnd the radical acceptance technique. That means telling yourself how if what you're afraid of happens, it's fine. As if you don't care. No matter how terrible it would actually be. Being like \"So what?\" about it. This works as outsmarting the fear.\n\nAt all times you should let the feeling of anxiety to come and stay, not try to resist it or distract yourself from it.\n\nAlso it's crucial you get enough sleep regularly, that affects anxiety a lot. Also ideally no caffeine if you drink any.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767994968.0, "id": "nyoajdy", "author": "AntonioVivaldi7"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "My year long very physical recovery journey.", "text": "The recovery stories people had posted on Reddit were really helpful to my recovery journey so I want to contribute and hopefully help someone else.\n\nLast year, I had a pretty extreme health scare. I was cleared and sent home, and told to just follow up with a neurologist but they thought it was likely triggered by stress or anxiety. The thing is, I was so shaken by this event I ended up bedridden. I would wake up with my shoulders up to my ears and my jaw so tight opening my eyes was painful. I had unimaginably real pain throughout my body. Urinary issues, muscle spasms, weakness and floppiness. I couldn’t understand how I had so many tests done and they came back fine. It seemed like something was wrong with my brain. So, for the entire day I would stay cooped up on my phone researching health issues. Within the last few months, I had experienced numerous health problems. One of which was vertigo, another was pain in my ears and I was convinced I had some sort of undiagnosed, serious illness.\n\nMy PCP then sent me to vestibular physical therapy. It helped a lot, after the first session I felt a dramatic improvement in my vertigo and overall lightheadedness. I originally thought I was suffering from a condition, but the physical therapist explained to me that my shoulders were tense and my head was locked in an odd position. My vertigo was likely caused by a combination of anxiety and my nervous system being stuck in a loop of fear and worry. That was when I decided I needed to start addressing that maybe these symptoms were a result of my poor mental health. Maybe, my super impressive “drive” and need to always be busy was actually just anxiety.\n\nAfter this, I started researching more about the physical impact of anxiety. My facial pain? It wasn’t a life altering nerve issue it was me grinding my teeth from stress. My floppy arms? I was getting so nervous I would shake and go weak, not a heart attack. My vertigo? Poor posture and a physical response to being outside around people, not broken ears… I even ended up with chronic tension headaches from crappy posture due to stress. \n\nThat is why I want to underscore this post with something my therapist told me: Anxiety can be sneaky because we are usually told it’s a nervy tummy at most. It is not, chronic stress and anxiety can make you very physically sick and the only way to address it is by breaking the loop of worry, dread, and expectations.\n\nWith this in the back of my mind. I became committed to recovery and I did these things:\n\n1. Got professional help from a psychiatrist and a therapist. I did this when I realised the holistic at-home approach of vitamins and meditation wasn’t working. I wasn’t afraid to shop around for a therapist/psychiatrist that I liked and helped me\n\n2. Ate well. Cut out caffeine.\n\n3. Stopped googling symptoms. Took my therapist advice to accept symptoms of anxiety and not fight them. I also uninstalled TikTok. These apps see you engage with content about health scares and keep you on their app (so that you see more advertisements, end up hooked) but showing you more and more. I intend to completely cut out social media to see how this helps!\n\n4. Quit my job. Focused on school.\n\n5. Started medication. I know it is still a point of contention for a lot of people but it was that thing that helped me push myself to get out of bed. It is not something that fixed anxiety or depression, it just helped me commit to my recovery.\n\n6. Started getting regular massages and doing yoga to help with muscle tension. Moving is crucial to recovery. Meditation is also great.\n\n7. Pushed myself to not challenge anxious thoughts, but say “don’t care. Today and tomorrow aren’t guaranteed. I will do what makes me happy”\n\n8. And then pushed myself to alter my internal monologue into something more positive and happy. I can do this, it is rarely ever the end of the world, life is meant to be enjoyed.\n\n9. Let myself be myself. Dressing the way I want, getting a haircut that makes me feel comfortable, stuff like that!\n\nNow, I hope this list helps you a bit, but what I found most helpful was finding myself and discovering what actually gave me meaning in life. I began putting faith into the world, and allowing myself to have less control over my life. When doubt enters my mind, I remind myself that being a kind person and being happy is all I can do. Everything else is out of my control and so I should cherish every moment. I think the main part of recovery is allowing yourself to feel joy and peace by doing things slowly, abandoning the constant need to be doing something/be productive, and enjoying life knowing that it is unpredictable. \n\nAnxiety thrives off of keeping you stagnant, keeping your brain locked up in a cycle of fear. I feel I starved my anxiety by caring for myself and being kind to my mind and body. What makes anxiety so scary is that part of the process of recovery is handing over control to the world and accepting that uncertainty is just a part of life and kind of what makes living so great. I was bedridden with anxiety, there is no exaggeration when I say that. I remember going to the mall and almost fainting from vertigo and nausea from just being around other people. I am now at a stage where I can run to the store if need be or make a spontaneous stop to a friend’s house. I still have a long way to go, but I feel so fortunate to still be here after such a tough battle with my mental health. I hope that if you are in a position where you feel stuck, and recovery especially from the physical symptoms feels never ending that you know you will make it and you will come out of this so strong!  \n", "score": 4, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767992790.0, "id": "1q8kbu8", "author": "Hopeful_Wonder_1167", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q8kbu8/my_year_long_very_physical_recovery_journey/"}

I have felt for some time she wasn't a right fit for me. I think I need more intensive therapy for people with trauma, while I'm essentially in only talk therapy. Its my first therapist as an adult and it's taken some time for me to realize it isn't working. I recently started couples therapy through her office. I expressed to my couples therapist that I was feeling off about my personal therapist and how she has been handling my therapy (trying to get me to leave my partner, telling me I'm too weak to set boundaries with people in my life, giving absolutely no advice some sessions at all, telling me to just stop being anxious). My couples therapist sympathized with me and I expressed concern and anxiety knowing my private therapist is essentially her boss. She reassured me and told me it was confidential and it wouldn't leave the room/call, and that she would help me find a new therapist. Christmas happened and my therapy was pushed weeks until today.\n\nMy session went normally for about 40 minutes, she allowed me to talk for 40 minutes before interrogating me. I was finished talking about what happened and my therapist said to me \"I could help you but you told \\*other therapist\\* you're uncomfortable with me and what I say about your partner and mother, so I'm not comfortable giving you advice anymore\" she told me my couples therapist told her everything I had mentioned. She also said \"you just talked for 40 minutes about how awful your mother is, i could give you adviice but unfortunately I'm uncomfortable since you have an issue with the things i say\" She then proceeded to gaslight me on things she said about my partner, saying she doesn't have an opinion about people she doesn't know (my partner) but in the past she's called him an asshole and told me to leave him and that he isn't going to get better. Now she's saying she never said that and that everyone can get better. I said that I never mentioned anything to my couples therapist about my mom or what my private therapist says about my family, she said that I was basically a liar and that my couples therapist said the opposite. And that they shared things I told the both of them about my partner.\n\nShe proceeded to schedule me like normal next week and I'm now at home crying and writing this. I've actually never felt more anxious before. It felt like I was going to throw up in the office. \n\nAm I making a big deal out of this?

Sometimes anxiety happens with an endocrine disorder. Sleep disorders also which initially cause anxiety then a couple of years later, fatigue sets in. \n\nOne can still have sleep apnea or UARS even if trim and fit, even if sleeping the usual 7 hours. Anyone would begin to lose it with getting less oxygen during sleep. Or just restless legs syndrome, there are a few sleep disorders causing an unrestorative sleep. It's even possible to get schizo like symptoms but not true schizophrenia if this goes on too long untreated. Sleep is the time for the brain to repair and restore itself. \n\nMore trouble mornings with both endo and sleep disorders and anything medical really because cortisol is the highest the first hour of the day (it begins to rise half way through sleep). Easier to feel nervous and pace. Cortisol is the lowest at night, but with some conditions, the mind races before bed since it's more difficult to fall asleep and really, the body becomes afraid to fall asleep knowing what's going to happen. REM, the dream stage is when we work out daily stress too. \n\nCortisol is the stress hormone, more adrenaline too happens when it's high. Lofta at home but an in-clinic sleep study is better to catch all sleep disorders. Endocrine full panel blood tests. Many PCPs and family doctors don't consider sleep disorders. Many doctors only do TSH blood tests not the full thyroid panel (also there is cortisol, ACTH, etc). A heart holter monitor is worth trying if you're older since cardiac reasons happen more. Smart watches are not really accurate for heart, oxygen levels, sleep patterns but a clue.   \n\nWith any anxiety reason, small problems become magnified and harder to cope with; but, it's a good idea to explore more physical body medical reasons first before jumping to a mental health disorder. Talk therapy helps to cope in the meantime. \n\nGood luck with your investigations and path to recovery!", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767986440.0, "id": "nynfr5o", "author": "erika_nyc"}

All my tests are normal.\nI’ve seen a lot of doctors, but still don’t have a clear answer, so I’m looking for people with similar experiences.\n\nMain symptoms:\n\n- constant thirst\n\n- dry mouth and dry lips\n\n- feeling like water doesn’t really quench my thirst\n\n- because of that, I drink a lot (around 4–4.5 liters / ~1–1.2 gallons per day), which leads to frequent urination\n\n\nSleep is a separate issue.\nI fall asleep easily, but about 4 hours after falling asleep I wake up, probably because of thirst and the need to go to the toilet. The problem is that I don’t fully wake up. I stay in this half-awake, very shallow sleep state until morning. By the time I’m actually awake, it’s already time to get up.\nAs a result, I don’t get proper, restorative sleep, and this has been going on for many months. It’s really exhausting.\n\nWhat doctors and tests have ruled out:\n\n- diabetes mellitus\n\n- kidney issues (ultrasound + labs are normal)\n\n- electrolyte imbalances (but recently I learned that test results can be normal, yet someone may still benefit from additional electrolytes, so I'm experiment with that) \n\n- autoimmune causes\n\n- endocrinologists consider diabetes insipidus clinically unlikely\n\n\nSo basically, no organic cause has been found despite long-term testing.\n\nOver the past 10 years, I’ve had similar episodes of constant thirst and frequent urination before. But back then, they didn’t last long, didn’t affect my sleep, and went away on their own.\n\nAt this point, all doctors keep referring me to psychotherapists, saying it’s related to anxiety, stress, nerves, etc.\n\nSince about a year I've actually been going through an existential crisis and depression, and since around that time these symptoms appeared and have been gradually intensifying month by month.\n\nI’ve seen two psychotherapists so far. Both say this is a somatoform disorder related to anxiety and depression. At the same time, they openly admit that they haven’t had patients with exactly the same presentation as mine, which honestly makes me less confident in the treatment plans they suggested.\n\nThe first doctor prescribed: Gidazepam (anxiolytic / benzodiazepine tranquilizer) + Quetiapine (atypical antipsychotic).\n\nThe second doctor prescribed: Phenazepam (benzodiazepine tranquilizer) + an SSRI antidepressant.\n\nI’ve heard about the risks of dependence and withdrawal with these meds. And since I’m a bit of an anxious / cautious person already, plus the fact that these doctors don’t have direct experience with cases like mine, I’ve been hesitant to start taking them.\n\nFinding a really good doctor is difficult in my city, it’s always been a problem here. That’s why I'm here. Sometimes I get more helpful advices on the internet than from docs. \n\nI’d really like to hear from people who’ve been in a similar situation.\n\nWas anxiety or stress actually the root cause for you?\n\nDid you try antidepressants or anti-anxiety meds?\n\nWhat helped you specifically?\n\n\nI’d really appreciate any shared experiences.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767961377.0, "id": "1q86vxh", "author": "danick_bmf", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q86vxh/constant_thirst_normal_test_results_32m/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Performance anxiety triggers your nervous system into fight or flight. The shaky voice and breathlessness happen because your body floods with adrenaline and cortisol, preparing for a threat, even though the \"threat\" is just speaking in class. When anxiety is manageable outside of school, that points to context-specific triggers. The classroom environment itself activates survival responses, likely because past experiences involved judgment or embarrassment. Your body remembers even if you don't consciously recall specifics. The anticipation is often worse than the actual moment. The pit in your stomach grows as your brain replays worst-case scenarios and your nervous system stays activated. The pit in your stomach grows because your brain is replaying worst-case scenarios and your nervous system stays activated waiting for the perceived threat. Distraction works in the short term, but it doesn't address the underlying activation. Grounding techniques help when you notice the anxiety building: focus on physical sensations (feet on floor, hands on desk), name five things you can see, four you can touch. This pulls attention away from the mental spiral and signals safety to your body. For participation anxiety, prepare something brief beforehand. Have a few go-to responses ready so you're not caught off guard. Practice saying them out loud at home so your voice doesn't feel foreign when you speak in class. Start small: answer one question per class, even if it's just confirming something. Each time you participate without disaster, you're retraining your nervous system that the classroom is safe. Medication can help if the anxiety is severe enough to interfere with learning, but therapy that addresses the specific triggers is often more effective long term. Many people find that working through performance anxiety requires addressing the underlying beliefs about judgment and failure. There are structured methods for processing these fear responses that can help separate the anxiety from your identity and reduce the physical activation over time.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767945966.0, "id": "nyk7f7b", "author": "zakhere78"}

But people wondered \"but hang on this quantum behaviour isn't in a vacuum it applies to all things\" so people then wonder that since there are universes where you die how do you know that the path consciousness always follows is the one in which you are not dead, after all you cannot be aware of being dead. But that means you have already died loads of times, that near miss, the near fatal accidents, they will only ever be nearly fatal.\n\nBut the reason that is scary is because the universe might not care about quality of life, just that the awareness keeps continuing as long as it is possible in whatever state...potentially forever.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767949095.0, "id": "nykd78g", "author": "Minimum_Orange2516"}

Continuity only matters to an observer who remembers the break and in no way would our memories survive the death of the brain anyway, which I view as a blessing actually. I don't want to remember this life or what I could have missed after I am gone either way. This is why it's so important to remind your loved ones how much you love them while they and you are alive, because my memory of them will vanish forever regardless and it won't bother me that I don't remember them. There is no getting around the urgency of it, because death can happen to us at any moment, but having anxiety about it is ultimately pointless and a waste of so so precious time.

I even encountered people with anxiety and they told me the same thing “get over it”.\n\n\n Several years ago I was diagnosed with OCD and GAD additionally MDD. These past two-three years it seemed like I developed a social phobia and I’ve isolated myself from the outside world. I’ve been anxious since I was a small child but it progressively worsened through my teen years and now as an adult I’ve completely shut myself from the world.\n\n\n Sometime ago I used to see a psychiatrist, and they prescribed me all sorts of medication to improve my depression, anxiety, etc. I had my dosage increase, I switched to another medication because it felt like the previous one wasn’t effective. At some point it felt like it made my mental health worse so I quit.\n\n\n One day I decided to attend a class at my local community college to improve my “anxiety”, it was a small and quiet campus but every morning I woke up I would feel anxious, sometimes I would jolt up in a panic. I would feel nauseous during my morning routine which I tried to keep low pressure. During the lecture I would start dissociating and I end up not actually gaining any information. \n\n\n A while back I decided to walk around an outdoor shopping mall and I just zone out walking aimlessly. Sometimes when I fight my anxiety, I become extremely scared, muscle tension, my temperature feels like it's rising, I can’t think properly and my thoughts are racing.  \n\n\nA couple days ago I got into an argument with my Mother that I couldn't do an interview and I'm terrified of working because of my anxiety. She told me that I have to try new things and get out of the house.\n\n\nI’m worried that it will worsen my depression being in an environment that is overwhelming. I'm anxious about dealing with customers or people that might humiliate, embarrass, or see me as someone incompetent or slow because of my learning disability and just generally someone dumb.\n\n\nWhat if I dissociate or am overwhelmed and I can’t complete tasks properly? What if I can process instructions clearly? I keep having endless intrusive thoughts about it. \n\n\nAnyway I told myself that this year I’ll take small steps, and set goals that are actually reachable like taking a walk around the neighborhood once a week for example. \n\n\nIs it possible to get over anxiety? Two years ago I was proud of myself for being able to go to the grocery store on my own and purchase something without panicking and breaking down crying because everything felt terrifying and overwhelming. \n\nP.S sorry for this being long, I guess I had a lot on my chest\n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1767936150.0, "id": "1q7zolx", "author": "FoolishlyTruth", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q7zolx/is_it_possible_to_get_over_anxiety/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Heart Palpitations", "text": "Hello everyone. Sorry in advance for asking questions that have probably been asked many times.\n\nI am 25M and have dealt with mental health problems for as long as I can remember. This is not really surprising to me as mental health issues are very common within my immediate family and seemingly from quite a bit of my extended family on both parents sides. I deal with what is in my opinion considered pretty extreme anxiety, as well as bad depression and panic issues. These issues have always impacted my life heavily, but it wasn't until about 5 years ago, shortly after turning 20 that everything took an abrupt turn that causes my life to be completely taken over by my mental health struggles. I'm not going to type out every mental and physical symptom I have had/have to deal with on a daily basis as that would make this an extremely long post. I know a lot of us in this group unfortunately have their own lists that seem to go on forever. \n\nSo the turning point started in early 2021, I was up playing video games way too late as I have always had bad insomnia issues, it had to of been around 3 or 4am. I will say I was playing some intense video games and all of a sudden I started to feel very weird, and for some reason I went to check my heart(that was not a typical thing I did) and I felt nothing. I am quite a skinny guy so usually I can always feel my heartbeat very well. When I had my hand on my chest and felt nothing it was like I was instantly paralyzed in fear, and then all of a sudden my whole body kind of jerked and I could feel my heart rate again and it skyrocketed to insane speeds. It's hard to fully remember everything about that night but I felt like I was dying, and thought I was. I proceeded to have what would best be described as a panic attack with extreme heart rate, frequent skipped beats, and at times my heart rate seeming off rhythm for almost a week straight without stopping. I could barely get out of bed to use the bathroom. With time I was able to function again but the heart palpitations have never stopped. That is what this post is primarily about as I'm extremely worried about my heart health and still after all these years am convinced I have serious heart problems. \n\nI'm aware I should've gone to a cardiologist years ago when this all started, but at the time covid was at it's peak and I didn't want to go to a hospital, as well as my mom convincing me it was just anxiety and it would go away with time. With the issues continuing and putting off going to a hospital, it made me deathly afraid of getting checked out so I still have never been to a docdoctor. For the past year or so I have overcame that fear to the point that I want to get checked out, but have not had health insurance. I have gone in to an urgent care once where they ran an ekg and said nothing seemed off on that but referred me to go to a cardiologist for further testing. Without insurance though I was not able to actually see the specialist. I have finally just gotten insurance yesterday through my new job and will be setting up some appointments but I also am aware that getting in to see a cardiologist can sometimes take months so I'm hoping someone can ease my mind and help convince me something isn't seriously wrong, well other than with my mental health or course lol.\n\nI deal with palpitations on a daily basis,  ranging from minor little ones I barely feel to intense ones that seem to rock my chest and make me cough and jolt. In the past 5 years I've had maybe a few days palpitation free. What worries me the most is what seems to cause the palpitations. They can happen from absolutely nothing, but they also seem to happen from physically exerting myself anytime I try to, and very often from very minorly physically exerting myself such as walking a short distance(10 minutes) or lifting a small ammount of weight(30 pounds). I have not ran or done any serious exercise since all of this started as it terrified me. What also seems to cause them is certain positions, leaning back too much causes them almost every time. Also laying on my left side causes them. I can lay on my back most of the time, but even then I have to lay on my right side for a little while first. Laying on my right side seems to be the only safe option most of the time. When I first lay down I also have to have my head elevated more than typical for the first 10 or so minutes, then it is usually is okay. I also can't bend over without having bad palpitatiojs most of the time. This has made life extremely difficult. What convinced my brain that the palpitations themselves aren't from my mental health issues are that physical exertion cause them and also the specific positions that cause them every time. They are terrifying as I know they are for a lot of people, and I get the violent ones very very often. If these things can truly be caused by anxiety then how do specific positions cause them? I know this all probably sounds very stupid, but I am currently in kind of a freakout mode. I have also probably left a lot out as my mind is jumbled but I will answer any questions people have.\n\nI'm sorry for how long this post is and I thank anyone for sharing their thoughts/knowledge.

Especially if your EKG came back fine you’ll be ok.\n\nPoint is that the mind is powerful and since those of us with Health anxiety are ultra aware of every single sensation with our bodies we go out looking for something that could be wrong with us. Truth is that we’re tricking our nervous systems into thinking something is wrong when it really isn’t.\n\nConsidering you’ve seen doctors and told you that ur fine it’s best to trust them even tho it seems impossible to believe that your ok. \n\nDon’t really have much advice other than that tho cuz I regularly struggle with health anxiety and palpitations but know that ur not the only one that’s felt these symptoms.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Hi, I’ve had a similar story. I actually went to dental school. I’m a dentist in Missouri. And I started having a heart palpitations after dental school due to high anxiety and overstimulated stress in addition to taking too many monster energy drinks, diet, Mountain Dew‘s and coffees and not enough water no sleep three hours a night studying for tests that never end so it definitely was stress and anxiety that created a perfect storm along with a lack of sleep, but then you ask yourself. How do you get sleep when you can’t get your heart to calm down first things first make sure to see the heart specialist to make sure you don’t have any weak valves or any extenuating stretchy blood vessels that can cause complications second know that if you get good anxiety medicine, it will help the palpitations if it’s purely anxiety third make sure to be drinking a water amount that is beyond what you think is the right amount like literally drinking a jug of water a day is not enough because all the electrical imbalance is in your heart, require water and proper sodium potassium and calcium to effectively balance the channels that caused heart contraction making sure you have enough for electrolytes such as Gatorade actually is really important because that has to do with heart contraction next if your heart structure is healthy after seeing your specialist make sure to do a good amount of weightlifting and Biking to strengthen your heart that will reduce the palpitations. That’s why when you get palpitation some doctors will tell you to bear down like you’re trying to use the restroom and really pressure your heart such as if your weightlifting have your weights but only do this if you’ve checked out that there’s no weak heart structures when you’ve talk to your specialist last make sure to cut out all major, stimulants, energy drinks, nicotine caffeine weed, vaping anything that can stimulate the electrical portion of your heart. Also keep in mind Covid with or without the vaccine and the vaccine both have been known to cause palpitations so if it’s either of those things, they should actually improve overtime and then they’ll come back again when you get sick or something stimulates the spike proteins from either Covid or the vaccine that is supposed to mimic Covid but it will get better than the more you exercise and balance out electrolytes water, and sleep better. it will get better. Also make sure to pray and spend time with God asking him for clarity and peace and what avenues to take for improving the palpitations medically spiritually physically mentally.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Unexplainable Physical Symptoms", "text": "To preface, I am 20M. I’ve always had some form of anxiety or depression in the past, that I’m sure of, and have always seemed to have pretty persistent headaches that never really went away fully, and my muscles have always seemed tense. But this year, it’s felt like on another level, and it’s genuinely terrifying.\n\nStarting around 7 months ago, I started to feel lightheaded when I was at work, and also came with a really specific sinking feeling, a little bit in my stomach but weirdly mostly in my head. At first I thought it was simply me being dehydrated, but when I drank water and woke up the next morning and it was still there, I knew something was up. Then I started to get other symptoms: first it was brain fog, then the feeling of being off-balance, then I started to feel what I thought was sinus pressure, or at least fairly intense pressure in the middle of my head or nosebridge. After that, I started to have vertigo, or at least a kind where every time I would move my head fast it would disorient me. That’s the best way I can describe it. And then I started to have vision problems, almost like double vision but not, I knew I didn’t have it but it still felt weird. All of that developed within a week or so.\n\nI tried so many things, I got a new prescription on my glasses (didn’t work, still don’t wear them because they make things worse) and I even went to urgent care twice, got told both times that it was likely sinus issues and got prescribed anti inflamitory medication the first time and antibiotics the second, which didn’t work. Saw my PCD, same thing and was prescribed antibiotics. I even got lab work done twice, and my results were fairly normal, nothing justifying the symptoms I had at least. Only thing mildly for concern was my bilirubin. Just doing research would send me into a spiral, though, and make me believe I had every condition listed. Eventually, I learned to live with it and even though it was annoying, it became a new “normal” of sorts, though I wished it would go away every day.\n\nFast forward to now, and my symptoms got better. I didn't feel the off-balance sensation as much and it was mainly the “vertigo”, slight brain fog and a sinking feeling sometimes but recently, around a few days ago, the off-balance sensation came back in full swing, along with another symptom happening multiple times today.\n\nThe only way I can describe it was as a “hum” or vibration in my head (that I can’t hear but feel) and it’s the one of the worst things I’ve felt. It feels like I can hardly think when it comes on and lasts a few seconds, and then lingers for about a minute or so. I’ve heard people describe something similar like brain zaps but I’m not sure it’s that since I’ve never been on any medication or smoked weed or tobacco or anything.\n\nI just want to know if there’s any solution to this issue, I haven’t felt like myself in months and I just want my life back. I’m so scared it could be chronic or life-threatening, but I’ve been told by pretty much everyone I know it’s not that serious. It might not be, but it’s really harming my mental health and overall life enjoyment. It feels so hard to enjoy life right now, and finding a solution or answer is all I really want, or at the very least knowing someone else is out there who’s been here before. I don't even know it's anxiety, but I'm getting anxious just thinking about it.\n\nEdit: Added additional details about labwork.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1767928573.0, "id": "1q7x26i", "author": "Cheaper-Pitch-9498", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q7x26i/unexplainable_physical_symptoms/"}

Thank you.\n\nI have always dealt with general anxiety disorder. I’ve learned to live with it and control it up until about the last year and a half. I started school and moved to a new city. Changed everything. I panicked/continue to panic over everything. Will I be able to pay rent. Then what happens if I can’t pay rent. What happens if my car breaks down and I can’t get to work to pay rent. What happens when I get evicted. Now I’m in debt with no car, roof, or money. Then my girlfriend will break up with me. I know it’s not true but these thoughts don’t stop.\n\nBut it’s not just money. I live alone in an apartment. Away from my loved ones, not far, but far enough that I’m away. It’s this pit in my stomach feeling, that I’ll never see them again, this sense of dread that I’m in danger. I just want to get in my car and go back home. But then the thought of having to come back eats me the whole time I’m at home that I can’t enjoy it so I just try to get back to see if I can make it work back at my apartment. The fear of being alone is exhausting. I hate being alone.\n\nThen there’s school. What if I fail a class, and what if I retake the class and can’t pass, then I can’t get my degree, then all of this money and time wasted and in debt with nothing to show for it. I’ll be a loser. \n\nThe constant what if scenarios are eating away at me, I can’t live with this knot in my stomach forever. My family and loved ones are supportive, they try to understand but I don’t think they do.\n\nI just want to get in my car and drive. I want to just run away from this.\n\nI’m on Lexapro but it’s not working or not a high enough dose. Please I need someone to give me any advice. I need someone to relate to how I’m feeling. I need someone besides my family to just tell me it’ll work out and be okay.

I’ve been through a lot of stress lately where it always felt like I had a lump in my throat. I’ve had some days where I feel fine but the anxiety never left my body.\n\nOne night I was totally distracted and I just felt a sense of doom and my heart has been feeling weird, so I took a second to go to the bathroom to calm down since my partner was sleeping and it was out of the blue for no reason.\n\nThese past few days have been good for me. I haven’t had any stressors and I’ve actually been happy because I’m ovulating again and we get to move to a new place.\n\nToday, it’s a dull ache on upper left side of chest, feeling like I need my inhaler and coughing because it feels like something is stuck in my throat in a sense, but keep drinking water and no improvement. Very very dull throbbing pain has lasted since 10:20am and it’s 12:26 now. I have asthma and an inhaler but have never needed it really unless I do exercise, so this is quite random.\n\nAround 6pm at work I stood up to do something and after 30 seconds my chest hurt really bad physically. It felt so tight and the pain was throbbing. It made me feel a bit dizzy and I had to sit down. It calmed down after 10 minutes. It hurt so much to breathe in for no reason.\n\nAround 9:00pm it happened again. I started shivering and then the pain came on slowly, hurting to breathe in again, feeling like the breath is being taken out of my lungs. \n\nI’m wondering if my body is recovering?

Him moving out was super tough on me, I was crying like everyday non stop and was terrified for how lonely I would be without him. I eventually went back to college late august which helped distract and ease the transition for me, however it’s still been pretty quiet at the house with just my sister and my mom. My mom unfortunately suffered a stroke so there’s some things that she needs help with (like walking the dogs) which I don’t mind to do but with my siblings home the tasks were more spread out and manageable (everything felt easier and less serious).\n\n\nBack to now: I’m on winter break and i’m heading to London to study abroad but honestly I’m not super excited to go. While i’m gone my childhood house will be put on the market and most likely sold, and my sister plans on moving out in July potentially taking the dogs with her (i still have one more year of college so she would have to take them so she could walk them). I’m struggling so badly coping with this. I don’t see my sister much now but I know that once she moves out i’m probably not going to see her at all besides thanksgiving. Even though she won’t be more than a 30 minute drive from me when she moves out (due to her job location) i know i still won’t see her often. I feel i really attached to my family especially not having many friends in my hometown compared to my college town. I’m devastated about selling my house, my dad passed and it holds a lot of memories for me. I’m also terrified about where i’m gonna end up and what this new house holds for me and my mom. I know things can’t stay the same forever, and I know even if they magically did I would probably hate it, I can’t help but feel so much anxiety, grief, and sadness about it. I’m supposed to feel excited going to study abroad but all I feel is dread for the future. I’m coming back to a new house (potentially i don’t even know if me and my mom have to live in an apartment for a while), my sister moving out shortly after and taking my dogs with her, and soon in a year i’ll be graduating college with no idea on what I want to do with my life. I cannot stop spiralling for the life of me. All i keep thinking about is the future and stressing out over what’s going to happen. I’m having a really difficult time dealing with all this uncertainty at once and i’ve talked to people about it but nothing is really helping. \n\nIf anyone has gone through a similar experience or has any advice I would take it happily.

In mid August my doses were 1mg clonazepam per day, and 1.5-2.0mg alprazolam every 2-3 days for emergency use against panic attacks. These are the amounts I've taken for well over ten years.\n\nIn mid October (after going completely without for a while because of having to change doctors) clonazepam was completely eliminated and alprazolam was reduced to ten 0.5mg tablets a month. (Two months later she reduces that to 8 tablets a month but I'll get back to that.) I was given propranolol to replace what was taken, and I'm in agony every day. Does this sound like a sensible taper? Should this be reduced that fast? Oh, and if I my panic attacks get severe I'm supposed to hold an ice cube in one hand while I'm sniffing lavender oil out of a Kleenex in the other hand. And no, I'm not joking.\n\nBefore I forget, I was previously taking hydroxyzine for my nose (though I preferred Benadryl) and I'm allowed to use that for panic, not that it does anything.\n\nI may have a clue, though, and I hope to God that it is actually a clue because it just might save my butt. In preparing to make a complaint to the patient advocacy office of her medical group I was checking over appointment notes. In the meeting notes from out first appointment, she wrote that I had previously been taking 0.5 (¼ of a 2mg tab) every 2-3 days. This is 100% incorrect. Also, last month she reduced me from 10 0.5mg tablets a month to 8, and I'm thinking like, uh she already took most of my medication away from me why would she care about two tablets. If she wrote this down wrong, imthat might explain why she would reduce by 1mg for a month (not per day, per month).\n\nThis IS one of those \"I will never prescribe Xanax to anyone\" type of doctors who treats Xanax as something worse than the panic disorder it fights, and wants it completely eliminated off the face of the earth. She was nice (heh) enough to give me a small fraction of my Xanax to help me taper off. She also likes to consider herself superior to pretty much all other doctors and doesn't listen to anything, and wants to congratulate herself and taper IN ANTICIPATION OF a presumed success rather than any actual success not that she's given me anything other than propranolol to be proud of herself for.\n\nTL;dr Is going from my initial dose to nothing for a bit to a small fraction all over just a couple of months even safe?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767917032.0, "id": "1q7sm7m", "author": "NoPoopOnFace", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q7sm7m/safely_weaning_from_benzos/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "From hell to light - drug induced panic disorder", "text": "Hello, \n\nI've been getting a lot of messages about how I overcame my panic disorder, so i decided to write a detailed story about my 5 months in hell. I (29M) am from East Europe so some things may be different, than from your culture.\n\n**Intro**\n\nFor 1 year I've been using Speed (Amphetamines) or Cocaine every Friday and Saturday + Alcohol of course. I've never had any problems with anxiety before. One day I tried LSD and we were taking it every weekend (6 weeks). One time I was high on LSD and I had my first ever panic attack. I just stood up from couch and went to toilet and I had started to feel really intense fear. It came out of no where. It lasted 2 hour and I just focused on breathing. I thought I was having a \"bad trip\". After that I took a break from LSD for few months, but I was still doing lines on weekends. Few months after i took LSD again and everything was perfect until one moment where I got panic attack again. I said, well this drug is not for me.\n\nFast forward 2 months, I was on that same couch where I had my first panic attack, we were drinking our second beer and we were doing small lines of Cocaine. I felt tight in my chest so I skipped a line. After half hour I wanted to go home and took one cute, small, baby line and my life changed. I snorted that line and in instant moment i felt rush of some kind of energy  through my body and my ears were beeping - i think its called tinnitus on English.  \nMy heart started to pump so hard, I thought I was having heart attack. I was also having intense derealization. I was paralyzed from fear. I was feeling like I will die. It lasted for 3 hours. It was nightmare. My friend drive me home and I decided to take a break from drugs and i feel asleep.\n\nI woke up and felt dizzy and like I was in carton, like I was in some game... It's hard to explain the feeling. The whole day felt so weird. I had huge pressure in my left boobs and I was 100% sure I have some heart problems because of drugs. I was talking with a customer and suddenly I felt like i was in fast elevator while standing still, that cause me anxiety and I had panic attack. Again I was dying for 20 minutes. I left my work and I somehow drive myself to doctor and I was sitting in waiting room. While I was there i felt perfectly normal, nothing was bothering me. I went inside and talked with my doctor and told her everything and what drugs i took and she told me: \"I think you are having panic attacks\". I was like huuh? What are those? I don't think so! Something is wrong with my heart. She gave me Xannax 0.5mg (Aprazolam). She said I have to send you to mental hospital and drink Xannax sometimes if your having panic, if it helps, it's your anxiety. You are healthy. I tried Xannax next time I was having panic attack and it helped me a lot. I did some research on Xannax and I said, oh boy, im not going to drink those too much, they are so addictive!\n\n**Here the hell begins.** After few days since my visit to the doctor, I woke up with huge pressure on my chest. I felt like someone was standing on my chest (left boob). I felt  derealization (everything was cartoony), dizzines, headaches, insomnia, tinnitus, random stabbing pain, I felt like someone put rubber bands around my head above my eyebrows and my brain was numb. My throat was small, i could barley breath. I was so scared, I didn't know what was happening. Panic attacks every day. But, when I drink Xannax, everything is gone. I didn't want to drink those. Literally from the time I opened my eyes until I went to sleep I had these side effects. I didn't know what was happening.\n\n  \nI was so afraid and alone. I wanted to kill myself. I thought I got stuck in LSD trip and that my life will be until the end like this. I couldn't sleep for 2 days sometimes how scared I was. When I wanted to sleep I would have brain zapps. I would get scared (from the sound) when someone closed the car doors in front of house. It was pure hell. I couldn't work, I couldn't hang out with my friends. I would cry and cry so much because I was so afraid and I wanted to feel normal. At that time, this sounds stupid, but I noticed when i do masturbation i feel perfectly normal and then when I am done, I am back to hell. I said okay Ill go to mental hospital.\n\n(keep in mind this is East Eu) I went to mental hospital and doctor laughed at my in a way oh here is another junkie. He gave me some SSRI and I said I will not drink that. he said: Oh you can do drugs, but your afraid to take SSRI?. I said okay ill give it a chance. I took one pill of Paxil and I had the worst panic attack ever. He told me that its normal, it takes 2-3 weeks for SSRI to start working.  I threw those in garbage. He didn't explain me my situation, he just wanted me to drink pills that will \"fix\" my problem.\n\nAgain I was in hell, all those side effects from moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep my anxiety is over the roof. on lucky days it would have very high anxiety, but on bad days extreme anxiety. Helpless, depressed, tired I again was thinking about killing myself. I felt like I was being tortured alive. I felt like this was the end, I can't live like this anymore.\n\nAfter one and half months I was feeling a little better, I wasn't having panic attacks every day anymore, but the rest of symptoms were still extreme. I also wasn't having head aches anymore. But new everyday whole day symptom showed up. It was dizziness and half of my vision was blurry. My dizziness so was extreme, I felt like I was walking on a boat whole time. I was scared to walk because I felt like I was about to lose balance or consciousness.\n\n  \n**The healing begins.** I was desperate to feel better. I tried a lot of supliments like Ashwaganda, Magnesium Glycinat and so on and nothing helped.  I tried to get drunk and it worked, i felt better, but next 2 days my anxiety was extreme - not worth it!  \nI was reading about CBT and i decided to try it. I only seen her 3 times because it's expensive here. When I started to talk with that lady, it was the first time in 2 months that somebody understands me. I was so happy, somebody finally understood me!   \nshe thought me 2 things:  \n\n\n1. Anxiety is normal emotion. Your anxiety is really high and manifests itself physically.\n\n2. Challenge your fears. Example: Go to work today without Xannax pill in my wallet (I drink it maybe like once or twice a week when I was having panic attack or I could feel it coming)\n\n  \nI just accepted my anxiety and I ignored it. It was so hard, don't think that I did this in one week, It took me at least 1 month to master it. \n\nI remember walking and I was so dizzy and I just said to myself: Well, I don't care anymore If I fall. If I die, I will be at better place because this is hell!\" I was just practicing that mindset and I gave myself a lot of challenges. The hardest one was going out with my friends clubbing. Keep in mind I still feel all those symptoms i mentioned above. I said to myself while having panic attack in club: \"I don't care if i die, at least I won't die home alone, ill die here with my friends\".  \nI noticed when I changed my mindset i started to get better and better. I didn't see improvment in 2 days, it took at least one month to see it so don't be impatient!   \nThe summer came and I went to help my dad lawn the mow at our summer house. I was so focused on it that i forgot about my anxiety. I was in shock. I noticed when I am away from WIFI and flat screens and phones, my anxiety is reducing. I couldn't believe it. I started to go to solo walk in forest and focus on my breathing, i reduced my time on TV/Phone/Computer and I could feel my body healing on weekly bases! I also added some cardio and swimming and I was just spending my free time outside of house. That's it, after 5 months, my anxiety went from extreme to very low. Just changing my mindset saved me.\n\n  \nI have few words for my Anxiety community;  \nI know what you are going through. I know in what hell are you. I promise you It is not forever. I promise you that you will get better. I promise you you will not die.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767914557.0, "id": "1q7rlzz", "author": "Own_Foundation_497", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q7rlzz/from_hell_to_light_drug_induced_panic_disorder/"}

Went on for days, I checked constantly cause I felt a pulse in my sternum and flutters. Tuesday, for like the third time, I started feeling shaky randomly. Thought it was because I fasted too long (15-18 h sometimes, my meals have been kinda eh lately), so I had food, did not really get better. Next day, I went to the ER, they did a finger prick test 2h after my last meal, came back as 124 and I got sent home, no hypoglycemia. But my shakiness persists.\n\nI had very stressful two months recently, filled with ER visits, panic attacks (had like 4-5 in a span of 8 days this month alone) and lots of hypochondria. Usually, when a symptom appears or sensation, I get scared and focus on it, till it goes away, but that just makes it worse unfortunately. I had shakes during panic attacks but they were extreme jittery full body tremors. This is more subtle. Like shaking when I move my arms and hands, shaking when I get up, walk, stand. Tried to work out, my legs started shaking after the first leg raise. I even have muscle twitches everywhere, although I notice hotspots, like my hip, arms or back. It is like when you hold a sit up for too long, this is how my shakiness feels like, not really visible from the outside, if no, minimally, like internal to slight external trembling. Muscle fatigue sort of.\n\nI have been vegan for 4 months now, I am not sure, if that correlates. I do take supplements occasionally, but not strict rigorous. Found out the supplement I been taking only has 56mg Magnesium, so I started hydrating more (2,5-3l daily) and having electrolyte sachets which add 150 g of Magnesium. The fizzy tablets I used to drink had 250 mg but apparently the absorption is bad and anxiety insanely depletes your magnesium. I do not go outside much, I am too scared of a panic attack in public.

For about three and a half years, I have had two lymph nodes on the back of my head, which are symmetrical. At first, I thought they were pimples, but they have remained unchanged and can still be palpated. They are small, movable, and become painful with strong mechanical pressure. I even suspect that there is a smaller lymph node next to one of them, which is painful, movable, and less than 5 mm in size.\nAbout eleven months ago, another lymph node was discovered on my neck. It is oval, movable, and initially tender to pressure. It is only about 9 mm × 5 mm and has shown no abnormal changes since then. Six days ago, I noticed a lymph node in my groin. It was initially painful but is now only slightly palpable, flat, smooth, and movable. A few weeks ago, I had a swollen lymph node on the other side of my groin, which had a normal morphology and disappeared after about two weeks. My oncologist told me that this is anatomically normal and that he would be able to find lymph nodes on himself as well.\nPrevious examinations, including ultrasound, contrast-enhanced CT, and MRI in summer 2025, showed no pathological changes. This theoretically gives me reassurance, but my concerns remain, as I palpate every lymph node carefully and monitor for changes. This uncertainty is very stressful, even though experts consider the likelihood of anything malignant in young people with normal findings to be very low. I wonder how normal it is for lymph nodes to remain palpable for years and how to approach new lymph nodes when previous examinations were unremarkable.\nI hope to hear from people with similar experiences or insights and maybe get tips on how to better manage the intense worry about my health.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767909286.0, "id": "1q7pc8g", "author": "Karbonat_Erol_2021", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q7pc8g/should_i_still_visit_a_doctor/"}

Im an introvert and have been suffering from anxiety all my life. I came across this phobia I developed 3 years ago, and honestly i wanna get rid of it as soon as possible because as dramatic as it sounds, I feel like its taking away opportunities and happiness away from me.\n\ni developed a really bad phobia of extremely quiet environments and bodily noises. I'm sorry if this may come off as silly, i dont even know if I could assign a name to this phobia, but everytime I'm in an exam hall, I'm doing absolutely fine if the ac is on/ light ambience going on in the background. it's almost comforting to me. but as soon as the ac is switched off, the classroom goes dead drop silent, so silent u could possibly hear ur own heartbeat and the person next to u breathing. I start panicking internally like crazy even tho I may seem fine on the outside. yes I do ask the teacher to switch on the ac but some prick in the back feels cold 24/7 and most of the time the ac is busted and it's also winter at the moment. adrenaline rushes up and I feel my heartbeat increase, breathing gets harder and tears start to well up in my eyes. my brain and body instantly go into fight or flight mode for no reason at all, and as a response to adrenaline my stomach starts roaring like crazy; stomach rumbling noises and random bodily noises get triggered. their so loud and it gets me so embarrassed and scared that I need to flee from the situation. \n\nHad a test of 3 hours today and ran to the washroom and broke into tears and had a small panic attack. On the other hand, when the room is occupied with the noises of ac, chatter, or anything at all I feel completely alright and my stomach is no longer rumbling anymore.\n\nalways wondering of what the person sitting next to me thinks, \"ew wtf are those noises..?\" \nI dont know why such a problem even arose in the first place or what triggered it. it started off in school and now I suffer from it even outside school.\n\nI was always a good student but now my grades keep falling down because of a stupid phobia. I freeze midway my test and start to genuinely freak out. I always tend to avoid silence. I feel like I would genuinely pass out from it. In the beginning it was tolerable but now I just keep crying everyday and lose my appetite easily. I'm crying as I type this. I genuinely don't know what to do, I've told many people about this but no one takes me seriously. and its makes me mad that why am I the only one who's panicking this way and no one else? why are everybody else calm? do they not suffer from anything similar?\n\nI've told my parents about this but it was a long time ago. they're always there for me no matter what. I feel like a disappointment to them cuz my academic performance keeps falling down and they keep having hopes. \n\nand yes I've tried everything to get rid of stomach growls, eat more breakfast than I usually do, breathing exercises, self-reassurance that it's just you and ur paper and no one else cares. but nothing seems to work and my brain is being way too stubborn. at this point I would like for someone to knock me out in the head so I wake up not remembering some things and specially not this.\n\nfor ppl who suffer from this or something similar, what do u do? Im so tired that I wanna approach a therapist or a psychiatrist for pills because logical reasoning isnt working anymore.\n\nand please do not say things like just clutch ur stomach in or hold ur breath I'm sorry I've already done that and it makes my situation even worse. \n\nThank u all for reading.

It’s no exaggeration to say that over-the-counter cough syrup is more dangerous than anaesthesia.
