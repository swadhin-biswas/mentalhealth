I don’t know how to connect with people naturally, and when I do try, I often become cynical about the way people treat others or the things they say.

That cynicism makes me pull back even more, which just reinforces the isolation.\n\nI feel like I missed the stage of life where you’re supposed to learn how to socialize and date—when mistakes are expected and forgiven—and now I’m paying for it. Everyone else seems to already know the rules, while I feel like I’m trying to enter a world that moved on without me. Social skills and dating feel like muscles I never got the chance to build, and now they feel painfully underdeveloped. On top of that, the modern dating landscape feels especially discouraging. Dating apps make everything feel transactional and appearance-driven, like you’re being judged and discarded in seconds. It feels less about genuine connection and more about competing for attention, and I don’t feel like I measure up in that environment. I don’t think I’m attractive enough to stand out, and the constant emphasis on looks, status, and confidence just makes me feel invisible. When I look around, it feels like everyone else is moving forward—dating, building relationships, starting families—while I’m stuck watching from the outside. I feel behind, out of sync, and like I don’t really belong in today’s world or its expectations. Overall, I just feel completely defeated.\n\n  \nSometime this month I will be going through with it, I already have the necessary preparations, I just need a good time where I feel its right.

I had said no several times. That I just wanted a friend, not sex. He got angry and kept pushing. He started attacking everything about me verbally first. At that time I had known him for 14 years. He threatened me after I told mutual friends that he raped me. \n\nThey stood by him and pretended like it didn’t happen. They didn’t care. As if it isn’t humiliating enough to summon courage to share such trauma. My late fiancés family still loves this rapist. But claim they care and love me. Bullshit. \n\n2020 &amp; 2022 - a man I was dating bruised my body over 50 times and forced me to do things I didn’t want to. I have photo evidence and texts admitting he hurt me. He pulled hair out of my head which never grew back. This happened in New York. I told him to stop numerous times and he continued. He bit, pinched, roughly squeezed and damaged my flesh. I could hardly move for a few weeks. I never saw bruises that large or big all over me. At that time I had known him for 20 years. I never spoke to him again after processing the assault fully. Trauma remains.\n\n2025 - a new man I had been seeing for a couple years would try coercion tactics. But he violated me when I said no three times. I moved away but he violated me anyway. This happened in Massachusetts. \n\nSupport groups and therapy have been no help. I was hospitalized the last time I was raped.\n\nI’ve been met with victim blaming, and misogyny from both male and female doctors and nurses. \n\nI’m honestly scared to leave bed now. These weren’t strangers. I am prude. I am afraid. All the time. No help has helped, as the infrastructure doesn’t protect the financially crippled woman. Being mixed doesn’t help. \n\nEvery job I’ve had since my teens I have either faced racism or sexual harassment, by customers, coworkers and bosses. I’ve had women try to run smear campaigns against me at jobs because (their words) they were jealous of me. \n\nI freeze as a trauma response. \n\nAll three men are free. One is married with a daughter. One is a rich bastard who lives on a compound. \n\nI didn’t include sexual assaults I suffered in the 00’s. I didn’t mention the very verbally abusive ex boyfriend since he didn’t physically hurt me. He had caused previous ex girlfriends to try to take their lives. After him I tried to take my life. When he found out he said he didn’t care about that “stupid bitch.” I was always kind to him and respectful, and I was never a bitch. \n\nI think I probably have no real option right? Because I’m poor, have cptsd, horrendous and debilitating OCD, panic disorder, intrusive thoughts and have been suicidal ever since 2016. It didn’t help my father died soon after, my brothers ghosted after they received nothing in his will (1. My father was broke when he died. 2. I didn’t care about money, I cared my dad was dead) several friends died too young and close together. \n\nNumerous therapists admitted they didn’t know how to help even when I did 90 percent of the work. One male therapist commented on my looks and would call me at 11 pm randomly from his cellphone. I reported him and no action was taken.\n\nThere’s nothing I can do right?

My mom used to yell at me over every tiny thing, I could do everything right and mess up on one thing and she would ground me or yell at me. There were to many moments in my life where my mother would yell at me to the point where I started cutting. She might’ve been the reason why my ocd got bad too idk. She’s a good mom sometimes, it’s not like she doesn’t take care of me i just always felt shitty. When I was 13 it got really bad because I was cutting everyday: at school, in the bathroom, a lot in my room, over the stupidest shit. The internet was my escape, i had friends online and i was liked. I learned everything off the internet so I had a strong moral compass and was pretty safe online. This is tmi but i started masturbating at like 7 and watching porn not too long after because I had gotten exposed to it early. Unrestricted internet access gave me access to crazy videos online and I’m not proud. In 2021 I had discovered wattpad and wanted to read the “material” on there for intentions of getting off to it. I feel like a shitty person because I remember one of those stories that seemed like a groomer story but I don’t know if I had gotten off to it or not I can’t really remember but I tried looking everywhere and I can’t find it. The main character was a girl so If I had it probably was because I imagined myself as her, i’ve never been groomed but I would desire more terrible things to happen to me all the time and Im sorry if this offends anyone i never want to hurt someone i’d rather be the harmed one. I really hate myself but what’s stupid is is that i haven’t thought about this for years now and it recently popped up because I have been having a fear that i’m secretly a bad person and my brains just lying to myself. I constantly have a thought of, “if i’m a bad person i deserve nothing in life and i really hate myself and wish i could go back in the past to prevent myself from ever seeing that.” I haven’t really eaten, i’ve only slept and have been drinking like a bottle of water a day. My body feels dead and any reassurance i get isn’t helping. Will I forever be like this? If i am a bad person then i want to die so I won’t hurt anybody in the future. I’m sorry if i sound disgusting or disrespectful to those who have gone through this, i just don’t have any hope anymore and im full of self hatred.

I don’t care if ur transphobic reading this I hurt my own feelings more than u could hurt mine. I’ll never look like a woman let alone think like one let alone act like one let alone be one. I’ll never afford any surgeries to demasculinize my already horribly irreversibly masculinized body ESPECIALLY my face is so disgusting and I genuinely see no reason to live.

It’s selfish I know to leave them struggling but I don’t even care anymore. I did before for the rest of my life when I was blissfully ignorant about what I want and needed to do at the time but my life is just over. I missed out on being myself and coming out and now I’ll never be comfortable on my own. Body because I thought I was sick and screwed in the head and that it would go away.

Is it selfish to only live through the freedom of childhood and die before life really gets hard?\nI guess I’ve lived a pretty good life but I am terrified of living through worse memories. Minus all the times I’ve tried to kill and hurt myself I’ve had a good life, relatively enjoyable high school experience (ignoring the academic pressure as well). I have friends, sometimes I don’t trust them, but I have friends and we have good times I hope. \nI’m in uni now but I have no real aspirations. \nI’m really only here so that my very Chinese family can tell their friends and other relatives that they have a normal kid going to uni and on track for success. My life has only really existed to make sure my parents are happy, and I have failed quite miserably so far. Me being in uni seems to tell them that I am fixed and normal again, though nothing has really changed since high school.\nI have a lot of problems within myself that I know I could solve and go out to live a good life, but I am really too tired to work for it. High school was the time where I could, since my parents would feel pressure from the student well-being staff to send me to therapy, but now there’s no one to vouch for me. I’m not about to vouch for myself in front of my parents, it will not end well and I will make them mad and upset. It just wouldn’t be worth the trouble of trying to recover for real, that’s just a whole other giant hurdle to get over. I am not worth that much. \nI know I’m young and ignorant but the more I live, the more responsibility I will inevitably have, the more problems will arise, the more people I will lose. I have not truly experienced adult life but everyone around me is miserable anyway. I’ve been miserable my whole life, what reason do I have to believe that it’s gonna be any different.\n\nI live because there is no surefire way to leave that isn’t messy or viable in my current living situation. Plus I worry about whatever potential consequences there are of a failed attempt. Especially from family. I’m really just obliged to live for them even if they don’t want me around either. \n\nBut again, I think I have lived enough life to leave peacefully if there was just a button. Not even necessarily a “wow life is too painful and I can’t bear it anymore” kind of crisis, I think I am just tired and have had enough life. Too many years of being miserable and really only more to come.

You can think that those are only dreams, you arent that much wrong but thats my worst fear, to be blamed for the things I didnt do. And Im constantly getting blamed, or I think I am. Because every move they do, every word they say is like a threath for me. I constantly track their behaviors so I can understand if they are mad at me or not. I feel like everyone is mad at me because of something I did. I dont know what the hell Im doing wrong but I cant talk with anyone.\n\nIm constantly having thoughts about hurting myself and thats not in my control. Like two months ago I almost tried to jump in front of a train, I had a little talk with the police. I dont want to talk about it to be honest. Just know that I wasnt aware of the situation I was in because my days feel like Im in a dream. Everything is just blurred and I dont know what Im doing physically. I fear of myself that I will jump in front of that train again every morning I go to school and every evening I return to my home. I struggle with shaving my body because Im afraid of what if I cant control myself and cut all of my body. I do self-harm and it hurts like hell. My mom saw my cuts like months ago. The one she saw wasnt really serious so I just said a cat scratched my arm. I dont know if she believed me, I wouldnt believe myself because it was so obvious that I wasnt telling the truth. But she didnt care I guess. She doesnt want to believe that Im mentally ill. She was yelling at me that I was a psycho and need get help (I was fucking 13 that time, how come I was be able to get help myself? This is a very old memory of mine but I still cant get over it) everytime I try to defend myself, I was silenced because a nice and normal girl should be quiet, they believe I think. \n\nNow that, every hour I need to be alert. Everytime everyting can happen. I dont know if there is a god, but I feel like if there is god hates me. Or created me in accident and now god tries to unalive me because I was an accident. I believe that some people arent made to live and enjoy. But god, created me with enthusiasm yet making me suffer. I always think about this, about everything. I jealous when someone dies.\n\nThis night, I want to commit. I was thinking about this for a long time. I cant stop thinking about this.

Well I guess she’s not really my girlfriend anymore, but I can’t bear to call her my ex. We were together for almost 2 years, or more like 1.75 to be exact. It came out of nowhere for me. I was happy but, she wasn’t enough to stay. I haven’t told a lot of people, I’m heavily in denial. I’ve been depressed, I think, for a long time now and riddled with anxiety, unrelated to her, and I don’t have a lot of people in my life. She was kind of all I had. She was my motivation to keep going for so long, and I know that’s not necessarily good. I don’t want to put that on her, but it helped till I eventually felt like I found my own purpose. I don’t think I ever really got there, though. All I could think about shortly after it happened is that I wanted to do this. I’ve not been as sad as I thought, rather more calm, ever since I decided to do this. It’s all I can think about and I don’t see my mind really changing. I want to wait for her but I don’t know if I can, and I can’t bear to see her with anyone else. It breaks my heart that I couldn’t make her happy enough, it’s unbearable. What I’m worried about, though, is that she won’t remember me fondly, or she’ll be mad at me or hate me. Especially recently, we’re still talking and she told me she feels like I’m acting like I’m the only one going through a difficult breakup and not her, cause she’s still in love with me too, we just had too many problems that made her unhappy. That broke my heart to hear, but I kind of understood what she meant. I didn’t mean to but, I might’ve said some stupid things that were inappropriate after a breakup and kept looking to her for advice because I didn’t feel like I had anyone to talk to. I’ve already made this hard enough on her, and I don’t wanna make it worse, like I’m punishing her or something. The thing is, though, I don’t blame her at all, I know it’s not her fault. I know this is selfish but, this just felt inevitable for me. I don’t want her to feel like it’s her fault, but I don’t know how to prevent that. I really don’t think I can stay just to avoid that, though. And I don’t think she’d want to get back together, she can do so much better. Someone who actually gets her, unfortunately I was not that. I don’t really know if I’m asking for advice or just needed to vent, but I’ll appreciate any response really.

No one really likes me, I am obnoxious and a lot to handle. \n\nGenuinely, I am just tired and ready to stop living. My country has been going to shit. I do not feel stable. I have no generational wealth to help propel me forward. I put myself through school and became a software developer but I don't feel like I'm cut out for it. 2 years in and I still struggle. \n\nPeople keep telling me to go to therapy, go on medication.

I have recently been on an anti depressant for the last month trying to save myself from this drowning and it's not working yet. \n\nI feel so alone. I feel so pathetic. I am snuggling up with my stuffed animal from childhood because somehow that's one of the closest ways for me to find comfort. \n\nI thought leaving my abusive home life would make it better. I thought going to school and getting a decent job would make it better. I thought I wasn't trying hard enough with friendships and went to therapy to work on myself. I hate who I am as a person. I hate the memories I have of my life. I hate how fat and ugly I am right now because I didn't take care of my body and let myself go. I hate the state of the world.

I was told there was nothing to love. I was a mistake. I am an affair child and my parents hatred for each other supercedes any love they might have for me. They blame my existence and each other for their failings. I am a reminder of their failings. \n\nI had 2 suicide attempts in 2016, back when my CPTSD was at its worse. I ran away from my mom's house and lived on my own for 2 years at that point. My mental health never got better. So I attempted suicide twice within this span of a month. The first time was admittingly more of a cry for help. The second time, I took a hundred sleeping pills and seized and was found frothing at the mouth. I was involuntarily held after that second time. I distinctly remember one of our group meetings where one of the patients said out of everyone there, I worry her the most. Most people who attempt suicide realize how precious life is and never do it again. And I've done it twice, and still actively think about it.

No one bought anything for anyone else. She promised me some cute 100% wool socks and then she bought them for herself. \n\nMy psychiatrist and my psychologist don't care about me. I'm still grieving my cat and they don't care. They only want me to (...almost literally) break my back for a job that pays me nothing because they think that's the solution to all my problems. \n\nThe man I love has never been so distant. The people I trusted shut the door right in my face. Even my abuser, who's always so eager to see me, who buys me my favourite wine and 'snow' so he can use me... I told him I was on the verge of kms last night and he told me I needed to tell him earlier if I wanted to see him. And this is one of the people who swear they love me. \n\nI have no reason to live. \n\nI wanted to ask to be committed to the psych ward but my psychiatrist was very clear that she'd get furious at me for wasting a huge chance because I'll lose my job, this is all that counts for her. And losing my job means being even more dependent on my parents who clearly hate me. I have no one. I managed to cut on alcohol for a bit, especially because of the repercussions on my looks, but... I have nothing else. I can't and I don't want to rely on food anymore. \n\nI just... I just wish I had someone to hug me and make me feel safe for once. The man I love. Once again, everything that we had before he fell into his depression. I am absolutely hopeless and so utterly alone.\n\nI did the mistake of posting this on another sub and it was deleted.

Ventish rambling CW: SEVERE SH, ADDICTION, ED, VIOLENT HARMING &amp; SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, TRAUMA, MORE", "text": "***First, I would like to apologize if it sounds repetitive or wrong grammatically. I have a language disorder and English is my third language.***\n\nIm still in high school but have been having a really hard time to even get by. Not enough to immediately get an emergency hospitalization, just bad enough to be relapsing every day in both drugs and self harm. I haven't done any of my work because I'm just so drained every day. Being diagnosed with both BPD and ASD, along with several other stigmatized and \"trending\" disorders &amp; disabilities, I'm scared to go into inpatient care for several reasons. I'm terrified they'll treat me differently or even worse than the other patients because of my diagnoses.\n\nI do not have much of a problem with not having my phone, but I do have sensory seeking behavior that causes me to self harm when I'm bored. I'm scared of the medical debt I'll be in afterwards. I recently had all my bills completely paid off from as old as 10-12 years ago. I really can't afford to have another 50+ bills from going in and out of hospitals for my mental health as well. I just want to get better honestly. I'm especially scared of the financial burden but I'm also scared of how I'm going to catch up with school and how my family will act with me afterwards. ***I really want to know about people's experiences, mainly in the Northeastern states (USA) so I can see if I would actually benefit from it.*** I have constant suicidal and self harming thoughts and I'm not even sure if I will or will not act on them. Some include jumping in front of cars or stabbing my leg with a knife. I cut nearly every day and have been diagnosed with significant blood loss and have blood transfusions every week to month to treat it. It makes me feel guilty that the blood is going to me instead of someone that is actively dying. I'm upset that I FEEL like I'm rotting on the inside yet no one else can feel or see my mental pain.\n\nI cannot fully trust that I could keep myself alive but I still feel most safe in my room and cannot trust being in the hospital for over 3 days because of my medical trauma. Even being asked suicide &amp; addiction risk questions end up triggering my fight or flight and I instinctively say no because of it. I'm not sure if I will actually cooperate in the hospital. Especially with my ED. I have binge eating disorder and atypical anorexia. I don't know if I feel ready for recovery or if I even want to. I have several severe SH scars on different my body from cutting as deep as muscle and I've heard of people with my severity being photographed nearly naked in the hospitals to make sure they can keep track of how many scars you have and the thought of it intimidates me because I hate being reminded of my trafficking trauma and I want to avoid it at all costs. I'm scared to not have my headphones with me and I'm scared of how loud the other patients might be.\n\nI know I need help. I was classified as treatment resistant type for many of my MH disorders so I'm unsure if they'd even take me. I don't know, I'm just so lost because of how different everyone's inpatient and residential experiences are. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel so unlucky and guilty. I hate that I got this bad and I hate more that I feel comfort in it. I wish I wasn't poor. I wish I wasn't disabled. I wish I didn't experience so much. I especially wish I was able to feel the care and love people give me.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768062866.0, "id": "1q98l4b", "author": "No-Researcher6053", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1q98l4b/just_scared_at_this_point_ventish_rambling_cw/"}

I know my problem isn't as hard as what others experience based on what ive read on this page,, but I just want to vent my feelings... A bit of background about myself: I’ve always been a good student at school, always on the honor roll, top-of-the-class stuff. Maybe because of this, the pressure to do better started to affect me. Lately, I’ve been feeling so down and exhausted.\n\nI’ve got work piled up (club proposals I need to do, homework I don’t want to do, and quizzes I have to study for), and I try to motivate myself to push through, but I just feel so tired. Life hasn’t been easy on us after all. My dad just lost his job and reapplied for a new one, but his salary is lower than it used to be, so my mom is also working to make ends meet.\n\nI feel so guilty that I’m not doing my best in school while my parents are doing their best to provide for me and my sister. I want to do better. i want to work hard so that in the future I can return back all their sacrifices.. I want to live a happy life where I won’t have to think about money or school, or whether I’ll be successful in the future or not. But I just feel so tired of everything, i dont want to move from my bed.. I hate everything. \n\nRecently at school, my teacher (notorious for her strictness) didn’t accept our research paper, just because we failed to print the three copies she required. We didn’t find this out until we submitted the paper, and by then it was already too late. Our school closes at 5 p.m., and we passed it at around 4 p.m.\n\nHer rule was simple: no research paper, no defense. Because of that, we won’t be able to present next week and will get a zero. Haha. If only I had done better and actually worked properly, we would’ve been able to submit the research. But my useless self... goddammit. \n\nNow she released the list of groups allowed to defend next week, and of course, our names weren’t there. Seeing it written down made everything feel more real... A zero. Just like that.\n\nI tried to laugh it off at first, pretending it didn’t matter, but it did. It really did. All I could think about was how one small mistake turned into something this big. I kept replaying everything in my head... what I should’ve done, what I could’ve fixed, how different things would be if I had just tried harder.\n\nEveryone keeps saying it’s “just one subject” or “just one requirement,” but it doesn’t feel that way. It feels like proof that I messed up, that I failed when I was supposed to do better. And the worst part is knowing that this could’ve been avoided… if I wasn’t so tired, so unmotivated, so done with everything. I just want to end it all... but im still so damn young and i have a life to live... and I keep thinking of the costs my family would have to spend just to bury my stupid body...

Yesterday, a friend of mine dropped a bombshell about our other friend and how he had made unwanted advances towards another female friend of his that went to the same school as him. Apparently he had made her extremely uncomfortable in multiple situations and it seemed like he just kept pushing even though she’s told him that they are just friends. What he did was nothing deplorable like physical advances but one scenario was when he planned to surprise her with a big bouquet of flowers that she actively told him to not do and so did the rest of his friends who tried to bring him back to Earth and stop what he’s doing. Afterwards, the girl pretended to be sick because she didn’t want to see him that day at all, then he offered to just drop the flowers at her home instead which basically signaled a big red flag to the girl and their friends. It is not the first time that he’s been called out in a situation where he’s made someone that he was interested in uncomfortable. But we, as his friends tended to give him the benefit of the doubt throughout the years because hey, we were teenagers. And when those conversations were had, he had seemed genuinely apologetic and wanted to change but it’s been multiple times now that it has happened. So back to now, all of our shared friends have basically cut him off, they are all ignoring his messages and refusing to speak to him. But I couldn’t. Not when I knew that this person was having suicidal thoughts. I never want to feel the guilt of reaching out to someone just a tad bit too late, I wanted to at least show him that living is worth it. But now, I’m at a crossroads.

I’m not too sure it would help 100% but writing on paper helps me figure things out better. Just know you aren’t alone and life is always going to be full of challenges and difficulties, differences, everything. But you’ve made it this far, and you have someone who loves you, pets too? You have reasons to stay, and to relax and enjoy your life, everything is temporary, but living is a journey and a struggle. but it’s amazing when you think about, how your here, living, breathing. Everything, and I understand how werid it sounds and just thinking about everything. Just know that, things are going to be Okay. In the end of everything, it’s going to be okay. You don’t have to stress or worry about death or rush to do it, things are gonna be alright. Don’t rush your life to end, enjoy it till the end.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "title": "The world is dark and I can't change this mindset", "text": "Today I am 27. 2025 was the best year of my life because it was the year I managed to move out of my parents' house. I live alone in a very nice, small apartment, and I work from home. Everything is \"perfect.\" I’m single and I still want to have a relationship; I’ve focused my time on making art, music, and drawing, because I discovered that’s what I really love and what I’m best at. When I lived with my parents, we fought a lot, but today, living alone, I feel at peace. I’m the type of man who lives in solitude, just like those \"Red Pill\" channels on YouTube say every \"man of value\" should be. So, everything is fine, everything is cool... but there’s a problem.\n​I can’t bring myself to think that my life is good. There’s always something wrong that isn’t right. I’ve started having suicidal thoughts again, thinking that maybe my purpose on Earth has already been fulfilled. Some might think, \"you could get married, have kids, and build a family,\" but the damn thing is I can’t even do that. I’ve had three failed relationships that I count; I’ve slept with a good number of women, including escorts, but I feel like I’ve developed some kind of trauma regarding women. I can’t talk to them anymore. There were some who seemed to be hitting on me, but out of nowhere, I would block them and disappear. All the bad things that happened to me in past relationships would flash through my mind, so I’d do that.\n​Then, I came across content on the internet even worse than the Red Pill: the damn \"Black Pill.\" This sht feels so real that it’s like the thoughts I’ve had about the world since I was a kid, but I never had the courage to say them. I’m so deep in this sht that I can’t see the world any other way. I had just started believing in God and understanding the story of Jesus Christ's sacrifice—how everyone can have redemption in life if they recognize their past mistakes—but now it feels like there’s no turning back. Human beings are disgusting, greedy, and selfish, and none of that will change. So many bad things happening lately, news only talking about scandals and war... I can’t take it anymore.\n​Not to mention that Black Pill and Red Pill talk a lot about women and relationships. I think in part the Black Pill is right about the fact that a man born with good genetics will always reproduce and women will always prefer him. Because of this, I realized I’m very ugly. I truly deserve to die; I was born to die, like all the men who die in wars without ever having a family or passing on their DNA. I think I’m getting screwed over by thinking like this, I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m writing a comic book, which was a childhood dream of mine, but not to gain anything from it—just to make my inner child happy. So, after I finish that, I was already thinking about \"checking out\" with a bullet to the head. That’s all I’ve been thinking about lately.\n​Say whatever you want, you can humiliate me or whatever.

The things that happen to you do not define you. \n\nSome of us enter sexually violent relationships because we are trained to believe this is what we deserve, and because, weirdly enough we want to stop self harm and thus letting the partner being the wielder of punishment. (Which often happens sexually). That doesnt make us sluts.\n\nSome of us are, due to trauma, wired to only feel arousal by entering these types of situations, and even some of us end up not wanting physical contact as all. Or not even able to have sex any longer. (Which does not make us broken).\n\nIt is understandable to feel sick/infected. But this is not your fault. You are not the problem. Sometimes cruel coincidences. I have a personal theory that the body dissociate away the parts of self that would alert someone from danger and muting senses of fear among those who are victims of certain abuse. This to survive.

I don’t think I ever deserved one. I’m wrong. I’m fucking wrong, and I knew it. I held the grief so close to me because I knew I was in the wrong. I knew I was an asshole. I was responsible for so much pain. So much suffering came from my hands. I told myself I had changed but I didn’t. I just hid behind the guilt, using it as a security blanket for the truth.\n\n\tI deserve every single fucked up thing that happened to me. L was right to give me a concussion. I wish she would wipe my memory while she was at it. Maybe then it would hurt less, but that’s not what they deserve. Not what Mindy deserves. Not what all of Hillside fucking deserves. I don’t deserve to write this goddamn book. I told myself the book taught me that villains aren’t evil; they are just broken souls. And I was wrong. I was wrong, and I was lying to myself to think I was anything but. I am a waste of a fucking life. I wrote away my problems so I wouldn’t acknowledge what I had done, but I’m so sick and fucking tired of keeping this up. \n\n\tMindy, I’m sorry. I made you cry, I gaslit you about it. I took in your secrets and told myself it made me better because I didn’t dare say anything to anyone else. No. I was a fucking asshole. I was a horrible person, and I didn’t deserve your kindness. You were so kind to me. Kind enough that you wrote me a letter, and inspired me to be a better person. I failed miserably. My characters preach kindness. They preach forgiveness. They preach rehabilitation. And the mass murderers that I’ve written have more empathy and care than someone who claims to want to work in this field when I grow up. I don’t deserve to put these books into the world. I don’t deserve any of this. If I get a literary agent, they deserve to work with someone better than me. I don’t deserve happiness, and I sure as hell don’t deserve success. You deserved everything good in this shithole of a life. I wanted to give you everything. I ended up giving you nothing, and when I get down to Hell someday, I hope whoever the fuck actually runs the place doesn’t give me a single drop of mercy. I joke a lot about how one day I’ll die and I’ll get to meet Charlie Morningstar and she’ll check me into the hotel, but I don’t even deserve that. I can’t be fixed. I can’t be “redeemed”. IM NOT FUCKING SAVABLE, AND IT TOOK LOSING THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT THE MOST TO REALIZE IT. \n\n\tFelicia, you gave me a chance I didn’t deserve. You sat down with me. You told me what was expected of me. I nodded and didn’t listen. I deserve every drop of pain those decisions came with, and if it was the last thing I did in this world, I would make things right. I would swallow my pride, and I would let myself accept the help that i really fucking needed. I didn’t deserve Hillside. I deserve to get sent out of state. To get sent to a level fourteen or fucking wilderness therapy. I deserve to get the evil abused out of me. Force it out and away, and if that meant losing my shitty life with it, so be it. If it meant that my death would mean I paid for all the torment I gave to you, and all the lies I told, and all the fake promises that I failed to keep, I wouldn’t bat an eye as my life left my body. My characters deal in blood. They say that blood is the currency of life. They say that as long as you have the capacity to feel your own bodily fluid, you have the capacity to use that feeling to better yourself. So slit my throat open if it proves a point. Let my blood spill out and use me as a cautionary tale. Tell them that I’m the example of someone who let her emotions speak before the words could. And when everything is over and blood has spilled, and any sign of who I desperately wanted to be is gone, I hope you forget me. Not just you. All of Hillside. Mindy, Caitlin, Taylor, every single staff that opened their doors to me and I abused your kindness.\n\n\tI’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m so, so, so fucking sorry. I’d give the world for you, and in a moment of hate, I let myself push the closest thing I had to a family away from me.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "text": "Hey OP, I see your regret and pain that you are experiencing, but suicide is not “taking accountability” — it is running from it. And it is not a bad thing to run; I have run from accountability, too. I spent a whole year locked in my room by myself because I didn’t want to face the world after regretting the person I had been my entire life before the fallout. I’m still transitioning out of that phase and every day is a struggle.\n\nAccountability is incredibly hard and painful and scary. And the people you’ve hurt may never give you the opportunity to be accountable with them again. The only person you need to be accountable to now is yourself, and to do that, all you need to do is be kinder. It is almost insultingly simple that all of the evils in the world can be defeated by empathy, but it is true that if our culture was more empathetic, there would be less harm. You must embody that truth, as simple and difficult as it is.\n\nYou have made a first step towards being a more empathetic person: you are understanding how your actions affected people who you care about. Now you must take the second step: you must empathize with yourself. You are just a person, lost, scared, and confused like the rest of us. You are not an irredeemable comic book villain. People chose to leave you, which they had the freedom to do, and it sucks. Being abandoned is hell. But you are not lesser now than you were then; you have accumulated experiences and become a kinder person. Sometimes, losing people is a necessary part of growing.\n\nThe harm you’ve done is permanent; it is in the past. Nothing you do now will change it at all, including suicide. So you pick up the pieces and build something better not because it will make up for what you have done but because it will make you happier. You deserve to be happier. And happiness is on the other side of self-forgiveness. It is okay to forgive yourself even if it will take time. You deserve to forgive yourself. And hold the lessons you learned from these experiences close to your heart so that you do not repeat the harms you have done again.\n\nI believe in you OP and I hope you stick around to try anew.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768039896.0, "id": "nyrie6q", "author": "DoWhalesDreamOfKrill"}

Any critics welcome", "text": "Note:\n\nI first experienced being depressed when i was in 2nd/3rd grade after being bullied every day and treated unfairly by others. This was made worse by the fact that every person (even teachers) i told never actually got my parents or admin involved. So grown adults knew i wanted to end myself and didn’t say anything. Sometimes i wonder if somebody noticed early on, if i wouldn’t be like this; sad and depressed and angry, all the time.\n\n\n\nIts funny because i don’t know why i stopped feeling like i wanted to die (the first time around), i think it might have been overnight, but i don’t know. My brain was so depressed it stopped creating memories, so most my life is just a black screen with static.\n\n\n\nI was in 5th grade the next time i felt this way. This time it was less passive and more “i would jump off a bridge”. This was caused by friends turning on me and having a horrible teacher who made my OCD worse. He described gory scenes to us in immense detail, talk down on us, and overall was just a bad person. Nobody listened to me (us?) because he was in military. Even my own parents kept saying “it’s only a semester” “it’s only a few months” “it’s only a week”. It always sucked knowing your own parents don’t give a fuck about you.\n\n\n\nAfter a while, it got better- some way in between summer and winter of 6th grade.\n\nThen 8th grade came around (summer going into kinda too) and it hit me like a bus. I not only didn’t want to live anymore but i wanted to harm myself. I had been having these gruesome and darks thoughts for a long while now and it made me feel terrible. One time i almost cut myself scissors due to these thoughts. I also started forgetting things again and began seeing the nurse, Ms. Oday, very regularly. She understood me. She never pitied me or made me feel like shit. She was the rock of my life and kept me here.\n\n\n\nThen i was pulled out of school due to a medical condition that still has not eased. I rarely did my work and the people i lived with didn’t help that. They would play loud shows/music and try and start up conversations or make me hurry my work. Good thing i don’t remember most of this due to my mental state.\n\n\n\nNow we are in freshman year, a year where i learn that nobody actually cares about me in the grand scheme of things. If i were to die today i would be forgotten in a heartbeat. This was proved right on our xmas party where i was literally ignored the entire time. Then when i distanced myself, still nobody noticed. I wonder if somebody reached out to me if things would be different.\n\n\n\nEnough about me, let’s talk about my cats.\n\nKashmiere was our cat of 18 years who died of old age. For the first 6 months after her death, i cried every single day. i was wracked with guilt of the fact that i ignored her in favor of the new cat. i cried for the baby whom i love. i cried for the cat who was lost far too early.\n\n\n\nAround 3 years later i got Strawberry, my beautiful cat. She’s 10 and such a sweet baby, she’s so tiny and cute. Ever since i got her i have mourned a time when i know i wont have her. Sometimes i wonder if killing myself would be like betraying her.

You have shown and proven just how good of a father you are and i will miss you.\n\n\n\ni have never had a true friend before and it sucks knowing nobody actually likes me for me. it always just lola, or even just another one of my “friends” that they met me through. or they are just my friend for academic gain and happen to chat with me sometimes.\n\n\n\nI’m sorry, i just can’t fucking do it anymore. My whole life has been a cycle of depression and sadness that i can’t shake. I’m sick of being in mental and physical pain all the time. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Nothing has ever or will ever help me. This isn’t a temporary problem if it’s something that has affected me for all 15 years of my life. Goodbye.\n\n\n\nPeople i want at my funeral (specifically):\n\nI want it to be anyone welcome, i want to be mourned as a loss due to the system. A system that killed me.\n\n(Insert list of people i already have down but dont want on here in case someone catches on)\n\n\n\nI want it closed casket and i don’t want them touching me a bunch.

Bury me with my stuffed animals, especially mousy, octy, vanilla, and wormy. \n\nI want a cool gravestone with something cool written on it like “coolest person ever” or smth.\n\nPlay a good song, like a laufey song.

Or is it just an easy way to make people feel better about themselves. Warning, this post really is just one massive disorganized vent, so I apologize in advance..\n\nI've struggled a lot emotionally, physically, and mentally throughout the years. I can't say childhood because truthfully, i'm still in it. I haven't even turned 15 and yet I've learn to hate repeating the same cycles over and over again. At the end of every week, I feel drained of my social battery as I mask my way through life— (For context, I have severe anxiety, OCD, and in im the midst of getting diagnosed for potential ASPD or BPD.) It's extremely difficult feigning empathy and emotions, even when it's to people I genuinely consider friends. I've never felt intense emotions like rage,deep romantic love, or even a strong care for most of my family, let alone myself. And although I can understand why people feel the they way they do, i've never once been able to make myself feel particulary empathetic about their emotions. And lastly, I feel like there's no one to talk to because if I expressed everything i've done and how I think, i'd be deeply shamed for it.\n\n My mental stability is practically non-existent. I've never claimed depression— one of the mental illnesses that I never really thought I had. But my flippant mode is quite like it. Even over the smallest things like something not going as I planned or a failure to exceed my expectations leaves me experiencing intense depersonalization as makes me want to take my own life. And maybe it'd be better if I got what I truly wanted: validation and attention. I won't go into detail about how horrible of a person I am, because I don't feel much guilt about it. When I really think about it, I take no responsibility for my actions and instead blame it all on my trauma. I don't need shame to understand the gravity of my actions. But it really makes me wonder if people genuinely care about everyone. Every stranger going through a hard time, regardless of their past.

I get that, by what you’re talking about by saying everyone wants to feel better about themselves and so on, but yes. There are people who do genuinely care, and who don’t want to benefit from helping someone, they just want to help. You aren’t alone, there are people who are around who want to see you get better, and even yourself, you should want to get better for yourself. You are the person who is always going to be there for you, yes there are people are to support you, but you’ve got to be there for yourself to. Everyone has their own experiences, everyone is different. Which makes life have purpose, because you get to try new things, learn new things. Life as a concept, and thinking about it like it’s a consequence makes you feel worse. Live your life the way you want, take it easy on yourself too. You have so much life to live, and so much to try and have fun doing. Going out, hanging out, meeting new people, doing things for yourself, taking care of yourself. \n\nIf everyone on the planet, didn’t go out \nand didn’t talk to anyone, we’d all just be deprived and miserable. \n\nYeah there are so many shitty people, weird people, horrible people. Who do horrible things, and like to do those things. The good thing is not everyone is like that. Everyone is different, and everyone has their own ways of expressing, thinking, seeing life through their own eyes. \n\nYou give life purpose, everyone does. \nLife doesn’t have a purpose, unless you choose to give it one, and give yourself and your life meaning. Staying in bed, bed rotting, hating yourself, will make you miserable. \n\nBut every day you do something small, or try a new thing, make small changes, look into new things, you experiencing. \n\nIn life your going to experience things, and that’s what helps me get through the whole, “nothing matters, people are using coping mechanisms that have been around for years” to date, have a baby, to do all of these things, but people do these things to try new things, and experience \n\nJust in my advice, if these few paragraphs just seem a bit of me rambling and mumbling. Reach out to someone, talk to someone.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "title": "Please help.", "text": "17yo, need your help.\n\nI am 17 years old and I am really afraid of growing up. I’ve been preparing for an exam for the past two years, and I’m not confident I’ll perform well. I’m fairly certain I won’t score very high, but that’s not my main issue anymore. I’ve come to terms with that. I’ll still be going to a decent college.\nWhat’s bothering me now is what my life looks like after this.\nAs a child, I always wanted to travel. At the same time, I had big ambitions and wanted to make something of myself. From what I’ve seen, though, being truly successful requires complete dedication, and it feels like you don’t get time to enjoy life at all. That clashes heavily with my desire to travel and experience the world.\nOn top of that, I’m not even sure which field I want to pursue. I’m currently studying computer science, but for me it was always meant to be a degree—a starting point—not necessarily a lifelong career. I don’t know if I want to work in technology, or in film (which has been a personal interest for a long time), or in something else entirely. I genuinely don’t know what I want to do with my life.\nThe biggest fear of all is the thought that I might go through life and never achieve the things I dream of. That fear has made me feel really suicidal over the past three to four weeks. Every day feels heavier. The world looks duller. I’m not even an adult yet, and I’m already terrified of time passing and of never really living.\nI don’t have anything against a normal life—marriage, kids, a stable career. I’m open to all of that. But I’m talking about life as a whole. I’m scared of waking up one day and realizing that I never truly lived, that I never explored what I could have been.\nThere are so many things I want to do. So many books I want to read, so many movies I want to watch, so many experiences I want to have. I constantly feel like I’m running out of time, even though I know it sounds ridiculous for someone my age. People tell me it’s stupid, but it doesn’t feel that way from inside my head.\nSome days I don’t feel like doing anything at all. Other days, I feel overwhelmed by choices—should I travel, work a normal job, start a business, go all-in on a hobby, or try something completely different? It feels like whatever I choose will define my entire life, and that thought is terrifying.\nI’m ambitious, and I’m willing to work hard. My fear isn’t effort—it’s failure. What if I give everything and it still doesn’t work out? What if my ambitions fade, or worse, stay alive but unfulfilled?\nI don’t know how to put all of this into perfect words. I just hope someone understands what I’m going through and can guide me on how to approach life with the right mentality. I wanted advice from people who’ve actually lived—people who had big ambitions, whether they achieved them or not.\nI don’t want to stop dreaming. I just don’t know how to live with these dreams without feeling crushed by them.\n\nEdit- I realize the \"only big ambitions people part makes me sound like a dick. I actually meant anybody who had like an idea of what they want their life to look like, and had to give up something to pursue another, or something like that.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768015474.0, "id": "1q8t94l", "author": "Miserable-Inside-417", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1q8t94l/please_help/"}

I don't have dreams (both aspirations and for some reason sleep dreams lol) and no matter how hard I try to come up with anything that would make me feel like life is worth it, I can't. I'm a 2nd semester freshman at a big ACC school with no clue what I want to do, and I'm only here in the first place because this is what offered me the most financial aid. I'm taking the most fuckass assortment of gen eds and stuff to see if something interests me, but whenever something piques my interest it is not the typical choice of my peers, it always seems to be something negatively lucrative and like it probably won't be worth the investment. I hate having zero direction and my motivation has always been tied to end goals, not to the journey, and not having that has entirely fucked with me. I can't find purpose in anything now and I don't want to keep living like that.\n\nI was the top of my class in high school, a handful of spots away from valedictorian, active in clubs, kinda teacher's pet-ish, hard-working, incredibly disciplined, but I never really had friends. The only thing that has remained of those so far in college is the no friends part lol. my mom and my grandma are literally my best friends, I love them more than anything in the world and that's one of the hardest parts of this growing up grief, I fucking don't want to leave them (and truth be told, I've gone home almost every weekend, so I really haven't left them, but I'm already in shambles seeing them less than I used to). my grades first semester were horrible and I swear I tried so hard, I just don't get it. I'm too scared to socialize and I don't know if I even want to, especially because I am almost the total opposite of the other 85% of the people at this school, so I haven't joined any clubs or anything. I guess I could transfer, but I never had a dream school or anything so I don't know where id go or what id do. There's also nothing not college related I could see myself doing. Might be worth saying I am a first gen college student which makes it all the more confusing, I don't know what to expect or how to deal with anything at all.\n\nI miss high school, even though I didn't love the people, I loved knowing exactly what to do and when, it was so predictable and safe. I knew what I was doing M-F from 8-4, and that I always had my weekends for me. I feel like if I wanted to keep living the only life I envision is one where I'm fast-forwarded to a point where everything is concrete and decided, at least enough. I don't think I can get myself there. I think i've always kinda felt this doom, at least 7 or 8 years of it, but college has made it all catch up and fall into my mind at once. I would rather die than keep doing this.\n\nLike I said, not actively planning anything, but I have done sh before and I'm scared thats gonna come back again even though it feels so fucking juvenile to me. I definitely don't look when I cross the street and I pray that every pain I have is some terminal disease, or that my driving too fast will finally bite me in the ass or ill accidentally mix some otc stuff that isn't supposed to mix. Like I drove home today, to the place that I think will make me happy, but all I could think about was what speeds I could hit going around curves and what could possibly happen. Or that some weird apocalyptic shit like the walking dead or the leftovers will just come and let me die like the circumstances in those situations demand.\n\nI feel bad for exploding like this, and I do have a therapist, but I am so scared to be fully honest with her even though I like and trust her so much.

I have always dealt with depression and anxiety since childhood But since having my son it has ramped up. \n\nI have quit 3 jobs in the past year just because. \n\nMy husband does uber. He works 12 hour days doing it. I work as a preschool teacher. We don’t make much money. Majority of the bills are on me. \n\nIm tired of struggling and my husband refuses to do anything but door dash. When my son goes to bed at night I have started drinking just so I can feel some happiness on the day. I am concerned because it has become a nightly habit of drinking to the point of being drunk.

I deal with 20 4 year olds all day in the class and then I come home to taking care of a toddler and my husband is barely home. \n\nI leave the house at 6:30am and do not come home until 6:30pm. Mainly because my husband refuses to pick me up from work so I have to take public transportation. Thankfully my mom watches my son but that means when I get off work I have to take a train and bus to pick him up and then a bus home. \n\nOn top of that I am in college online. However I have been failing my last couple of exams. I am in college to get a bachelor’s so I can get a pay boost so we aren’t living paycheck to paycheck to pay check\n\nI failed another exam today. I feel like ending this suffering. If I weren’t a chicken I would have done it years ago. But now because I have a son , I don’t want to leave him motherless. My husband doesn’t even know what size diaper he wears so if I off myself, who is going to take care of my son?\n\nI told my husband if it weren’t for our son, I would have ended it today. His response is that I am being ungrateful to God and that I just need to deal with life and suck it up. \n\nI constantly fantasize about suicide but I know im too chicken and I can’t leave my son motherless.

If your husband is going to be an asshat like mine was (told me he forbid me to go to a doctor because they would tell me to leave him/he didn’t believe in such things anyway) then you do not need to discuss it with him.

Still feeling fucked in my soul honestly. I've solved so many problems but I can't seem to escape depression, can't seem to escape my guilt. Constantly seem to feel like I'm nothing but a burden to friends and family. Every time I slip back to shit that I did in the hole I just feel like I'm getting more and more fucked.

People actually make me feel better. Monika, the Floridians, Parker, my family, even randos and coworker's. I may be broken but the people around me make me feel more stable and happy then I may actually be. I guess the shitty feelings come from the fact I feel like I balance on the edge from positive and negative. I also still feel like I'm not worthy of anything positive that shows up in my life. I've been a monster for years. Am I truly worthy of anything good that happens to me? Truly? I know those monstrous feeling stem from things and abuse prior but I still feel evil for the thoughts that came after. I'll know what I mean. I just feel anxious and guilty in general. I truly haven't done anything worthy of my existence. I only feel worthy when I'm a bank account for those who helped me through the years.

I love the people around me, it really is the reason I can keep even breathing. If my existence can keep others going/any amount of positive feelings then I have to keep going. Nothing else to it. I wonder how many times I wrote posts when drunk or inebriated? It feels like maybe half these posts on Fuckery may have been because I was drinking. I wonder if this is the only way I can feel in touch with my emotions? It certainly feels like it half the time. How often would I go on the suicide watch subreddit and try to help folks try to exist? It was only while drunk and I certainly feel the urge now. I'm broken but strangely more free then I've ever been. Time heals wounds and that certainly seems to be the case. I love the idea of people and cultures. I think people are worthy of life, just not me. Which is so much better then I used to be. So maybe I'm truly healing. Hard to say.

SHE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT ME AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM THE CELL, SHE GOT ME SMALL AMOUNTS OF CHERRIES SO I CAN EAT.. \n\nwhile everybody had their first touchscreen phones, i had some old ass nokia because again- i didn’t want my mom to feel extra bad about me not having the same stuff with my peers. i was really sucking it up successfully with pride that i would be always okay.\n\nmy college prep exam course was so expensive that my grandma took out a loan for me just to be able to study and go to college - i didn’t failed her, they’ve given me A LOT that i WOULDN’T fail them.\n\nmy college apartment was also paid by my grandma and she took another loan just to pay out for the entire year so i won’t be embarrassed in front of my roommate for not being able to pay a penny rent every month.\n\nmy dad wasn’t there for us, he re-married.

Some people recharge by being outside and constantly moving, and some people feel safer and calmer at home. Some guys are social, some are quiet, some are creative, some are steady, and none of that makes anyone less of a man. What hurts is the pressure — the idea that you have to perform a certain version of masculinity just to be accepted. That pressure wears people down.

I don't want to continue living as someone who has been tainted, but nothing makes sense anymore. The sunset is indeed beautiful, there is so much beauty and curiosity about our beautiful planet Earth. But they are no longer mine to admire. The study, the admiration, the love, and the beauty. All these things are no longer mine to hold and appreciate. The sunset and the beautiful summer day are like the concept of a cake, something that will soon be devoured by someone else. All concepts, words that I can no longer touch or imagine. It is no longer my right to live and appreciate life. My home is my bed and my thoughts; I see no reason to improve after doing something considered one of the worst things you can do to someone you say you love.  I will miss my potential, my games, my books, my loving parents, my lovely home, my sweet little dog, my friends who wanted me to improve but grew tired of helping me, and of course, my victim: my ex, who kindly offered me forgiveness. He asks daily if I'm okay and even tried to stay in my life. Unfortunately, now I won't remain in anyone's life. Forgiveness was given from the one I hurt, and I am grateful. Perhaps it's important to know that I wasn't exactly a person with a clear head before. Since I was a child, I thought about suicide, but most of the time I was trying to survive and live. I was in therapy trying to get better, and I relapsed, making one of the worst mistakes a human being can make: betraying someone who wants what's best for them. I think that was the push I needed. I would do anything to go back in time and have fidelity and loyalty as one of the most valuable virtues to prevent all of that from happening, but unfortunately I was immoral, cowardly, and selfish in the worst way. I see genuinely repentant unfaithful people trying to rebuild the lives they themselves ruined; they are trying to live and find meaning unlike me, even those who committed acts of greater disrespect than I did. However, I don't want to be a person who was ever capable of doing any sort of betrayal to someone I was supposed to protect. I will die a virgin, never having kissed, never having felt the human warmth of my lover, because our relationship has always been long-distance. I wish him to feel the sweet embrace and affection of a kind and virtuous woman, unlike me. A selfish bitch who will soon \"catch the bus.\" I'm considering overdosing on my antidepressants I've started taking. I imagine I have 5 packs left, so I'll take all 5 at once and ingest hand sanitizer to see if it increases my chances of dying already.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "title": "Am I doing the right thing?", "text": "\nThis isn’t my suicide experience but someone else’s and here’s their story:\n\nIve been friends with a guy for a few years now and we’re pretty close. On the surface he looks and acts like your typical guy with an average life. But he’s anything but that since when he was a child he had a pretty rough childhood with an abusive household and he never really got to learn from other kids and so he never really had a childhood. From this I could have already guessed that it may have affected him emotionally but I never really got confirmation until roughly a year ago. For context during his childhood despite all the bad things around him he still tried his best to be a good person, he wasn’t a saint and did evil things from time to time but he genuinely tried to be a good person. However he also has bad luck and so it never really worked out for him and people just kept using him and he never really got what he wanted. From that I figured he might be slightly sociopathic I never confirmed it tho until he told his best friend (not me I’m a close friend not best friend), he took a risk since he’s held that secret for years and has never told anyone but unfortunately for him his best friend couldn’t understand. While this was taking place he was also suicidal for different reasons I’ll get to in a moment but in just 1 month everything collapsed all since he told his best friend about his suicidal ideation and wickedness. He lost his best friend more, than half his friends, his family bullies him since him being suicidal is bad for their reputation, his school expels him since even tho they have a suicide prevention act they saw him as a threat if he ever died and he got expelled and so on. The friends that stayed and left all knew he was suicidal it spread like wild fire and that he was gonna attempt and he did… he survived but a part of him did die the part that still held on to morality. His goal in life was simple just be happy and he knew he was gonna get that by finding a place to belongs he wasn’t gonna find that with family and so he was gonna do it with friends… he never felt like he belonged anywhere. He used to want and be such a good person then he became neutral and how he’s… evil, he’s acknowledged that no matter the trauma it isn’t an excuse for evil but we both know that because of trauma his capacity to care is lessened and so now he only really cares about the people he loved. You may be wondering how I know that for sure, I see it from his actions, words everything it’s always been his goal and caring about his friends is part of it. If someone isn’t a friend tho then he becomes very… cold he’s evil and takes pride in it, he used to be highly religious but he said he’s not anymore since no one is coming to save him and so now if he has to then he is more than willing to hurt a stranger to benefit him and the people he cares about. He’s even willing to let someone die from suicide if it means he’ll be happy and he knows it’s wrong, I do too but he just can’t care anymore, he’s okay with the fact that me and his other friends are good people heck he’s helped all his friends with whatever they do whether they’re good people and he helps them help the less fortunate or they’re bad people and he helps them bully the less fortunate.\n\nI don’t know if I’m doing the right thing it may seem like it but we both already acknowledged that he’s a monster he became what he never thought he never would be. To give him credit he’s handling it better than most since he’s gone through more things than some people have in their entire lives and the fact that he still has a small sense of morality means a lot. I feel as though I failed him as a friend since I could’ve been there for him but I wasn’t and now I don’t know what to do anymore. What do you do when someone who cares about you is also a monster? More than willing to sacrifice anyone he doesn’t care about for those that he does and himself? Innocent guilty doesn’t matter as long as they’re not a friend then he sees them as a tool. He doesn’t do it in front of me since he knows I’m a good person and doesn’t want me to feel terrible but still knowing he does it in secret hurts me since I let this happen", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767978837.0, "id": "1q8e41g", "author": "Scienceandswiftie", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1q8e41g/am_i_doing_the_right_thing/"}

As the title says, I (22F) am still struggling a lot of years after mom (39F) 's suicide.\n\nLong story short, mum died in 2017 and I'm still fucked up. The past year has been especially bad - I feel like ending myself approximately every 3 days, sometimes even more often.\n\nAfter she died, I became super close to other relatives, we talked about her, they helped me feel like myself again... And they're gone too. And I feel it's been a downwards spiral since then.\n\nWithout trying to boost my ego, I'm pretty successful in my field (primarly arts and NGO stuff). I've received several awards as well as worked with some pretty influential people in my country. Friends, as well as strangers, have called me an \"inspiration\", \"a role model\", \"super creative\", etc. I've had many people tell me they want to be like me, to be \"as brave\", \"as creative\", \"as ambitious\" etc as I am. \n\nYet here I am, wanting to off myself so fucking frequently. I smoke like a chimney, binge eat every day and can sometimes get myself blackout drunk just to feel better for a short while. I know I'd pretty easily get addicted to other substances if I have the chance.\n\nI once joked with a super close friend that my ultimate goal In life is to outlive my mum. I don't think it'll happen. I feel like, not only time doesn't heal, but every year it just makes shit 10 times worse. \n\nI've heard all the stuff - volunteer, workout, talk with friends, do art, etc, etc, etc. I do all of that. It doesn't make anything better. I can't celebrate my achievements, I don't feel good enough like... ever. I mean, I wasn't good enough for my mum to stay. I have amazing friends, one of which has also been through a ton of shit and we often talk about it yet I try to control my abandonment issues and not show them how attached to them I am and how much I dread the time when we separate and I'm alone with myself and my thoughts again.\n\nAnd I know all the other stuff, I've heard it all as well by many well-meaning friends and relatives - it's not my fault, my mum has struggled with it for a long time, including, by more religious relatives, that \"God gives his toughest challenges to his strongest warriors\" or whatever the saying is. \n\nI've achieved a lot of my dreams. It feels great the first few days, week, etc and then I just crash and this emptiness returns. I've told myself all the inspirational stuff - to get up, to never give up, that life could end at any second and I should fight, achieve my dreams, etc... so what? At the end of the day, I'll just feel the same fucking way again. \n\nI've been doing all the productive stuff, as well as the self-destructive stuff. I feel the self-destructive stuff so far has been much more numbing but at the end of the day, I feel like the only thing that will help will be to find a time machine, tell my mum I know she's suicidal, do my best to help her, tell my grandma to quit smoking before she develops COPD, tell my uncle to quit drinking and smoking before he gets cancer, tell my other grandma to get tested as her cancer that has been in remission for 30+ years will come back, etc, etc. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant!

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "text": "Belive me, if you have intentions to kill yourself - there's definitely something wrong enough. It's just not the conventional and habitual reasons, and more hidden, unnoticeable ones, those that you didn’t even think about as reasons. Some people suffer of their experience more directly: through psychological trauma, chronic pain, mental disorders and memories. And some, like me and probably you suffer from from it on a more subtle level: you don't necessarily have to constantly suffer for such intentions. Sometimes it's about how your upbringing, your environment, the content you consumed, and even the slightest, unnoticeable influences are screwing you from within. It might be less about pain than about dissatisfaction with life, a lack of activity, a lack of will to live, a lack of enthusiasm, and most importantly, laziness, a hopeless laziness not just in matters, but in life itself. And this suffering is also a valid reason for such thoughts. Sometimes it's even worse, because in such cases, even the idea of ​​suicide doesn't help much; you don't get rid of some itch, you simply essentially become even less passionate about life, closer to full-blown decline. I know how it feels, at least i think I know. It feels like you want to take your own life for nothing, like there's something fundamentally wrong with you, so much so that even when you've supposedly been \"given everything,\" you've still somehow screwed it all up. But that's not true, for you, it's not true; even with a mountain of opportunity before you, countless open doors, you still feel hopeless. From the outside, and even from your own perspective, it looks like you're simply lazy, passive, but it feels like you're locked in an invisible box, like a mime", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768001209.0, "id": "nyovnng", "author": "simplisticlangur"}

I feel like I’m just watching my own life. I watched my only real friend in HS die in a crosswalk by a drunk driver on Halloween. I didn’t do anything then and didn’t do anything when I was raped and didn’t do anything when I was assaulted again in college. I hate being a girl and I hate feeling empty all the time.
