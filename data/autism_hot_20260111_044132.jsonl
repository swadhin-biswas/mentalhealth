{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "Suggestions for the mods - Rules", "text": "Official Meta Post  \n\nWe’ve been working on new rules for a few months now, since April. We’ve hit a stump so we’re asking for tips/feedback. \n\nHere’s some of the new rules we’ve been working on (we can only have 15). We’ve combined some that were essentially the same thing.  \n\n  - Be kind (This will include no hostility, personal attacks, bullying, bigotry and continuing online arguments, following people around threads/posts/subs and tagging/showing usernames of other users/mods/subs on reddit)  \n  - Follow the posting guidelines (This combines the old rules of check the wiki faqs, low effort/spam/clickbait/ragebait/duplicate, no self diagnosis debate (as that would now be a stale topic), no stale topics (a regularly updated page in the wiki listing topics temporarily or permanently banned because they’ve been done too much). \n  - Pseudoscience and Misinformation  \n  - No medical advice (This combines asking if you are autistic/someone else is autistic, posting online test results, giving medical advice).  \n  - Mature content rule (If it’s not appropriate for a 13 year old, it needs to be marked NSFW. Alcohol, drugs flagged as NSFW. Sex education is fine, but graphic sex posts, posts about libido, type of sex, etc, get redirected to our NSFW subs.).  \n  - Online safety (No personal information or pictures)  \n  - No advertising/fundraising.  \n  - No politics (includes petitions but excludes news). \n\nThere’s other topics we need your opinion on before we make a rule. These topics are:   \n  - AI usage, images and text, apps made from AI or with AI that people try to post here.   \n  - What is considered off topic? Would a recurring themed megathread be a good idea for the off topic posts? Do you have any other ideas to keep off topic at bay in the main feed?  \n  - How do you feel about people posting screenshots of their messages and asking what went wrong or what the person means? Is that on topic? \n  - Engagement is low on posts with no images. Memes already aren’t allowed but that doesn’t get enforced well because people don’t report it. What can we do to make this more clear?   \n  - What is included in advertising/marketing/fundraising? Someone who wants to make an app? Someone who is writing a book? Someone who already has a product made? Something that is free? Social media profiles like someone’s youtube? Someone who has an idea and wants options on it? Etc.  \n - What are some stale topics?  \n\nAny other things you think we are missing that should have rules?  \n\nHow would you word these rules to be clear and concise?  \n\nAnd lastly, when we do change the rules we will make a post. This post will be highlighted permanently at the top of the sub. Should we \n\n1. keep it short and link each rule to a page in the wiki that gives a more in depth description with multiple examples or  \n2. put everything in the post  \n\n***Please keep all meta discussion to this post, all others will be removed for off topic.***\n\nMeta means posts about the subreddit, its moderation, its users, or posts made in the subreddit instead of posts about the subreddit topic, which for us is autism.", "score": 58, "num_comments": 313, "created_utc": 1761322469.0, "id": "1of2036", "author": "press-app", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1of2036/suggestions_for_the_mods_rules/"}

One not based on someone's bias, and I might agree that a blanket ban is good. However, subreddits rules should NOT be created based on personal biases, and that's my big issue with a blanket ban. It's not the ban itself. It's the reason it was introduced, which is because people can't be civil and keep the arguments where they belong, i.e., r/AIWars .\n\nThe only reason politics discussions are banned is because people aren't mature enough to have a conversation without people turning toxic and causing arguments. The ironic thing is, it's the people preaching for a ban that are the ones who generally start such arguments. They need a ban because they can't control themselves and not start an argument because someone else mentioned gen AI in a sentence. \n\nThis is why, in another comment, I suggested adding a rule that there is no arguing about gen AI, keep the negative attitudes on the subs where it belongs, and there shouldn't be a problem. \n\nIt's not like it's something that's talked about extensively in this sub anyway, so how much would a blanket ban actually change?

According to her, he understands consent, and they both understood where the problem was, but it was keep repeating . OPP described the whole thing in a way like it wasn't a big deal to her, just something they both tried to do two or three times (one very specific thing during sex), wanted to make it work, and wouldn't mind or have a problem with not doing it ever again. Just came for genuine help with communication, which according to her bf was because sie wasn't direct (didn't directly told him to stop, or to change what they're doing, and no safewords etc.).\n\nNot only there was a bunch of \"autism is not an excuse to be bad™\" (which is a separate issue) comments, but there were also those who straight up started calling OOP's bf a rapist, and adviced (or in some cases demanded) that OOP calls cops on him.\n\nWas it possible that the whole thing more serious, that OOP's boyfriend lies and SA took place? Sure, I wasn't there so I can't tell that it wasn't like that, but the way OOP approached it told us that she was aware of what's going on in her life and had things in control, except for that one issue.\n\nSex is a serious topic and can be a very slippery slope, so I get why people are careful with what they comment. Thing is that if the whole topic wasn't about sex (or anything what would put autistic communities in a bad light), users wouldn't mind the idea that some of someone's autistic traits get in their way, and then try to give tips on how to either work with that, or work around it. Plenty of posts from caretakers, friends or family members asking for help get wholesome and useful replies.

It's too vague to align this with \"be kind\" imo.

They're off topic, so shouldn't they just... not be discussed here at all?\n\nCan automod be used for certain words or phrases, if it's not already? \n\nTo me, off topic is anything that is overly general or leads to low effort, repetitive discussion. E.g. posts about utensils, literally always the same comments \n\n&gt; How do you feel about people posting screenshots of their messages and asking what went wrong or what the person means? Is that on topic?\n\nI would personally say no. I also think these are used to seek validation, instead of genuine insight or clarity.\n\n&gt; Engagement is low on posts with no images. Memes already aren't allowed but that doesn't get enforced well because people don't report it. What can we do to make this more clear?\n\nWhen someone uploads an image, is it possible to show a note prompting the user to review the rules before posting? Or something like, \"Please note that we are not a meme sub! If you're uploading a meme, it will be removed. Try /r/aspiememes (or w/e sub) instead\n\n&gt; What is included in advertising?

I can try to find a way to rig it maybe. This would be part of an automation (enforces before someone posts or while they are drafting) which is different from automoderator (only acts after the content is submitted). The problem with automations is that it only works on certain forms of Reddit, anyone on old Reddit won’t see those.

We’ve had trouble figuring out if WIP are marketing/marketing research that shouldn’t be allowed. Some mods think it shouldn’t be allowed, some mods think it’s a good idea. It’s along the lines of “I’m think about making this, would you guys use it” or “help me write an autistic character for my book” or “give me feedback on my website”.

Honestly we're the perfect place to begin talking about real solutions. \n\nReddit is about as diverse and vibrant a community as it's possible to be. \nThere's a place for everyone here. \n\nUnfortunately sometimes that can be a bug and not a feature. \n\nNot because any pelarticular type or style of human is bad. \nThats never been the problem. \nSometimes people get confused, or seduced, or misled; and they act in ways that just aren't rational.\nI think its because of fear mostly. \n\nFear can feel like our most powerful emotion, it can overwhelm our ability to make sense of the world and what is truly making us afraid. In our terror we sometimes lash out, often at whoever's convenient.\n\nThat unfortunately; Is frequently groups like this one. Amazing places that provide a circular slot in a seemingly endless sea of squares. It's not because we're weak, or lesser, or deserving of their harm. \n\nIts just because they need find a face to fit the unseen spectors that they truly fear. I've seen what happens when that becomes; rather than the occasional, not even just the frequent. I've seen it become the norm.\n\nThis place built on a foundation of diversity, of hope for the future , and fun, and a shared journey to try to understand who we are; Turns into a cross section from the worst of nightmares. \n\nWe're not there yet, but the signs are their, if you know what to look for. \nI've been a user since 2012,  I'm not exaggerating. \nThere were times when I felt genuinely sick seeing the things people were able to say to another human being. \nI just really dont want that to happen again. \nThe real issue we're facing as community, right now; has nothing to do with machines. \n\nWe as a community are afraid, on both sides. \nWe are struggling to understand something no human before us even considered would be possible. Let alone be a genuine reality; but here we are. And in that fear we as often happens, lash out. This time is different though. Because this time we are not trying to harm who we think we are harming. We see a machine as the enemy, or the enemies of the machine as such.\n\nBut the machine is a mask, behind which is just, simply; you, and me, and her, and him, and them, and us. \n\nWe've let an illusion corrupt our senses. To show us a target made of circuits and wire. But in our need to attribute blame we have forgotten the human that lies behind it. \n\nWhich is rule 1 btw.  So, ya.

An autistic person could have two different levels, or even have one level be 1, 2, or 3, and the other fall below 1. I don't know where something has gone askew, that people are reporting they're \"level x\" autism, because unless you weren't given the correct information, or both your levels are the same, there isn't a \"level 1 autism\".\n\nI get the feeling a lot of people use \"level 1\" as short hand to refer to being \"low needs\", but here's the kicker, the DSM levels DO NOT correspond to \"needs\", but to \"severity of symptoms\". There's obviously SOME correlation there, but the point is it's not exactly neuro-affirming to define a person by deficit-based language. The neuro-affirming/ neurodiversity movement is not yet consistently incorporated into practice and policy, but we ARE on the cusp of that happening! Diagnostic criteria and resources are always being re-evaluated, and it's my hope that the next DSM incorporates a more\n\nneuro-affirming element.\n\nOne level could not encapsulate the entirety of the autistic experience, and nor does two. The level system IS an upgrade from what came before, but is still widely regarded as problematic for many reasons.\n\n\n--- anothrr comment that gives exmples \n\n\nAutism isn't a monolith and every autistic person varies in their autistic experience.

The level 1 openly stims and the level 2 does not. Either one could enjoy or dislike kid shows. A level 3 needs a communication device and has severe dyspraxia so they sometimes need help with mobility and executive function tasks. They also openly stim and perform echolalia.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "Marketing and promotions can include anything that explicitly mentions the product and should vary depending on the context of what is implied. Saying “I made a book” from an anonymous profile without mentioning your name anywhere is not the same as saying “I made the book titled X, it is sold on Amazon for 20 euros.” It is more difficult to consider if, for example, the advertising is indirect (enter the profile and see what book it is even if it is not in the post, for example), and then it would depend completely on the context.\n\nFor screenshots, I think it's okay, because it helps a lot of people understand things that we ourselves don't understand, and they shouldn't bother anyone (if you don't like it, keep scrolling)\n\nFor generative AI: if you ban text, you're going to screw a lot of people. I use Reedit's translator because my English is shit, I wouldn't want to be indirectly banned from making long posts if that translator used generative AI (which I honestly don't know if it uses or not, but it's a great translator built into the app that allowed me to start using Reedit more actively) just because I don't have a B2 in English yet. And also, I think there are people who use it for accessibility. Personally I find it absurd, especially when even Reedit has its own generative AI: just by commenting here you are training it. With the images I suppose there is not so much of a problem, although it still seems like a populist measure to me in general. You will gain people's acceptance and perhaps you yourselves will agree, but at least don't screw those of us who use it for things like the ones I mentioned before, please.\n\nI say this especially because I've been accused of being AI in the past, and in this very subreddit (when I always write everything I want to express without putting it through any AI, I don't like to do that, except if you consider AI the translation plugin I mentioned before, I never use any for this), and I wouldn't want to get banned for something I don't do just because it \"seems like\", or have to argue with mods.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "Yup. Very hypersexual most of my life. I have a hefty amount of sexual trauma that came from that as well though. \n\nIn my early 40s I started reckoning with the fact my mother is the reason I’m drawn to toxic cluster b’s. Started putting up boundaries &amp; cutting the controlling stressors in my life (her &amp; assorted other family members). \n\nI also suspect there was a hormone shift somewhere around then. I feel like it was a testosterone drop &amp; it’s still low bc getting that treated has proven impossible. \n\nI was gay/ bi/ pan most of my life but stopped dating males altogether somewhere around 2014/15 when I started sorting out that sex &amp; emotion were two separate things for me. Neither had anything to do with the other for most of my life. \n\nI realized that I was not emotionally attracted to males &amp; with the hypersexual dissipating, I had no desire to date them or fuck them. \n\nSo lesbian it was. But then… I found myself kicking women outta my bed in the middle of the night bc I’d all of a sudden not want to be anywhere near another human &amp; I felt suffocated. \n\nThen I had to sort out how I felt about dating altogether. I realized our society as a whole was compulsory coupledom. There was something wrong with you if you weren’t dating someone or something missing if you weren’t in a relationship. But I realized I didn’t actually feel that way, I had just been following society’s lead. \n\nSo when I started stripping everything out &amp; examining why I did things, during my extracting my covert narc mother from the enmeshment that existed there that evaluation of what I liked and wanted bleed to all parts of my life. From Christmas rituals to the idea that if you haven’t found “the one” you should be looking bc you’re not complete without a mate. \n\nWith a lot of work with a therapist I pushed out the ‘must couple up’ indoctrination. They gave me a task at some point which was to show myself the love using the 5 love languages. Essentially dating myself. \n\nWell that fucked me up for dating going forward bc I am the best girlfriend I’ve ever had. I’m also an introvert that had been masquerading as an extrovert due to the level of masking I’d been doing since birth. Respecting the introversion edged out some of the need to be with someone. \n\nI’m also kinky af though but I don’t need/ want sex anywhere near the amount I did for most of my life. And trusting another human to the degree I like to bang is next to impossible for me at this point. Plus coming across a lesbian that matches my kink is really impossible, esp in the Deep South. \n\nSo I became my own sexual partner when I was needing some sex. I have a toy and apparatus collection that intimidates tf outta most lesbians, or any sexual partner really. Plus I have top / dom energy but am not that. Unfortunately folks were drawn to me in that regard. Alas, two bottoms/ subs don’t really have a fulfilling sex life. \n\nToday I bang tf outta myself like once every few months or so maybe, I also give myself multiple orgasm quickies on the occasion I just wanna get off but don’t wanna go through the whole kink collection to get there. \n\nDating though? I don’t know if I’ll ever do that again. I forget it’s a thing ppl do really. I have little to zero desire bc that comes with behaviors &amp; expectations that I have no desire to experience again, at least not rn. The idea of another human touching me sexually mostly repels me. Sharing my time &amp; space with someone sounds suffocating. \n\nI haven’t had any sort of relations, even dates/ kissing or even flirtation really in like 8 yrs. There was one case maybe 4yrs or so ago but it was such a major let down compared to my own sexual escapades with myself that I have not had any real desire to try again since. \n\nAt first I missed being hypersexual bc sex &amp; sexuality &amp; flirting etc was such a big part of my life &amp; who I was really. That was a decade ago at this point though &amp; today the idea of even going on a date or dealing with another human to have some sex feels suffocating &amp; exhausting. \n\nToday I just date myself &amp; I show myself love in a variety of ways. I’ve even taken to using that to get enough dopamine to do tasks I don’t want to do. They become acts of service for my future self &amp; expressions of gratitude to past self for doing a thing I didn’t want to do for me. \n\nAt this point as far as labels go, I mostly align with demisexual, aromantic, &amp; lesbian. \n\nI also get uncomfortable watching kissing or making out or romantic scenes in media but the porn I favor is levels of kink &amp; bdsm that I don’t think I’d even be capable of in real life today, but those sorts of fantasies are the only way I can fully get myself off.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "Wooo, couldn’t be me 😅 I think a lot of this comes from assumptions about autism. People tend to think that because we might struggle to read emotions or express them “normally,” we somehow don’t feel love, attraction, or desire… therefore sex just doesn’t happen for us. Which is a wild leap.\n\nAutism ≠ asexuality. There is overlap for sure, but it’s not a rule. I’m autistic and very much not ace. I’ve had a pretty high body count, mostly because I used sex as a reliable dopamine button. Novelty, intensity, stimulation, all that good brain-chemistry stuff.\n\nAs for SpongeBob Stephen Hillenburg, stated that he considered the character to be \"almost asexual,\" because hewas aiming for funny, innocent, child-friendly characters, not promoting a specific sexuality, he just wanted characters that were entertaining. But SpongeBob, flirts, blushes, gets jealous, simps hard, and has multiple episodes where he’s clearly romantically or sexually coded. He literally falls in love, goes on dates, and has fantasy sequences about attraction. That’s not “no attraction,” that’s just not heteronormative adult human sexuality.\n\nAnd as mentioned because Stephen wanted a show that was entertaining and child friendly, it's a kids’ cartoon universe where sex is obviously abstracted. If SpongeBob were human-coded, most people wouldn’t read him as ace. They read him as ace because he’s goofy, emotionally expressive, and non-masculine.\n\nWhich kind of mirrors how autistic people get labeled asexual. Not because we are, but because we don’t perform desire in the expected way.\n\nSo yeah. Some autistic people are ace, some aren’t.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "What a horrible situation; I am so sorry you are going through this. Truly. \n\nThe hard truth as I see it, and this is anecdotal because it’s based on my own experience, but once someone has gone that far down the pipeline, the right has them and they’re not saveable. \n\nI used to be right-leaning. I wasn’t very political, but was one of those typical, white, straight, male “pull yourself up by the bootstraps” types who thought everyone was treated relatively equally and given the same opportunities. So if someone was struggling with addiction or unhoused, my tendency was to think they were making a choice and it was on them. \n\nFast forward through a change in political leaning, as well as a mental health diagnosis and treatments, and I can’t believe I was as far right as I was. I wasn’t raised that way, it came about through exposure, through the alt-right pipeline on the internet and the skewing of media. \n\nAs bad as I was, it was when I realized I was losing empathy for people based on ideas that didn’t really sit that well with me in the first place that I decided I needed to challenge my own beliefs and get informed. What I found was losing empathy starts by accepting a boogeyman propped up by media and others as the reason for your troubles. \n\nOnce you can successfully dehumanize a group because of their perceived transgressions against your way of life, it’s easier to lose empathy. Eventually it becomes much less hard to hate them. Over time those feelings metastasize like cancer. It starts with group a, but soon you realize they’re not the only boogeyman who’s “ruining your way of life” and soon there are all kinds of people you hate. \n\nMany of us have such unhealthy levels of frustration, fear, and anger about the way the world is right now that seeking catharsis makes sense. When you’re handed a scapegoat you can punch down on, for many people that’s too attractive a solution, too fitting for their existent personal biases, that they give in to it and just let the hate win them over. \n\nI’m sure it feels good to have a target they can actually attack. Something to focus their anger on. The entire time they are focusing on hating a group that’s less privileged than them, those who are more privileged than they are, are doing the same thing. \n\nThe wealthy elite not only look down on and mock average people. They hate us. They think we’re stupid, disgusting and pathetic. Easy to manipulate, lazy, dirty, diseased. \n\nThe anomaly that needs to change here isn’t the vast majority of people; it’s the wealthy elites who think we’re too weak and pathetic to do anything about it. \n\nAnd mostly, they’re right. Especially when so many of us can’t see that our fear and prejudice is fed like a fire, used to weaponize our own suffering and in turn, re-focus new suffering on those less privileged than us. \n\nHierarchies seem normal until you understand the systems that enable and support them, and truly realize your part on them.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768070665.0, "id": "nytx78f", "author": "ThickestTea"}

Took a long time to get to where I'm at now. Have had many failed friendships and relationships, many hardships and struggles, both mentally and physically. Have had many terrible jobs that broke me down so bad. My last job I was at the very end of my rope. But I got a new job a year and some change ago that I love. It's flexible, my bosses are kind and caring, it has its rough moments but overall is a very good fit for me. Having a good job improved my mental health by so much. To anyone working a job that is draining them, I empathize, and I urge you to look elsewhere, for your sake.\n\nMy mental health isn't perfect. My anxiety can get pretty bad some days. I'm socially awkward, I don't have many friends, and the ones I have I feel like there is some kind of disconnect between us sometimes. I'm hard on myself, I ruminate on situations. I fall out of routine easily and struggle with motivation. I'm always tired. I have adhd as well, medicine helps a bit, but some days I come home from work and get stuck sitting on my couch scrolling until bed time because I'm so exhausted. Other days I manically clean or work on an art project until way too late at night. I'm also bad at maintaining my responsibilities like doctor visits, taxes, paperwork, insurance, savings. I'm getting better though.\n\nBut I've made a nice home for myself in my tiny apartment, although my taste is very eclectic to some, it's decorated to my liking, it's perfect for me and my dog.

Before we start no I do not hate LSN autistics. This is about us working as a community.\n\n1. Please for the love of god stop calling sterotypical presentations in media bad representation. Mostly talking about Shawn and Sheldon here. They're extremely relatable to a lot of autistic people including me. I saw a post discussing how to write autism and they listed \"only talks about his interests\" as a bad trait and I'm still shocked. Like wow thanks. Also you need to accept that some autistic characters will drool, be chilish, be non verbal, visibly stim, be loud etc. The pushback against these traits has made so many people refuse to write stories portraying characters with these traits.\n\n\n2. Feel free to use AAC. I do not give a shit why you are using it. If it makes you comfy go right ahead. \n\n3. Stop making the level up joke. Its disrespectful and hurtful. \n\n4. Please assume competency. If you meet a higher support needs autistic please don't jump in to help unless they look like they're actively struggling. I was at an art group for autistic teens and we were taking a drink break. This one kid offered to fill my cup for me and no one else. I was the most visibly autistic. This threw me off to the point I couldn't actually fill my cup and needed her help. \n\n5. Please understand for a lot of lsn autistics you can preform tasks with normalcy, it \"just\" exhausts you. For a lot of MSN and HSN the problem is we literally can't. I cannot mask. I cannot care for my hair so its shaved now. I cannot put on complicated clothes. I cannot tie my shoes. I cannot speak. I cannot tolerate classroom level noise. I cannot clean myself effectively. I cannot tell when clothes need cleaning. It isn't that we choose to do this. It is that we can't no matter how much abuse and sufferrung we go through.\n\n6. Don't tell us you're being XYZ or just stop *insert bad behaviour.* That isn't freaking helpful. I can't just stop absconding or physically lashing out during meltdowns because it is disruptive. If you want to give advice, give something actionable. Eg bring a hospital bag everywhere. Get medical ID etc.\n\n7. We need you to advocate for us. I can't come to rallys. Doctors won't listen to me. Some issues I would like discussed: \n\n- How therapy is inaccessible and how doctors have no clue how to treat autistic people other than restraining us.\n\n- How AAC is pricy\n\n- How there isn't enough educational reasources for us.\n\n7. Stop saying oh but autistics don't do (insert embarassing or otherwise scary autistic behaviour here). Eg empathy, not washing, loud meltdowns etc. Just say some autistics don't do that\n\n", "score": 108, "num_comments": 90, "created_utc": 1768051180.0, "id": "1q93vi8", "author": "10_Screaming_Foxes", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q93vi8/more_stuff_a_msn_autistic_wished_lsn_autistics/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I’ve tried to write this response three or four times today, and I’m still upset, so I want to be clear about why.\n\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is posts that list a series of negative behaviors about a group I belong to, framed in a way that implies those behaviors are typical of everyone in that group. Some individuals may do some of those things, that’s true of *any* group, but when I read a list like this and see none of my own behaviors reflected, what I hear is an assumption that you think the group is bad and therefore I am bad.\n\nThat’s why phrasing like “I don’t want to hate LSN autistics, but…” is a problem. It functions the same way as “bless your heart” or “with all due respect”: everything that follows is a list of grievances. Whatever the intent, the effect is still “here’s what’s wrong with you.”\n\nThe other issue I have is this: all autistic people, by definition, struggle with social interaction. Many of the examples given here are failed social interactions: poorly timed help, awkward offers, misread situations, and clumsy interactions. That’s autism. That’s not malice; sometimes it’s just someone being autistic badly in that moment.\n\nSo I want to ask an honest question:  \nIf those same behaviors were done by an MSN or HSN autistic person, would they be judged the same way or would they be given grace as a poorly worded, poorly timed, or socially awkward interaction?\n\nBecause if grace were extended in one case but not the other, then what’s really happening is that LSN autistics are being held to a higher social standard, expected to anticipate impact perfectly, respond correctly every time, and never make another autistic person uncomfortable.\n\nThat’s not realistic. I cannot promise anyone, allistic or autistic, that every interaction with me will feel good, smooth, or affirming. I can’t promise I won’t say the wrong thing, misunderstand a situation, or act in a way that confuses or upsets someone. I can’t even promise that to the people closest to me. I’m autistic. Social awkwardness is part of that. To be frank, I make all of the people uncomfortable some of the time and some of the people uncomfortable all of the time. \n\nI strive in every way to be a good person. If I feel I have hurt another person, I hurt and beat myself up over it. It's one of the things that makes autism hard... It's like I am a large elephant that is forced to stand in a small china shop. I desperately don't want to break anything... but somehow I do. I thought that would be something other autistics would understand.\n\nWhat I think we should be offering each other is mutual grace. Grace to screw up socially. Grace to misread. Grace to be awkward. Grace to not always behave perfectly. \n\nAdvocating for HSN and MSN needs is essential. But doing so by framing LSN autistics as a problem group doesn’t build solidarity. I don't understand why this post doesn't violate the rules and why people view this as something to upvote. Everything said in this is a negative attack on LSN autistics. We are not universally bad people. If a post was just a list of grievances about MSNs or HSNs and said only negative things, the post would be removed. What I am hearing in this post and seeing in the response is that we matter less to this community. We are only to be \"seen and not heard\". We need to make our behavior fit the community's expectations. It's almost like you want me to wear a special mask just for you... It makes me tired. If being part of the autistic community means I have to mask, then...

My family is matriarchal, and women were nearly always the role models.  In high school, most of my friends were gay or women -- usually they were gay women.  I'd get stoned with my friends after school, and sometimes, I'd become convinced that I was a woman, but that the only person who knew about it was me.  I'd sit there and think, \"how do they not know I'm a woman?\"\n\nI thought about these feelings quite a lot, but they didn't feel urgent enough to act on. I DID discuss them with my sex ed teacher, who later transitioned, and he just said, \"it's normal to be confused.  Stop worrying, you'll figure it out\"  Which was exactly what I needed to hear at the time.  \n  \nIn college, well...I went to college in 2001, and it was this tiny, radical queer school in the middle of nowhere.  we were encouraged to fuck with our gender roles, so I did, because it was fun.  But the freedom to wear makeup and women's clothes without any penalty convinced me I wasn't especially interested in doing that full-time.  At one point, probably a quarter of the people on campus began to transition.  It was an odd moment, because in the early 2000's, there wasn't the language to describe what was happening, like there is now.\n\nNow, it's much more common.

It's not perfect, but it's also better than I would have imagined when I was in school 20-something years ago.\n\nIt's been really nice to see gen z loosening gendered styles.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "trans basically means \"different from birth sex\" (not gender as sex and gender are two things). non-binary means that you fit outside of the \"man/woman\" binary; aka it's not rigid. i think it helps if you dont view non-binary as a \"third gender\" but more as an adverb or a specifier in this case\n\ni myself am a trans masculine non binary person. what that means for me is that i use traditionally masculine terms for myself, dress traditionally masculine and want to be seen as a man to others. i have plans for surgery and HRT down the line once i get other aspects of my life in order but socially i use he/him pronouns and dont dress as \"girlish\". why i am non-binary is because i dont fully relate to a binary trans man/binary cis man. i still want to explore femininity, dress cute, put on make up and wear dresses sometimes but not be seen as a \"girl\" while i do those things. the other reason why i am non-binary is that i just dont particularly care about gender that much. i want to be seen a certain way and my body to look a certain way for myself but i dont want that to be my focal point for others if i make sense\n\nthe nuance about the queer community is that labels arent as rigid and definite as you may think they are. it depends on the person and are as vague and fluid as the individual wants them to be. for queer people and people in general, a label is something that is made to fit you, not you fitting into the label as that is restrictive. sometimes labels are contradictory and you just wont understand everything which is okay, theres no need to (i dont understand every label queer people use but i leave them alone as it's not for me). as long as you have basic respect thast all that matters. \n\nhopefully that makes sense! sorry for the long explanation", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768081981.0, "id": "nyuzipo", "author": "IJS_Reddit"}

I overlooked it thinking maybe she was trying to match my energy possibly autistic like me or socially awkward.\n\nAll three of them would go out of their way to talk to me like they’d learned my name on day one somehow before I even knew their names. And talked to be often about stuff like how nice I look. Asking what lessons I’m doing because we were in a different class. They would talk to me a lot as a group. I thought we were good friends. They even added me to a groupchat. Came up with characters we are like and nicknames for eachother. They’d talk about my social media posts.\n\nOne day I’d just finished a lesson. The other three girls lessons didn’t start till later in the day but one of them was sitting on her own because she was very early. I sat next to her to start a conversation. She looked embarrassed to be with me. It was so awkward. She sat in silence. I tried to start a conversation but she wouldn’t contribute at all to the conversation. So we just sat there in silence as she was messaging people and giggling. She took a picture of me “sneakily” at one point. After awkwardly sitting there for like 5 minutes I was like I’m going to get lunch now she didn’t say anything.\n\nWhen I came back from lunch the other two girls were there and all three of them were giggling together. One of them stopped me and asked what I had for lunch. I said a sandwich. She said she’s suprised she thought I’d have a burger or whatever greasy food they have in the cafeteria that day. I laughed it off saying the sandwiches are nice and she said “I bet”. She then asked where my Starbucks drink is.\n\nI said didn’t get a Starbucks today. She said she’s shocked she’s never seen me without a frappe in my hand (I had a frappe 3 times in college). All three of them were laughing and I again laughed it off even though it seemed very much they were laughing at not with me.\n\nA different day we both had the same break. Me,them and a few other people were talking. A different girl asked everyone what their bodycount is. I answered. It was then time for me and the other people except for those 3 to go to class. Before I went to class though I went to the toilet. The 3 girls came in and because I was supposed to be in lesson guess they didn’t think it would be me in the stall. They started talking about how funny I am. Decided to take it as a compliment until they started making fun of my speech impediment. How socially awkward I am. How much crap I eat and they’re suprised I’m not fat. About how they’re suprised I’m not a virgin and if I have sex that gives hope to one of them who’s a virgin. I felt really betrayed.\n\nAfter they left I just cried. I didn’t go to my next class and went home instead and cried some more and got pretty drunk.\n\nIt hurt so much. It was honestly embarrassing. I called them my friends. I told people how sweet they are. I made appreciation posts on social media for them. They invited me to sleepovers with them we did eachothers hair and makeup. Called me their “bestie” I thought we were? It’s honestly humiliating. I guess I wanted friends so badly I looked past the warning sings this time. I’m so sad even still. I don’t go to the college anymore but it’s still upsetting me.", "score": 286, "num_comments": 16, "created_utc": 1768017629.0, "id": "1q8tzck", "author": "No-Dream9806", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q8tzck/i_thought_they_were_my_friends_im_so_embarrassed/"}

That wasn't easy, that was back in 94, before interwebs really took off. That was right at the beginning. I downloaded the magic mushroom growers guide, as well. \n\nI don't know what it is exactly about it that i like. I have had my most profound breakthroughs in the past couple of years, using it.  I just found out 2 years ago i was asd, when i was 50.\n\nI had used it on and off over the years. I eventually get tired of it and the side effects and i quit. Then i come back. \n\nIt does several things for me. I need a seed to really get ruminating. My ocd and the thc take over.  That \"host\" thought then allows my parallel channels to open, and i get to figuring shit out. It's like when I'm doing a project and my project focus allows a couple other parallel thought processes to start.  Basically, when i focus on one thing, i figure other things out without thinking about them. I know it sounds weird, but i don't know how else to describe it.\n I have alexithymia, and using thc i have been able to parse some of my emotions out from the pack.  I know what anxiety feels like now, and i recognize how it makes me act poorly. \n\nFor some reason, i seem not to be bothered by things as much  (throughout the day, not just while using).\n\nI am gifted, so I'm still far above my co-workers even with the thc holding me back (i don't like to talk about that).  I do notice it hinders my memory.\n\nWhile using it, i get relief from my effing brain!!  Does everybody ruminate on EVERYTHING ALL THE TIME!?!  Wtf, even!?  I can create problems that aren't there! (Catastrophization) \n\nIt does cause anxiety, though. I mean, it's chemistry. You flood your shit with dopamine and your body won't produce as much, like with hypogonadism. You'd think bigger testicles would mean more testosterone, but it is the exact opposite. Your testes enlarge to produce more testosterone, because you're low. In fact, small testicles are a sign you're not having issues producing hormones.\n\nOnce i figured out what anxiety felt like, i started noticing my levels modulate.  When i quit? Holy shit, i don't want to do anything to myself, but I'm pretty depressed for a week or two, until my body is able to get its levels evened out.\n\nI don't know how old you are, but today's weed is not the weed i grew up on. I was smoking 8 or 9% stuff, not 40!\n\nWho's gonna get hooked harder, the guy drinking 3 beers a day or the guy drinking 3 whiskeys a day? The problem is tolerance-  this high potency stuff increases your tolerance so FAST!  \n\nI don't smoke anymore, i use carts or vape flower. I also don't even remember the last time i got stoned.

Have a conversation with yourself, or do a type of journaling where you ask yourself questions and answer them.  After you get the first answer though, you have to dig deeper.  I find that I have to go probably 3-5 levels deep before I figure out why I'm mad.\n\nFor example, I was actually angry this past week when my co-workers called into work again.  Over the past 3 weeks, there have been only a handful of days where someone didn't call out, and I only have 4 other people in my department now.  Eventually I figured out by having a conversation with myself that I was initially angry because they kept calling out and my boss didn't seem to care.  Ok, but that wasn't why I was angry.  I like these people and would rather they not get in trouble.  Then it was I didn't want to get a dressing down because we were behind on our work, which while true, wasn't the real reason.  Finally I figured that I was feeling taken advantage of because for the past 3 weeks I've been having to do twice as much work just to not fall even further behind.  After that, I wasn't mad anymore.  I told myself that I can only do so much, and that I wouldn't push myself to the point of exhaustion because my coworkers couldn't show up for work like they were supposed to.  Basically, I felt like I had to take responsibility for their actions and that was what made me angry.  I let that go and accepted that \"it is what it is\".\n\nOne thing to keep in mind.  Anger isn't caused by other people or situations.  Anger comes from within as a response to other people or situations, and we always have the ability to control and release that anger.  Anger is often caused because you or other people don't live up to the expectations-often unconcious or based in beliefs we don't even know we have-that we have for ourselves and others.  Once you understand what belief or expectation drives the anger, it's much easier to let it go.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768077116.0, "id": "nyuj7in", "author": "LordTalesin"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I’ve been into nudism my whole life. It always just felt right to me. Nudity wasn’t really accepted when I got to be older than like 6, so I kept doing it in secret. Warm summer nights for example. I went to a nude beach when I first got my drivers license and that became the place I felt comfortable swimming. No wet bathing suits!\n\nA few years ago, I learned there was a nudist resort near-ish (see [the AANR website](https://aanr.com) to find one near you!) and decided to go one day. I was nervous as fuck, but it was instantly ok. \n\nThe feeling is incredible. It makes me feel grounded. It’s one of the only places I feel like I can unwind. I hate the feeling of clothes on my body, but sun and wind are fantastic. I don’t have to decide what to wear. It’s an environment of non-judgement. People explicitly respect boundaries and don’t really approach people who are doing their own thing, but will always be inclusive in group activities. Like I can read next to the pool all day and no one will bother me. But if there’s a volleyball game that breaks out in the pool, I know I’d be instantly welcomed. It’s the opposite of the playground in my experience. \n\nI like to go places that have nude hiking trails and camping. I’d like to visit one with a hot spring eventually. Over the summer, I went to a nude music festival. There are lots of different ways to try!", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768083164.0, "id": "nyv3j7a", "author": "Whole_Lifeguard_6046"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "AuDHD* Life Pro Tip: When upset by sudden changes, ask yourself “is this a snow globe?”", "text": "[Cross-posted in r/healthygamergg]\n\n*This life tip was specifically conceived with AuDHD/Autism in mind, but is still relevant and potentially helpful for everyone.\n\nI had an epiphany this afternoon that I need to write down and share, in hopes it helps others, if only to ease my annoyance at not having thought of it sooner for my own sake.\n\nBackstory: I (37F) and my son (10M) are both AuDHD (Autistic + ADHD), and we share story-relevant struggles with impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and difficulties with sudden changes or subverted expectations. We \nlive with my parents (I was adopted at birth, and essentially the Loki of the family), and my mom (67F) has a *very* hard time understanding or empathizing with our differences, generally making default assumptions of us both being “spoiled brats” when we respond to her words/actions in ways that show our distress of displeasure, even when we try to be polite about it.\n\nI’ve gotten pretty good about not holding it against her, being highly skilled at playing “devil’s advocate,” and do my best to problem-solve from both sides of these situations to clear up what almost always amounts to simple misunderstandings stemming from our mismatched neurobiological operating systems. Because I was late-diagnosed, being able to be proactive on my son’s behalf has been a core aspect of my own healing journey, and so I’ve always made it a point to turn these situations into learning opportunities for my son, to help him build up his empathy, perspective-taking, and ability to discern when things should/shouldn’t be taken personally, in addition to coming up with self-regulation and coping strategies.\n\nThe Situation: After narrowly defeating my son in a game of Magic: The Gathering (my werewolves managed to overrun his dinosaurs for a nice change) and declining to play a game of Uno before karate, I sent the disappointed lad upstairs to get changed. He returned in a random tee (not his usual one from his dojo) and *jeans* (/facepalm) because he couldn’t find his uniform. This was when my mom informed him that she had rearranged his dresser drawers while he was at school, moving his shoes from the bottom drawer to one of his new under-bed storage bins, and his karate uniform and other similarly bulky clothing into the bottom drawer. His annoyance at being sent back to change a second time turned to outrage as he exclaimed that he’d had it all organized the way he wanted it (nothing disrespectful, but he made his displeasure and distress known loudly).\n\nAs he stomped back up the stairs, I shook my head as I put our Magic stuff away, telling my mom that at some point she’d have to learn to expect this kind of reaction to moving our stuff around. She (fairly) retorted that his drawers were becoming overstuffed, and I countered that they shouldn’t be *if he put his clothes back correctly* (an admittedly very big “if”). She came back with the usual remark about him being a spoiled brat about it, and I reminded her that this was just him being Autistic and struggling with sudden changes. She returned her customary complaint about my “excuses,” to which I reminded her that having our stuff moved sends our brains into a panicked distress, sending us spiraling in the overwhelming feeling that we don’t know where *any* of our stuff is anymore—should doesn’t enter into it, it just is what it is, so she should expect that. She told me not to lecture her, and I told her I wasn’t (even though I could), and that I wasn’t even saying she did anything wrong, just that she should adjust her expectations.\n\nThe Epiphany: I went upstairs to talk other my son about how we could go through his storage tomorrow and figure out what-all he wants to store in the new bins, and what he can shuffle around in other storage places, etc., and asked him if after having a little time to get used to the idea of he thought maybe his grandma had kind of cooked with her idea after all, and he begrudgingly agreed the new arrangement was better than the old one. So I started telling him when we got back downstairs he should apologize for snapping at her and let her know that once he got used to the idea, he liked her way better, and to thank her for helping, etc., and as I started explaining to him why changes like that can be so disorienting and upsetting for us, I suddenly thought of what might just be the perfect analogy—the snow globe.\n\nI told him to imagine what it might be like for someone who’d never seen a snow globe before to visit their grandma’s house, where their cousins picks up this very expensive, delicate looking decorative sculpture and starts shaking the crap out of it, terrified they’re about to be in so much trouble this act of wanton destruction appears to have dislodged the paint from the internal components… but as they watch the swirling flakes begin to settle, they start to realize that this was the gimmick of the thing: the flakes are actually pieces of snowflake glitter, the snow-covered miniature houses inside still fully intact and pristinely enameled—and by the time the snowflakes settle, their initial panicked anguish has given way to minor annoyance at their cousin’s mean prank, if not outright wonder at this new discovery.\n\nSudden changes in our plans, routines, and expectations are upsetting in the same way the act of upending a snow globe upsets the glitter within; by making a habit of taking a moment to ask ourselves if this situation is perhaps a snow globe type of situation, we can buy ourselves the time needed to allow the initial shock to subside and give ourselves a chance to reevaluate the situation when we’re calmer. This also helps us to avoid saying something in the moment that we may regret as a nice little side benefit. After taking a few minutes to process the disruption, we’re better able to gauge whether it’s fine, actually (a snow globe situation) or an actual problem; in the latter case, this gives us the chance to problem-solve more effectively, or at least collect ourselves to better withstand the misery.\n\nNow I’m more than a little annoyed I didn’t think of this about 5 years ago when I went back to college, but apparently I only get to have good ideas when problem-solving for my kid (which is fair tbh), so I thought I’d share it with all of you as well.", "score": 118, "num_comments": 11, "created_utc": 1768018762.0, "id": "1q8udik", "author": "CatalogK9", "url": "https://i.redd.it/3lj5kyai7gcg1.jpeg"}

They broke up with me eventually but I think it’s because I never really communicated the issues I was having because of how they responded early on. I literally kept feeling anxious around them. I didn’t verbalize when I was having issues because of the facial expressions he would make when I said some things. And I wanted to ask him what his facial expressions meant but that made me feel embarrassed. I was super clingy but I repressed that because he verbally said he wanted to spend a lot of time with friends. At the end of the day we were incompatible as people but I couldn’t even talk to him about our incompatibility because everything I did felt like rejection even though it wasn’t. It was mostly in my head because he made me so insecure. I was so scared of losing him I would get horrible stomach issues and experienced a two year burn out after we broke up. \n\nNow I am married to another man. I have to stim a lot.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "My dad is yelling at and punishing me disproportionately for my meltdowns (cw: suicidal ideation, verbal emotional and physical abuse, ableism)", "text": "Hi, \n\nSo I think I (15F) have autistic rage, I get angry and often have outbursts from a mix of involuntary anger issues, and conscious desires to be heard or change something I think is unfair. And after my Honors English class started considering moving me out due to disruption and concern for me, not only did my parents (50M, 48F) lie that they were kicking me out as punishment for my outbursts and emphasized the disruption issue way more than the teachers did, but my dad yelled at me really bad with insults, slapped me lightly when I mouthed him off (I believed he was unfair and was letting him know he was probably being ableist), and made a new thing where he expects me to never have another outburst again. While I did start getting better control, I fell again many times, usually one-offs but now the outbursts are coming back again.\n\nYesterday I had a really bad outburst loop (have an outburst, upset because of it, upset makes me feel like Ill have another, loop) due to pms and an assignment in English I perceived as unfair, with suicidal thoughts bc I wasnt sure if I was abusive, like I was nearing acting on these but wouldnt because I was scared to die, and I let people know in my outbursts because I felt like I needed support, my social skills iep teachers refused to let me go to the counselor until I told them I was texting 988, I then got in trouble again for texting 988 while in the WAITING ROOM of the counselors office, my counselor told my dad everything and LAUGHED about the fact I was scared to die (did she think it was fake???) and seemed to agree with everything whatever my dad said on call (he does NOT have good takes). He then picked me up early for some reason and I KNEW he was mad so I didnt make eye contact, or talk with him the whole ride, I didnt even turn up music. I then quietly put my backpack and stuff down gave him my devices when asked and then went to my room and hid avoided talking to him about this for 10 hours.\n\nSo that evening I said \"hey Im sorry for what happened at school today, whats going to happen now?\" (I didnt know how long my stuff would be taken for). yeah he fucking yelled at me, insulted me, said he wanted me to suffer, and said he was gonna keep my devices and sell them. which he obviously didnt do but I was terrified he might. he often makes fake insane threats (no physical violence threats) like these when he gets mad, he never acts on them but like idk if hes finally gonna do it this time. He calmed down pretty quickly while he was talking to me which is rare, and eventually he gave my devices back (my iPad last night and my phone today). I might’ve gotten my devices sooner if I talked to him sooner but I was terrified. he has mentioned he wants to punish me heavily in the future for this by taking them away for longer but these are usually empty threats.\n\nHe often makes crazy punishment threats, regrets them later, and lifts all punishments. its very weird and I fall for it each time. Idk if hell punish me harder in the future for this. and if you’re wondering my mom is better but not much, she has her yelling moments too but theyre in different circumstances, less bad in general, still some empty threat crap but less often. And she doesnt care when dad does it. Dad also makes further threats like \"yeah you better run\" or escalate to violence but usually USUALLY this happens when he gets really mad (takes more than an outburst to trigger) and I escalate it by fighting. Also he gets really REALLY mad when I tell people at school about what he does, he says Im \"telling part of the story and hes actually loving\", \"making him look bad incorrectly\", and that Im gonna get us separated by CPS, which thinking about it now, why would he care so much if I talk about it??? suspicious…\n\nThank you in advance❤️", "score": 6, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768074930.0, "id": "1q9dtqt", "author": "Z3N1TY", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q9dtqt/my_dad_is_yelling_at_and_punishing_me/"}

As some others have said, people sometimes might find it creepy that I remember some random thing they said or did years ago. In some instances I've been concerned that others don't remember events at all. It can be isolating when things feel important to remember, but others forget. \n\nI have worse memory when it comes to numbers. That's probably the average these days so it doesn't really affect me much. When it comes to special interests, some things I can remember but others I forget easily. It's really frustrating because I want to understand and dive deeper into certain subjects, but I just can't remember too many specifics, especially when it comes to elements I'm not that great at or that interested in on their own. The problem could also be that I'm not using learning skills akin to what you'd use in school/academics. \n\nMy memory helped me a lot in school and it's easy for me to learn new ideas and connect them to previous ones. My recall is generally very good. It's like my brain is a web network, with many tags applied to each little snippet of information or memory, so it doesn't take much for me to form connections between ideas and expand on my understanding of them. Or maybe it's like a bunch of filing cabinets, which my neurons sort themselves and take folders out as needed. Except some neurons decide they're going to make a mess of things or get side tracked on the wrong thing at the wrong time, and start tossing out random folders into my active consciousness to distract me (and this includes traumatizing memories, me thinking of all the embarrassing things I've ever done, etc.) Sometimes the distractions are good (i.e., special interests). But when I get the urge to speak about them but can't or no one has interest, it just hurts. It's like that filing cabinet is overstuffed, and I'm forcing it closed and locking it, all the papers inside trying to force it open (and eventually they will in one way or another as the cabinet can't maintain the pressure)...same thing for emotions if I try to suppress them.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767969087.0, "id": "nylnxz8", "author": "ApprehensiveBench483"}

I felt like the memory tests they used didn’t translate well to real life memory tasks, and it just hit me why. At least in my case, I was given visuals *or* audio to listen to in a sterile, uninterrupted environment. They tested my memory by giving me a few minutes in complete silence, or a period where we did another task, before I had to recall things again. That’s not how I use my memory day-to-day. Whenever I’m taking in that kind of sensory information, I always have to filter it out from all kinds of noise or activities that are happening around me at the same time. I might not be able to give my full attention to whatever I need to remember in the first place. Even if I can, I usually have to hold onto that through more simultaneous or more complex tasks/stimuli at once before I have to recall it again.

It's your parents responsibility to help him learn to more appropriately self soothe, and while it's admirable for you to want to help, your own priority should be your own safety. \n\nI will also add that a lot of the time, during pre-meltdown high emotions, suggestions for how to solve the problem are often more overwhelming than anything else. A lot of us get stuck in a \"it wasn't supposed to be this way\" loop, that, until our brains move past that, or we develop skills to force our brains to move past it, we can't accept solutions. Providing emotional support like \"That really sucks, it wasn't supposed to be that way, let's get you somewhere comforting/distract you/lower your sensory input\" is often more effective than providing immediate solutions.\n\nAs far as an actual solution to this particular issue:\n\nWe build Lego a lot in my household, but we haven't done the titanic set. I don't know if your brother is upset because the number of pieces is historically inaccurate or if he's missing pieces he's supposed to have according to the instructions.\n\nIf the set did not have all the pieces, while it will take time to receive them, you can simply email Lego to ask for them. They typically ship things like that out free of charge. If this is the case, and you need help figuring out how to email Lego, pop over to r/Lego and I'm sure someone there can help you out. \n\nIf it's because of historical inaccuracy, you can also still order the individual pieces from Lego, but they may charge for that. You can ask about this in the same sub I mentioned in the previous paragraph.\n\nI've never actually had to order replacement pieces before, so I don't know how or I'd give the instructions myself.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "So first thing about a meltdown is you can't really control it. You are incredibly sweet and understanding of your brother to not hold it against him. It might sound silly, but that actually means a lot to see someone doing that. You are a wonderful sister. \n\nIn the middle of a meltdown, he probably won't want to hear different ideas. Meltdowns aren't problem solving modes. He doesn't want it to be different, he wants it to be complete, he wants it to be perfect as it is. This is an incredibly strong drive and especially in the middle of a meltdown he won't hear it. I've literally thrown out entire dishes I've cooked before because I screwed up something dumb and was having a meltdown - I would rather throw it all out and do it right than have it wrong. \n\nInstead, I would suggest you do a lot of what you're doing already. Listen to him. If he is coming to you it is because he loves and trusts you and he is upset and sharing it with you. Autistics having meltdowns don't come to someone they don't trust. \n\nDuring this time, a lot of it is he just wants someone to listen to him and understand how upset he is. It doesn't have to be rational, it doesn't have to make sense. His special thing got messed up and it's incredibly upsetting and he is trying to process it. \n\nYou are already doing a good job here. \n\nNow, I would try to maybe suggest to him (not during a meltdown) that the throwing things is bad because he could break something (his own Legos even!!!) or hurt you. There is a definite physical energy that can come with a meltdown, so I get it, but he needs someone safe - I would suggest maybe seeing if he could get some pillows to punch or do something with or another outlet for the energy. \n\nDuring this time, you could even ask him upfront if there is anything you could do when he's upset to help. He might just tell you. Honestly, we aren't usually asked what helps, we're usually just told we're wrong for struggle with emotions. \n\nSome simple things to help with meltdowns:\n\n- listening (you already do this!)\n- give space and understanding (you already do this!)\n- tight hugs (squeeze the life out of us it's great)\n- something to make it a little less awful (not at the height of a meltdown, but when a little cooler, a favorite treat or activity can help)\n\nIn terms of his boat, could you offer to help him order replace pieces? He might not know how. Meltdowns are caused by something going wrong which leads to a feeling that everything is wrong and feeling helpless to do anything. It sucks. It's possible he doesn't know how or feels it's beyond him to fix. Helping him with this would mean a huge deal to him if he is struggling here. \n\nAll in all, you are honestly doing a great job and you are such a sweet and loving sister.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "Does anyone else make animal-like noises when upset?", "text": "I am low support needs autistic and am not someone who generally struggled to express myself verbally, but I do have this thing where as a sort of “instinctual” or automatic reaction if I’m particularly upset or in pain, I may make certain animal-like noises such as growling or softly whimpering like a dog. It feels more natural than talking and I don’t mean to do it, it just happens. I’ve become better at masking it but it occasionally slips out around my family, and my family do not appreciate it. This is on my mind because today I was already a bit upset and just sitting on the couch with a blanket (I like blankets, the weight is comforting) and my brother randomly walks up, starts pulling my blanket away (which I am using to comfort myself) and I automatically growl, to which a different family member scolds me for. It made me more upset honestly, it doesn’t seem fair that I’m the one who’s apparently in the wrong for growling when I was the one who was being provoked. This kind of thing happens whenever I make these sorts of noises around them, so I try to suppress it when possible and just do it when alone, but it doesn’t feel good to stop myself from doing it and instead speaking verbally to communicate basically the same information that could’ve been deduced from a growl or a whimper. My family says it’s “antisocial” and I guess I can kind of see where they’re coming from with that, but I don’t think they’d call a higher support needs autistic person antisocial for making verbal non-word noises like growls, I think they’d be understanding of that, so why is it bad for me to do it just because I am able to communicate through spoken language?

And like I said, oftentimes it just slips out before I’m able to suppress it and speak instead. \n\n\nAnyone else do this as a usually ‘verbal’ person? Do you let yourself do it, or do you try to suppress it?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "Adult autism help feels impossible. Burnt out, defeated, and honestly angry", "text": "I’m an adult trying to get help for what is very clearly autism/AuDHD, and I’m hitting wall after wall. I’m exhausted and honestly defeated.\n\nI’ve done the screenings. Multiple ones. Scores aren’t borderline, they’re very high. I’ve documented lifelong patterns, sensory overload, communication issues, rumination, masking, burnout, the whole picture. I’m not confused about what’s going on. I’m stuck on why it’s so hard to get anyone to help once you’re an adult.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that I also have kids who are very likely autistic. I’ve been fighting for them for years. Advocating, pushing, documenting, trying to make sure they don’t grow up dismissed the way I was. And here I am realizing I’m walking the same path now as an adult and getting the same response: waitlists, no coverage, “we don’t do adult autism,” or “treat the anxiety first.”\n\nI travel for work constantly, which means virtual care is not a preference, it’s a necessity. That alone seems to disqualify me from half the options that already barely exist. In-person only. State-restricted. Long waits. Or private assessments that cost thousands.\n\nAt this point, I’ve been using AI tools, videos, online resources, and other autistic adults’ experiences just to cope, understand myself, and survive the in-between. Honestly, AI has been more validating and helpful than most of the formal systems I’ve interacted with so far. That’s not something I expected to say.\n\nI’m in Michigan, and the state mental health system feels like a complete joke when it comes to autism, especially for adults. The “Michigan healthcare” and Priority Health routes lead nowhere for autism unless you’re a child or in crisis. I never fully realized how broken and inaccessible mental health care is until I actually needed it.\n\nInsurance doesn’t cover what I need. Private assessments are out of reach. Community mental health is months to years out if they even do adult autism at all. Telehealth options are either expensive or not diagnostic. I’m doing all the work myself and the system just shrugs.\n\nI’m not chasing a label for fun. I want understanding. I want support. I want my wife and my family to have something solid to lean on so this isn’t just “how I feel.” I want to be a better parent to my kids by actually understanding how our brains work.\n\nSo far I’ve reached out to:\n\t•\tCommunity mental health clinics\n\t•\tAutism Alliance of Michigan\n\t•\tSPARK for Autism\n\t•\tMultiple telehealth assessment providers\n\t•\tSliding scale and low-cost clinics\n\t•\tOnline screening programs and research registries\n\nAnd I’m still here. Waiting. Googling. Explaining myself over and over.\n\nI’m tired of being told “you’re functioning” as if that means I’m fine. I’m functioning because I’ve masked for decades and it’s burning me out.\n\nI guess I’m posting because I need to know:\n\t•\tHas anyone else gone through this as an adult?\n\t•\tHow did you survive the in-between when doctors and insurance weren’t helping?\n\t•\tAre there communities or paths that actually helped you feel less alone while waiting?\n\nI’m not giving up.

This isn't just a habit, I was always like this... at least as long as I can remember. It always feels like there are at least two semi-blended together people on the inside when I'm on my own and can actually feel what's going on in my mind instead if pulling myself together to appear as a person to other people. It's not two personalities, just two or more perspectives with different characteristics. My rational mind often argues with my feelings, for example. This inner dialogue often helps to figure out my needs better, too.\n\n\nAnd I've read a bit on it some time ago - not everyone has it this way, some people don't have an inner monologue at all, and for some it's a *monologue *, true to the way this phenomenon is called, they use *I* or a singular noun.  It doesn't depend on s neurotype afaik. For me it's literally an inner dialogue tho, I can't call it a monologue.\n\n\nThere's also a very flimsy hypothesis that people with a vanished twin might do this. I read a few articles about vanishing twin syndrome recently and found it curious that people who supposedly lost their twin within the first 3 months of their development show a lot of autistic traits like being oriented inwards, i.e. more introspective, alienated, and being HSP. (It was funny, I was reading the list and exclaimed \"That's literally just autism!\".) The issue is that it's incredibly hard to check if there was a twin on such an early pregnancy period, so I wouldn't give this idea too much credit. (Says the rational me, while the emotional me has already accepted it as our truth because honestly it would explain SO MUCH about my life. There, see?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I don't know you're full situation but I took the approach of advocating for myself by info dumping a ton of info in a family group chat over the course of 3 months until everyone who doubted it kinda came to the conclusion that yeah no I'm probably right, and they'd support me if I seeked a diagnosis. There was pushback, but every time they tried to discredit or deny something, I would show documented specific examples of behaviors I had when I was younger, and crossed it with comprehensive sited articles, videos, and other info that showed that these were traits of autism. \n\nThis approach might be a little much though if I'm being honest. My family just had a bunch of misconceptions/misinfo that caused them to believe \"there's no way, we would've known.\" \n\nI even had some of them realizing \"I thought everyone experienced that\" and made them self reflect to the idea that I'm probably not the only one who's neurodiverse. Since it is known to be hereditary. \n\nMy hopes were not only to be believed/supported, but also to avoid some of my siblings that have children who haven't entered primary school, from deciding not to seek  early diagnosis/interventions for my nieces. Since I don't want anyone in my family to have the possibility of experiencing the same traumatic upbringing I had in an allistic education environment with 0 accommodations and supports, which only lead to frequent burnout, meltdown, shutdown, and misdiagnosis leading me to take medications and having to unpack all this myself now as an adult. \n\nSorry for the long reply. Like I said I don't know your exact circumstances but I hope I could add some perspective that seeking diagnosis can not only feel validating for yourself, but it can have the cascading effect of allowing the people closest in your life around you to also take the steps in seeking answers for themselves.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768015805.0, "id": "nyq3uas", "author": "CopernicusKopo"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "You may feel this perspective is TOO OLD because I am 70 and didn't figure out I am autistic until my 60s. Even then it took a while for that reality to really settle in. What I can say it would have been a LOT BETTER to have figured it out at 18. Why? because there were a number of markers for my autism which caused problems for me throughout my life which now I realize I could have mediated if I have known I was autistic and how to address them. For example, I was impatient. I wanted fast results fast. In some situations that can even be a strength but in many skills (math, music, trades) that meant my achievements were weaker because I couldn't be patient and learn the intermediate steps that would lead to excellence later.\n\nThe hardest thing about autism for me is how I get blindsided by it. My autistic behaviors mostly happen fast and without my awareness. For example, I am very aware of inefficiencies - e.g. placement of things in the refrigerator can result in a flash of anger. In a corp work setting those triggers can be very challenging because inefficiencies are everywhere and they frustrate me and it can be difficult not to point them out. They seem so obvious to me and the feeling that they are wrong can be overwhelming. The problem with autism can be those feelings seem so clear and right it's hard to recognize they are just feelings and just my perspective - not necessarily true. They seem so true.\n\nThe road to a less frustrating life is to understand your autism and when those feelings cause you to react -to act out - without thinking. Over time you can get some separation from them and see them as just feelings. I call autism \"the dog that pulls\" because the feelings are strong and happen before you realize, but they often pull you into situations you don't like and the people around you certainly don't like.\n\nKnowing you're autistic is really important and helpful. Learning how that feels for you and learning to recognize those feelings as feelings and not demands for actions, while it can take a long time is huge.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768007015.0, "id": "nypdqu1", "author": "datasundae"}

I asked the psychologist about autism etc and mentioned autism a few times because some of my friends were autistic, and even tho I told her about my autistic friends she just kept on telling me that autistic people can't speak etc. Which ofc is true for a lot, but then there are a lot who can speak.\n\nAnd at 19/20 I was assessed for autism, my doctor suspected it based on symptoms, the new psychologist also thought it was autism, she wet through my old adhd assessments from when I was younger and said it all screamed autism and wondered why that hadn't been considered, she had me do some more tests in office specifically for autism and some to rule out other things, and then she also had an appointment with my mom, and then she discussed my case with specialists etc and they all agreed that I was 100% autistic.\n\nSo my first psychological testing was at 13, my first proper assessment for stuff was at 16 and my first autism specific assessment was at 19/20 (i turned 20 mid assessment).\n\nI would probably have gotten psychreatic testing in general when I was much younger than 13 if it wasn't for my mom wanting her kids to be normal.

He described which of my behaviors seemed liked ASD and it made me really curious what my doctor would say. She admitted she had wondered for years but never said anything. I got tested a year later. At the end they said it was pretty clear what the results would be. \n\nI’m not upset I have ASD. I think we are the best people. But, I’m furious that my doctors and therapists missed it for so long. Spending my entire life feeling like I don’t fit in, I’m weird, things feel more difficult for me. Idk.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "Question about texting autistic person on dating app", "text": "Hi! I have a question about texting with an autistic person. Sorry I'm not concise! I (F, ND but not autism) connected on a dating app with a guy who might be autistic (our common friend told me he might be, and I myself see many signs). We've chatted for just a week. He's been pretty responsive given it's such a short time.\n\nHe dometimes takes long hours to answer with just two words and that's the only thing he writes that day, sometimes writes a bit more. He also never asks questions about me and I feel like I'm doing all the labor to carry the conversation. I decided I'm okay with that for now as I understand it might be difficult for him and I want to support him in opening up on his own timeline. \n\nBut the thing that worries me is he never initiates any conversation and if I don't write, he doesn't either. I tried to go silent for two days now, I know it's a testing behaviour which I don't like, but I wanted to give him space and see if he initiates in his own rhytm, and he doesn't write at all. The thing is I also have a great deal of social anxiety and insecurity about texting, and I feel like I'm bothering and chasing and needy if it's always me who texts first. \n\nI would like to gently address this with him to know whether this is just his style (prefers to respond rather than initiate), or whether it's a sign he's not that excited about sustaining the connection. I would love the clarity. I hurt myself in past relationships where I was the only one sustaining the connection, which made me feel needy and anxious. I think I'm fine doing that if I know it's just his style and he still appreciates me always texting first, but I wouldn't like to continue if he's in fact just not that excited, as I don't want to be chasing.\n\nMy Q: What would be a way to address it over text that wouldn't scare you or make you feel guilty? Would something like this be too much? \"Hi, do you still want to text? I noticed that if I don't iniciate, you don't write either. Do you maybe want to text less often?\"\n\nI really like him and don't want to blow this up. I don't want to make him feel judged, I want to support him so he knows I really like when we text.\n\nSome context: when I noticed he never asks questions, and I asked Is there something you'd like to know about me?, he answered Everything. When I asked if he wanted to meet in person later, he said yes. He also described himself as not assertive. I already told him I really like when he texts, and that he might write sth about himself or his interests, which he does with some depth (but only the one time I ask him to).\n\nThank you so much to everyone who reads this.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768058377.0, "id": "1q96odg", "author": "Intelligent-Law-6800", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q96odg/question_about_texting_autistic_person_on_dating/"}

I also have a congenital heart defect which is on my health record. \n\nI went to the doctors three times to ask for help but because I was plus size when the ED got really bad I wasn’t taken seriously.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I have had real life injuries and drs still tried to tell me it was in my head. Forget trying to go to them about anything that I have that isn’t even visible when I was booted out of a hospital and gaslit and given medical ptsd when I had a full thickness third degree burn after a house fire. \n\n“We will call you a taxi and pay for it just find somewhere to stay” while I was in a wheelchair and unable to walk after a near amputation and skin graft. (I kept my toe) but they needed to do a surgery and when my main surgeon left unexpectedly I had this mean woman come in and try to tell me I had to leave. \n\n“But I just lost my house and my 8.5 year relationship broke down, I have nowhere to LIVE” \n\n“It’s not OUR problem, a lot of people in fires lose their house. You should’ve had insurance. your foot will get the physio/care and treatment as an outpatient”. \n\nI managed to get the extra day or two after 2 or 3 trauma and what can now be seen as autistic meltdowns, but when I was kicked out, in my wheelchair, with my open wound.. do you think I had the continuity of care as the outpatient. ? \n\nI think I had the same friendly nurses as inpatient for 3-4 visits. No physio as promised (I had to learn to walk again, my foot was charred). And go to the hospital for 2-3 times a week dressing changes. \n\n2 weeks after my outpatient taxi call that left me with my grandma for a time. I was then gaslit by the worst most malicious and unkind nurse I’ve ever experienced in my life. She tried to use soap and betadine on the burn, and I was told specifically by my surgeon not to use betadine. Then she tried to use tap water and put one of those blue booties from the hospital on it with no protective bandage. Then I was begging for antiseptics, wound care.. something. \n\nThey wrote me AN OPIATE SCRIPT. I said I want the dressings and physio as promised, and the proceeded to call me “hysterical” “overdramatic” and “ridiculous” for requesting basic wound care for a 3rd degree open wound on my actual foot when I couldn’t actually walk. \n\nI was stunned as someone with existing CPTSD &amp; ADHD who has dealt with issues within mental health and being gaslit by invisible psychosocial issues. But for an open wound? That created a spiral. \n\nSure enough. I went all out. I complained. They blocked my IP address. I was forced to see my GP, who took care of it until it wasn’t getting better and then a wound clinic. Who were great until I had to deal with a similar uncaring nurse archetype and she went through the run of the mill gaslighting routine I’m so familiar with. \n\nAs someone who was recently diagnosed I was reading it’s a thing to avoid healthcare. \nI’m wondering if it’s not so much about ignoring internal cues but because of not feeling like we can be believed or understood in a system that is so aysymetrical and overwhelming to deal with it just sometimes feels pointless unless like in the case I ended up in the hospital was because I was unconscious in my front yard after my fire and the fire brigade called ambulance and police. The ambulance was forcing me to go to the hospital initially. Which was something I was against doing even though I was literally on fire, and nearly died. I saved my birds luckily. But I didn’t even want to go. They sedated me to get me to the ambulance. \n\nWhen things come up. I have an issue with RCPD, i haven’t dealt with. I have a hole in my septum, I have had issues with my sinus and ear and went to somewhere deaf people go because doctors don’t listen. \nI would probably be dying of something and never realise because it’s better for me to not waste my time trying to prove something to people who don’t listen. I’ve learnt where my energy is best spent. I have enough issues to realise that these people don’t care about me, or cptsd or neurodivergence. They really don’t understand it. Don’t care or claim to. We need our own systems and people who work within them that can understand us. \n\nJust know you aren’t alone. \n\nSometimes people who can advocate for you is the way to avoid medical gaslighting so that’s the only thing I can advise if you are lucky enough to have that. \n\nMaybe a doctor who is “open” to treating what you have, or understanding that specific issue would also help. I tend to look for that as I have PMDD. But that’s also not taken seriously when it’s a neuroendocrine inflammatory stress response. \nFor those with Drs who don’t listen or believe you: medical gaslighting;\n\nAll I can advise it what is lived and learnt \n\n\nBecome your own advocate and expert. Do as much research and find what specific treatment you need and bring the notes of how it has impacted you and for how long. The paper work trail tends to be the one thing they can’t avoid. It’s evidence. From that point they can’t avoid your advocacy and necessity for treatment. Your diligence for documenting the symptoms and how it impacts you shows agency, necessity and longitudinal impact. \n\nIf needed, do it until you find someone who can help. I understand it’s not so easy as the system collapses when the weight is so heavy. But prepare first and then you can maybe feel that you are coming to someone who is knowledgeable (read the reviews), and seek their guidance after doing your own research. \n \n\nI hope this makes sense. It’s a nightmare for all of us with comorbid diagnosis. \n\nI find I get the best treatment if I say I have NOTHING at all. \n\nPeople change their attitude when they find out your diagnostic history which is the opposite of how it should be especially as most people with autism can be overly honest and authentic. \n\nOptimally, in my own advocacy I found my own treatments and solutions outside of the mainstream healthcare and that took away the issue of dealing with them. I have a piece of glass in my foot right now from a fe days ago which means I need to see a dr before it gets infected as it’s in my burn and it’s opened up a healed wound. So I have to deal with them and I swear if they try to tell me there isn’t glass, I don’t know how I’ll cope. It’s one of those big medical centers so if necessary I might have to see every practitioner in the center to look at the toe as I broke a candle holder, I had to vaccum glass, I stepped on the glass, felt the crunch, was overwhelmed with cleaning and organising so it wasn’t immediate. the healed wound became a bloody wound when I looked at it before bed. Now it’s crusty and opened and inflamed and has glass splinters coming out with the baking soda I used on it. But it’s too deep to pull out with burn scar tissue. \n\nSo I am about to go tomorrow and I’m nervous about them even trying to look at it, let alone believe me even though the foot injury is obvious. It’s what patterns we see after medical gaslighting and it can cause medical ptsd if you have a terrible experience that really messes you up.\n\n\nI hope everyone can find a solution. It sometimes reading about this feels the system is the issue and not the neurodivergent or person, who has been traumatised by the system is the issue.

I want some advice because theres gotta be someone who relates.", "text": "I (22F) have high functioning autism and CPTSD (due to a long and complicated past.) My fiancé (23M) has always been incredibly supportive especially of my ambition to change how people like me are viewed and treated.\n\nRecently, my MIL (45F) moved in with us, and it has been extremely stressful. My fiancé’s work has been delayed due to the winter season, so for the past two months I’ve been the sole income earner. The house we live in is owned by my fiancé’s grandfather (82), and we take care of the property to the best of our abilities (there’s more to that situation, but it’s not relevant here).\n\nMy MIL does not “believe” I’m autistic because I “don’t look autistic”... something most people with HFA have heard before. Since she moved in, my entire routine has been thrown off. I started with a new security company, I’m in the process of starting my own business, and my routines (which I rely on heavily) are constantly being disrupted.\n\nFinancial stress has been overwhelming. I’ve had weeks of sleepless nights dealing with things like:\nSleeping in my car near work\nPower getting shut off\nFood insecurity\n\nI finally got the power back on and restocked food, only to come home to a complete mess—dishes piled up, puppies using the house as a bathroom, chaos everywhere. I was already overstimulated and exhausted.\n\nMy fiancé helped calm me down and set me up with some much-needed downtime on my favorite game (Minecraft) basic dont hate me. Then my MIL walked in and said she wanted to talk about finances my biggest fucking stressor.\n\nMy fiancé stepped in and told her that since I’m the only one working right now, I needed space and that we could talk about it the next day. She refused, demanding answers, schedules, financial details, and that I take on more household responsibilities. I shut down and went to bed.\n\nMy fiancé later confronted her and told her she was being inconsiderate, and that if she wanted things done her way, she could get a job herself.\n\nThe next morning, while getting ready for work, I noticed my new refrigerator (a birthday gift) sitting outside in the rain with the doors open. It is temporarily outside, but there are internal components that can be damaged.\nWhen I mentioned it, my MIL admitted it was her fault and apologized—but then followed it up with, “Well my washer is exposed to the elements too.” This caused another argument.\n\nFor context: her washer was repaired twice, then officially deemed unfixable. I replaced it with a new insured smart washer (currently waiting on a technician). We’ve explained this situation multiple times. Yet she insists hoarding it.\n\nI ended the argument by saying:\n“I don’t expect you to understand it, but I have a job that keeps you guys fed, so I’m leaving.”\n\nAt this point, I’m starting to see her as a constant source of stress and conflict in my life. I feel like she’s a problem I don’t have the tools to solve.\nI can't confront her directly and feel bad letting my fiancé handle mediation between us.", "score": 0, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768080567.0, "id": "1q9g9tq", "author": "Human-Shop-4418", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q9g9tq/i_feel_like_i_hate_my_mil_because_she_has_a_you/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "It's ... interesting. Very inconsistent across domains and contexts. But my memory of *places* is like, and don't take this to mean the way people usually mean it I know better than that, is like photographic. Like I can take many places I've been and completely navigate them like a 3D model in my head. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to affect navigation abilities much. It's more so being able to see and visualize objects and spaces in this way. Afaik while memory is related to these visualization capabilities there are differences. Generally the focus in this context is on *imagined* visualizations rather than actual memories but for me they can kind of blend together anyway (without any impact on separation of fact; I know what I'm imagining and what is strictly real). That said memories are always reconstructions and errors can slip in for everyone. If I am remembering my readings correctly, there are specific memory deficits associated with aphantasia but I don't think there is as much research into how hyperphantasia impacts memory. For me it is not just sight but also other senses that can be integrated into my mentalizations with differing levels of ease and intentional focus required as well as success. Besides visual, I find motion, space, and tactile generally easiest to visualize but tactile has a high ceiling since it involves *more* information that I have to consciously focus on. Think of it like body scanning but a pretend version inside of your head and that's basically what this stuff is like to me. However, my memory of events and people and exact temporal information has improved with age but has always been strange. I like had and sometimes still have like frequent deja vu experiences and stuff like that. I'm not sure what to think of it. Memory depends a lot on concentration and environment. Also when it comes to activities my interaction with a lot of them tends not to be very visual if that makes sense. Usually it is more functional and computational (I have also this thing where decisions and quantitative stuff is often tied to feelings of movement and figure and such and also sounds are mostly vaguely associated with shapes and motion to me, but I also tend to automatically have this sense of seeing the space that the sound exists in too, like a geometry of sound and motion that ties into quantitative processing and reasoning).

My wife puts the 4\" tall cottage cheese carton in the section of the fridge meant for taller cartons like milk. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TwBSgKwivw.   \nIt's not like I as struck by the thought 'You know it seems like it would be better to put tall things here' it's an immediate flash of emotion. I might explain that to myself afterwards, but, why? It's so obviously \"stupid\" there's nothing to explain.  \nIf I have the good sense to contain my displeasure in my own head that whole episode concludes in less than 5 minutes -on to the next travesty. But if my wife's nearby I might express my exasperation to her. Now I don't know about your wives, but my wife doesn't appreciate having her intelligence called into question over milk carton placement. Her displeasure doesn't conclude in 5 minutes - think 5 hours. About 2 hours into those stretches of marital bliss I somethings think \"maybe milk carton placement isn't as important as I thought\". In fact, if you think about it, what's the worst case scenario here? I have a milk carton to place in the fridge and, dare I say it, I must move the cottage cheese to make room. The horror.   \nThis seemingly obvious conclusion took me literally decades to learn (slow study). I used to think autism was a more logical disjuncture -I think about things differently. What I have some to realize is in my case it's much more emotional. I am struck by feelings. The lights are SO bright - they actually burn - I feel it. The TV's too loud - it hurts. For me that's very real but it's not thoughts I am having, it's emotions I am having and they can make me angry. A problem with autism is those feelings combined with an overwhelming conviction that my reaction is \"RIGHT\" the cottage cheese REALLY IS misplaced, lead me to acting out my feelings. The problem with that is by any standards of human companionship, that's not fun to be around.   \nThe lesson for me was although my feelings are real, my emotional perspective is just that - my emotional perspective. It's not \"right\" and it's certainly not an excuse to make the people around me uncomfortable or worse.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768056693.0, "id": "1q95zmz", "author": "datasundae", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q95zmz/the_milk_and_the_cottage_cheese_carton/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I am so so sorry. I was in high school the last few years of the 90s, when all the cute pants were low rise. I have a vivid memory from junior year of wearing my favorite glittery jeans and bending over to get something out of the file drawer I got to use as a locker in the drama room. I heard a commotion behind me and realized that a Senior girl was making the most horrified grossed out look at me, a pointing out my granny panties hanging out the back of my jeans.\n\nI appreciate that other students were shushing her and telling her to stop saying, “she’s nice, she’s so nice, leave her alone.” But I can still her disgusted face so clearly. It wasn’t even that my panties or butt were hanging out, because that was the style at the time. It was that they were granny panties and not a thong. I just wore what I thought was comfortable and cute, and had no idea how it looked when I bent over. But I became hyper aware about it the rest of my life. And still, no one who was there told me that they could see my granny panties.\n\nI can’t change that it happened. But I did let it change a couple things for the future (besides the hypervigilance of my pant waistline).\n\n1. I decided to be a person who tries to find things like that with myself funny instead of embarrassing. While I might still feel a flash of embarrassment, choosing to point it out myself and laugh about it honestly saved me a lot of stress and gave me a more positive outlook. And it really served me well down the road with things that so many people get so embarrassed about. I could say and feel “it is what it is” and not be anxious about it.\n\n2. I also decided to be the person who tells people things they might not know about and wish people told them. Not in a critical way or pointing out every little thing, just making sure they’re aware of their fly being open or lipstick on their teeth or toilet paper on their shoe. I also try to make sure I convey that it’s not a big deal. With my daughter I have said things like “did you know that you have some mascara on your eyelid? It’s not a big deal but I can show you how to remove it easily if you want me to.” And if she doesn’t care, I don’t care. \n\nWhen it comes to exposing body parts, I will whisper it discreetly to people. Like “No shame here at all, but with how loose your shirt is I can see all the way down to your belly button when you bed over, and I just wanted to make sure you were aware in case it’s something that you would want to know.” Again, if they don’t care, I don’t care, unless it’s a weird situation involving intimidation/harassment of employees by a superior which I have dealt with in the past.

One thing I'm sure you've learned at your age, college students are still very immature. They messed up, they were wrong, but you can, at your age, forgive the younger versions of them. That is probably something you'll need some time to work toward.\n\nRemember also that yours is really the first generation that has this \"infinite\" memory of childhood/young adult misdeeds. These things have happened for hundreds, probably thousands of years, but now instead of stopping at a hushed conversation after lecture hall, a lot of it just stays online forever. You're in good company among generations of college students.\n\nIf/when you are ready to, you could choose to own it. It doesn't have to be a pure negative thing. \"Plumber's crack\" is an old stereotype that younger people assume is purely negative. As I've gotten older, I've met a surprising number of people (both women, and men) who do not view it very negatively. Once you're ready to own it, \"You're welcome\" is an easy response any time someone brings it up.\n\nAnd you can distance. If you don't want to own it, or if that becomes tiresome at some point, you can just say \"Ah. I'm past all that.\" Of course you'll need to process to get to that point, but it's something that's reachable. \n\nThis feels bigger than it truly is. That feeling is valid and you need to process it. But known this is a minor thing that happened 10 years ago. Unless you build this up, by the time you are 45, this will be silly, you will be completely past it, so my suggestion is to be gentle and forgiving with yourself (your current self and your past self) while you process it now.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "How should I write a story that's metaphorically about autism without being disrespectful?", "text": "I think it's probably important to clarify that I'm autistic myself\n\nLately I've been thinking that it would be interesting to try writing a story that's about the experience of having autism. The premise behind it is that it's about a bunch of aliens from different planets attempting to come together, but having difficulty due to having entirely different customs, behaviors, and needs. I imagine that each major character would be on a different part of the spectrum, so to speak. Though technically speaking they're more autistic coded \n\nFirst off, is this premise offensive? I know the autistic aliens trope is often seen as pretty bad representation, so I'm worried about that. Would it be weird to have it be about different \"autistic people\" having trouble with each other, instead of with neurotypical people? Is this the sort of premise that would just be better as one about actual human people, rather than this sort of metaphorical approach?\n\nI want it to be about aliens mostly because I just personally think it's more whimsical and fun, in all honesty. It's not for any advertiser reasons or anything, I just think it would be cute and relatable. I honestly also don't want it to be *super* overt, if that makes sense? I want it to be a clear theme, but I also want the story to have its own identity outside of that theme, if that makes sense? It's hard to explain \n\nIf this sort of premise is acceptable, what are some things I can do to make it respectful? What stereotypes should I avoid? Where are some good sources I could use for research? How different can the experience of having autism be for different people on the spectrum? What accommodations do people need for different issues?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "The more depressing answer is probably that I am just plain lucky to have several people in my life who have never given up on me, which I know is not true for everyone.\n\nBut personally, what ultimately keeps me going when I feel like I'm just in everyone else's way is Christianity, despite all of its issues. I sometimes refer to myself as a \"Christian Nihilist,\" by which I mean that Nihilism would be the only alternative to Theism in my mind, and given that I think Christianity actually is true, nothing matters *except* God and his will and works. And since Christianity is the Theistic worldview I think is true, God's will includes the wellbeing of his entire creation, first and foremost every individual human. (When asked what is the single greatest commandment, Jesus replied with what sounds like two separate commandments — love God… *and* love your neighbor…) \n\nAnd it's not like God just expected us to be \"smiling happy people\" and pretend nothing bad ever happens to anyone who follows him — that's just what neurotypical people want to believe and so they sweep under the rug all the parts of the Bible that deal with real grief, anger at God, confusion, and depression. Ecclesiastes is *by far* my favorite book of the Old Testament, if not the whole Bible. It shows us that questions of purpose and the Problem of Evil are nothing new, and nothing to shy away from. A huge proportion of the Psalms are lamenting and/or \"imprecatory,\" — wishing harm on someone. If the Bible is actually inspired by God, then God wanted us to cry out to him, \"What is wrong with you?? Why are you letting those people get rich by exploiting the poor and vulnerable??

I hope that everyone is doing great!\n\nFor the past couple of days, communication hasn’t been going very well. He barely talks to me; usually he replies when I’m already going to sleep or something like that. We had already talked about trying to have small moments of communication during the day when we’re busy, but that hasn’t really been working. Sometimes many hours go by without him answering, even though I know he does reply to other people because he’s told me he’s been on calls with friends (he usually is a slow replier to everyone). It doesn’t bother me if he takes a while, but it does bother me when more than eight hours go by without even letting me know, for example, that he’s going to be busy that day, because that’s when I start to worry. Even a short check-in message (or something silly) would make a difference.\n\nYesterday I was already pretty upset and waited until the evening to talk about it, but before I could say anything, he told me he was going on a call with friends. At that moment I told him I wanted to talk about this because it was affecting me and I wanted us to find some common ground. We agreed to talk this morning, since he was also seeing friends today, and he asked me to write more or less what I was feeling in the meantime.\n\nI did exactly that and waited all morning. He only showed up to say that he had finished with the preparations an hour before his friends arrived. I tried to bring the topic up again, but he didn’t even open the message even though he was online, and now I know he won’t reply because he’s already with them. It’s been three days that I’ve been in a bad mood because of this; he knows it, but he doesn’t seem to want to talk about it.\n\nI wouldn’t mind if he told me he feels blocked, that communication is hard for him, or anything that could help us improve the situation. But he tells me absolutely nothing, and that’s really affecting me. We’ve only just started seeing each other and, honestly, I don’t know if this is something that’s going to keep happening, if he’ll ever give me an explanation, or what to expect from all this. I’m someone who really prioritizes communication and both of us feeling comfortable, but I don’t know what to do because this is affecting me and I’m not getting any feedback either.\n\nThank you in advance and have a good day!", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768071614.0, "id": "1q9cdf5", "author": "Careless-Hall-415", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q9cdf5/my_partner_is_autistic_and_i_would_like_to_know/"}

I am currently writing my Bachelor’s thesis on the topic “**Negative Experiences with Verbal Communication with Persons in Professional Positions of Power.”** For this purpose, I am seeking **experience reports** to develop quality criteria and preventive measures\\*\\*. The deadline is February 28th, 2026.\n\nI am seeking reports about **any communication (spoken or written) from persons in a professional position that was perceived negatively**. **Professional positions of power include, for example, uniformed, medical, psychiatric, therapeutic, care-related, social, educational, and teaching professions, as perceived by the affected person.** Every contribution is valid, even if the situation seems brief, \"insignificant,\" or happened a long time ago, including during childhood or adolescence. You can participate from anywhere in the world, and it does not matter where you had that experience. Reports can be in German or English.\n\n***If possible, the reports should mention or be accompanied by information on:***\n\n\\- **Who said or wrote what in which context? Which remark was perceived as negative?** **If applicable, for what reason.** **If applicable, which response would have been preferred instead.**\n\n**- Profession or role of the person**\n\n**- Number and duration of situation(s)**\n\n**- Setting**\n\n**- Number of people involved**\n\nHere are examples of wording and relevant information that can be used as guidance but do not have to be followed:\n\n*-* ***Who said or wrote what in which context?*** ***Which remark was perceived as negative?*** ***If applicable, for what reason.*** ***If applicable, which response would have been preferred instead.***\n\n*(e.g., “I said …, and X responded …. What hurt me was that the person said …, because …, and I would have wished for them to say … instead.”)*\n\n***- Profession or role of the person***\n\n*(e.g., psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist, doctor, police officer, firefighter, emergency responder / paramedic, educator, teacher, social worker, (key) support worker, counselor, coach, mentor, trainer, instructor, case worker, case manager, (ward / nursing) staff, management, supervisor, officer)*\n\n***- Number and duration of situation(s)***\n\n*(e.g., “I saw this person for five sessions of one hour each over a period of five months. Already in one of the first appointments, … was said, and in the final session … was said as well.”)*\n\n***- Setting***\n\n*(e.g., home, outpatient, semi-residential, or inpatient)*\n\n***- Number of people involved***\n\n*(e.g., “In a meeting with the entire team of ten people, my supervisor said …” /*  \n*“There were a total of four police officers present; two questioned me and two questioned the other party, and one of the officers who questioned me said …”)*\n\nLength and detail are flexible, e.g., whether thoughts, feelings, needs, reasoning, interpretations, etc., are included. The focus is on the personal perspective in one’s own words, so no specific wording is required. Existing texts (posts, comments, reviews, complaints) can also be submitted. A person is also permitted to submit several reports. You must be at least 18 years old.\n\n**Please send reports via email to** [**nadine.ubachs@evh-bochum.de**](mailto:nadine.ubachs@evh-bochum.de)**.** After emailing me (report or expression of interest), you will receive a random code for pseudonymization and an informed consent form. You must confirm this form for your report to be used. You maintain control over your data at all times.\n\n Initial contact for questions or to review the informed consent and data protection information in order to support the decision about participation is also possible here.\n\nThe content of the reports will be anonymized by me. Anonymization and deletion of personally identifiable information may also be carried out in advance if you feel more comfortable doing so.\n\nI am looking for participants between January 1st, 2026 and February 28th, 2026. Being over 18 at the time of partivipation is the only criterion. Since reports can vary in length and you may submit either new or previously written content, the time needed for participation may vary. The research is not exclusively about autism, but people with autism often have a lot of contact with healthcare workers, such as therapists and psychiatrists, and may have individual needs that have to be considered when communicating with them. Those needs not being met is an example of the kind of experience I am looking for.\n\nQuestions are always welcome.\n\n \n\nThank you for reading. I look forward to your contributions.\n\nNadine Ubachs", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768049882.0, "id": "1q93f12", "author": "LetsCherishLife96", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q93f12/seeking_reports_on_negative_experiences_with/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "From personal experience, stopping stimming is borderline impossible. Not because it is hard to stop, but as your experience echoes, it comes at a very high cost.\n\n\nFirst, evaluate if you really need to stop fully. \n\n\nThe one thing that worked for me is replacing stims with other stims, and only if I need to do it to survive (like in a work environment, or somewhere im being ostracized a lot for the behavior, like highschool or uni).\n\n\nTry to consider what other behaviors you have that could be stims, or if u could modify the pacing to make it more publicly acceptable in the scenario you need it to be. Im also a pacer, and working from home. I usually get 7-8k steps just at home. I've learned to substitute pacing in public (office, police station etc) with tapping my foot, tapping rhythms on a table or on my body with my hands, if im very stressed I usually default to nail picking or biting. Im 30yo now, its not perfect and it takes gentleness with yourself and curiosity to try and play around with new potential stims.\n\n\nAnother consideration is an activity that maybe calms u and is more socially acceptable, like writing, reading, etc.\n\n\nA few things that really helps me if I do them first thing in the day, I need to stim a lot less:\n- High intensity cardio, even just a 1m sprint can calm my pacing for a few hours\n- Daily meditation practice, 5mins a couple of times a day. Im not consistent here, but the periods in my life when I am I ended up with near-zero need for stimming. Not saying it'll work for everyone but very much worth a try.\n- Cold shock shower, 30 seconds of coldest water\n- Ice cold water in a bowl, and submerge your face in it for 30s (divers reflex)\n- Breath work: Box breathings, breath-holding a few times for 7-8 seconds and exhaling from my mouth. \n\n\nI have several harmful stims that show up only in periods of burnout or high stress, when I focus less on stopping them and more on taking better care of myself, they organically become less problematic.\n\n\nBest of luck", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768044252.0, "id": "nyrqeoc", "author": "Known_Reading8510"}

Which made sense together.\n\nNow for Christmas, my mom gave me an expensive watercolor palette and cheap new brushes.\n\nPaper is the most important supply in watercolor. So, I feel like I have to buy expensive paper to make it work with the expensive paint.\n\nNow the problem is that the paint is expensive, but not good. My mom got it at a craft supply store where they advised this palette, but online I can find it cheaply on other websites. There are no places/reviews who advise this palette and the only place I can find it sold is at a toy store. So, my conclusion is that it's not as good as the price makes it seem.\n\nSo what do I do now? Do I use cheap paper and brushes with an expensive (but not very good) palette? That feels wrong since the paper is cheap but the palette expensive. I feel like things should line up, especially since paper is most important.\n\nOr do I use expensive paper with the expensive palette, but the palette is not good, so it doesn't make sense to waste expensive paper with bad paint?\n\nI can't get over this and since I got the present I haven't been painting. It feels wrong. I cannot just throw the palette away since it was a gift and I live with my mom. I can't solve this by logic.\n\n\n\n|Situation|1: Paper (most important)|2: Paint|3: Brushes (least important)|Outcome|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Before|Cheap / Bad|Cheap / Bad|Cheap / Bad|✅|\n|After|**Cheap** / Bad|**Expensive** / Bad|Cheap / Bad|❌|\n|Solution?|Expensive / **Good**|Expensive / **Bad**|Cheap / Bad|❌|\n\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768054313.0, "id": "1q951s3", "author": "Bright-Ad5337", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q951s3/how_do_i_solve_this_issue_things_arent_lining_up/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "Lack of sleep is the worst thing. It's no wonder it's used as a form of torture.\n\nJust some suggestions:\n\n1) get good quality earplugs that fit well e.g. Macks.\n\n2) get some good quality drugs to help with sleep. Trazadone and Xanax are good but have to be used carefully, and they may not work for you. You have to be prepared to try multiple things. Melatonin didn't help me either, it made me fall asleep but wake up a few hours later. There is a slow release one which might be better.\n\n3) see what you can do about physically insulating yourself. Can you rearrange the room a bit to move your bed away and/or put furniture in the way\n\n4) fix your diet: no caffeine, don't eat too late, quit sugary snacks etc. This all interacts with your sleep.\n\n5) improve general sleep hygiene - this is overrated for many of us (and trivializes the serious issue we have) but worth try alongside other methods.\n\n6) don't keep pushing for absolute silence. Sometimes that can be counter productive and it makes you more sensitive over time. Maybe get a white noise machine or some other less annoying background noise to help drown it out.\n\n7) tell your family the problems you are having. Most people assume sleep is a minor problem - they don't understand how it can be cripplingly disabling. They can help by not waking you up when not required (e.g. school is required, a weekend sleep in fan be good for you)\n\n8) prioritize TOTAL sleep. People will tell you not to nap but that's ridiculous when things get really bad. You'd SHOULD nap to try to keep total hours around 7-8 per day minimum, but don't nap for long periods, only max one hour at a time outside normal hours and not in the evening.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768033216.0, "id": "nyr6i57", "author": "xWhatAJoke"}

Since I’ve never posted anything this open and honest online before, I would appreciate any help or advice, and I believe anyone replying will have valuable insight.\n\nI’m a third-year **Graphic Design / Art &amp; Design** student in the UK. I’ve passed years 1 and 2 with decent grades, but since around September–October, I’ve been recovering from a **severe mental health crisis and shutdown**. I’m autistic, and while things are slowly improving, my capacity still isn’t anywhere near where it needs to be.\n\nBecause of this, my attendance in term 1 was very low (around 30% for classes, even lower for dissertation meetings). The university is aware of my situation and has been supportive, and I now need to decide what to do before the start of term 2.\n\n\n\n**My main options are:**\n\n\n\n**1. Defer my third year and return in September 2026**\n\nThis time would give me proper time to recover, stabilise my mental health, work a bit, and come back able actually to do my best work. The downside is financial pressure during the gap and graduating a year later than planned.\n\n\n\n**2. Apply for an extension / NEC**\n\nThis NEC would extend my deadlines by 3–4 months, if granted, so I’d finish later this year. Financially, this is easier, but it would mean working through the summer while still recovering, and there’s a real risk I burn out again. If I choose this, I can’t switch to a deferral later.\n\n\n\n**3. Continue with no adjustments**\n\nThis option keeps me on track time-wise, but realistically, it means pushing through heavy coursework and a dissertation while my mental health is still fragile. This feels like the highest-risk option.\n\n**My concern:**\n\nI don’t want to quit university — I’m very close to finishing — but I’m scared of making a decision that harms my long-term mental health or results in poor work after already investing so much time and money.\n\nI keep going back and forth between “take the time and do it properly” and “just push through and get it over with.” If you’ve deferred a final year, taken an extension, or pushed through under similar circumstances, what would you wish you’d known beforehand?", "score": 1, "num_comments": 4, "created_utc": 1768063397.0, "id": "1q98tal", "author": "TDCclothing", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q98tal/final_year_uni_student_deferral_vs_extension_vs/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "My true friendships didn’t come until late high school. And even now I’ve lost friends even other autistic ones just because differences in personality and trauma etc. \n\nBut you WILL find your people. Right now you are limited to school and what parents take you to or allow. Once you are older and gain more freedom you can find your tribe of people your little group. But do the work now to understand yourself and protect yourself (build strong boundaries etc) so you can be safe once your out there because from my own experience dealing with people is still tough but my genuine relationships have made that worth it. But those didn’t happen until late high school and the other at 26/27 years old. \n\nA lot of other great advice was shared here so I won’t re-say  the same thing to ya. There are people who wish they had the dx to better help themselves and people who didn’t. I feel the label only helps us know how to help ourselves and work on parts of ourselves we would like to help/“improve.” \n\nThere are plenty of jobs you don’t need to mask or the mask is literally just a smile and rehearsed responses. When I was a cashier I just had rehearsed responses to common things. (I tended to study movies and television so I picked up on this easier than others.) How are you? “Oh living the dream” or “I’m okay how about you?” Usually works. Nasty weather out there! “Yeah it’s raining hard!” Or “yeah be safe!” But there are stocking positions as well. And when I was younger there was no way I could’ve said those scripts I used as an example even but I’ve worked on it a bit as I’ve gotten older just naturally but also purposefully. \n\nRarely did customers wanna talk more than that unless they were really old and I was helping them with the photo area (I was good at this and patient so was called to do it a lot instead of others lol.) \n\nI give you these examples to show that even though it feels impossible now, you can develop coping strategies and ways of doing things to help you with some of this stuff. The important part now as a younger person is to figure YOU out. What makes things unbearable for you? Certain sounds? Certain lights? What can you still tolerate for half the shift maybe? Or could you use ear plugs etc. There are lots of ways to accommodate a problem usually. But it’s your job right now to learn yourself so you know what may work for you. Does that make sense? I’d focus my energy there personally as action or taking action usually helps mitigate anxiety a lot of times. \n\nAlso gently hun, the more you force yourself for normalcy the more you will end up feeling like it’s the end of your world. We can’t shame or force ourselves to be neurotypical or for certain things to work for us. But we CAN work WITH ourselves. We just have to accept ourselves first. Radical acceptance is not about changing feelings. It SUCKS that I struggle to regulate myself emotionally sometimes. I accept this is part of myself but I don’t have to necessarily like it. I can still dislike it but accept it’s there and needs dealt with. There’s no shame in that. \n\nI hope you have a good support system at home that allows you to express yourself authentically unmasked and can develop an additional support system if you don’t already have it with a neurodivergent therapist. My therapist has helped me so much to not get caught in black and white thinking and to even understand the process for doing things, for example I am now back in college thanks to my therapists direct help filling everything out / making sure I understood certain things. \n\nI’m sorry for your experiencing and the pain you’re experiencing right now. I want to validate it and say even though for example others wish they had the dx younger etc or may not quite understand that doesn’t change the pain you feel right now. I do believe with time things will get better for you. Every one of us is human right now for the first time, it’s their first time living just like yours. Theres a lot to figure out! They are a bunch of confused 8th graders too learning about themselves. I don’t feel I changed much over the years I’ve always kinda just been me, but for neurotypical people and other people they often change multiple times through life. And keep changing. Even though I don’t feel I have, I have in small ways, we all do. Things will change with time. I think if you focus on your needs right now and authenticity, your people will be drawn to you and seek you out just as much as you seek them. 🫂🥰\n\nI rambled a bit here but hope my point was clear, if not please let me know so I can reclarify!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "Raising 3 autistic kids - would this help anyone?", "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to get some honest opinions from this community.\n\nI’m one of four siblings, and three of my siblings are autistic. I’m the only one who isn’t. My brother was born first and is couple years younger than me. Then, ten years later, my parents had my sister, and a couple of years after that another sister was born. Both of them are autistic as well. So there were big gaps, and very different stages of life overlapping.\n\nGrowing up, I watched my parents navigate raising autistic kids at very different ages, all with different needs and challenges. When my sisters were little, things could be especially hard. There was a lot of screaming and crying which is common for small children but my brother really struggled to tolerate it, which often escalated things even more. That period was probably the most difficult one for our family and required a huge amount of adjustment from everyone, especially my mom.\n\nMy dad pushed his feelings down and avoid dealing with them directly. He doesn’t really talk about them or work on them, he just holds it all in.\n\nMy mom, on the other hand, has done a lot of inner work over the years. She’s accepted the situation for what it is and has grown incredibly strong mentally because of it. Over the years, I’ve watched her change, reflect on herself, and keep going even when things were extremely hard. It hasn’t been easy, not even close, but she never gave up. She managed to create her own happiness and is peace with the situation. \n\nShe loves reading, and lately I’ve been encouraging her to think about writing a book herself. Not a how-to guide or anything clinical, but about her life and experiences of what it’s actually like raising autistic kids. How her mindset had to change over time, how she dealt with expectations not lining up with reality, and the parts of parenting that people don’t always talk about openly. Especially the part where you lose your “normal” goals and your focus and ambitions completely shift. There is a lot she could cover.\n\nShe’s pretty hesitant and unsure whether anyone would want to read something like that. Additionally, she would need to dedicate a lot of time to it which is not easy, as my siblings require a lot of attention. I keep telling her that lived experience like hers could be really valuable, especially for parents who are new to this or feeling overwhelmed and alone.\n\nSo I figured I’d ask here. Do you think a book like that would be useful or interesting? If so, what would you like to learn more about? \n\nI’d really appreciate any thoughts, and I’d love to pass the feedback on to her.\n\nThanks for reading!", "score": 1, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1768044240.0, "id": "1q91qo4", "author": "Objective-Law-5512", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q91qo4/raising_3_autistic_kids_would_this_help_anyone/"}

It's not just the eyes alone, its the face of another individual as a whole. We may not be able to understand certain social cues, but some subconscious part of the brain designed for human interaction can still pick up the subtle cues a person makes when you interact with them. The problem is whether or not we can understand what we are seeing consciously. \n\nAs an individual, I can recognize the subtle cues when talking to an individual. Moreover, the area around the eye, nose, and upper cheek don't change as a person gets older. (I've seen a picture of my grandmother when she was younger and these facets are what made her identifiable despite the age difference.) \n\nI've also recall reading some post on this reddit of some autistic individuals being told by there therapist that they can read subtle cues better than others. \n\nSo at the end of the day, whether or not we make eye contact is equivalent to whether a person can understand the digital rain code from the matrix. It's either too detail for the individual to process, or they are able to read the subtle tics another person broadcast with their facial movements.

I live with my mom and it feels like an embarrassment. I was fired twice from my last two jobs.

I am now at a job that I love and good at with almost no bad people here, and it has benefits, but it's 31 hours and barely above minimum wage.\n\nI have friends. People do care about me. But not to the extent I feel like true best friends should be. I often don't reach out because I don't want to appear annoying and needy - they need to reach out to me (to which I am almost always agreeable).

Never been on a date, never been kissed, never had sex. I am also physically unattractive.\n\nBecause of adulthood and two very bad previous job experiences, I feel like I'm regressing on my autism. And because I have masked for so long - I have a complete lack of identity. I do not know who I am.\n\nI always hated my autism, but now I really despise it. I hate not being normal - like everyone else. There's no superpower to autism. It fucking sucks. If I could cure it, I would. We could live in a neurodiverse utopia and autism would still suck. It sucks because I still feel incredibly isolated. Not because people shun me - but because I naturally cannot connect with them. I can't tolerate or accept this.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I don’t think you’re wrong for not wanting to “accept” this. When people push acceptance too hard, it can feel like they’re asking you to be okay with a life that’s hurt you over and over. Anyone in your position would be exhausted, angry, and grieving something they never got.\n\nWhat comes through most in what you wrote isn’t failure or deficiency, it’s just how much you’ve had to endure while also having to mask, adapt, and keep going. The fact that you’re still here, still working, still caring about connection, says more about you than any label ever could.\n\nYou’re not broken for wanting closeness and identity and independence. Those aren’t unreasonable desires—they’re basic human ones. And the loneliness you describe doesn’t sound like “people don’t care,” it sounds like you’ve learned, very rationally, to protect yourself from rejection by staying quiet and agreeable. That’s a survival strategy that made sense at the time.\n\nI also want to say this clearly: hating autism doesn’t make you a bad or ungrateful person. You’re allowed to hate the parts of your life that have caused pain, isolation, and loss. Acceptance doesn’t have to mean liking it, celebrating it, or pretending it’s a gift. Sometimes it just means acknowledging reality without blaming yourself for it. That sadly, doesn't \"fix\" anything, or enable you to access more of the life toy want but can't get to by yourself. \n\nYou don’t have to figure out who you are all at once. Identity can be rebuilt slowly, in fragments, especially after years of masking. Even just noticing what drains you less, what feels slightly more you, might be enough, for a while.\n\nI know it may not feel like it, but nothing you wrote makes you unlovable, hopeless, or beyond connection. It just sounds like someone who’s been carrying too much alone for too long. You deserved better support than you got, and you still deserve understanding now.\n\nYou’re not weak for wanting what you don’t have yet.

That is because I don't really remember literally copying lines or social behaviors verbatim in the exaggerated or literal way it usually seems to be described. That would be silly and unnatural. I tried to learn things and adjust my behavior but I wasn't restricting it by a unnatural and direct mimicry process. I mention this because what I *do* find interesting and remembering doing, and perhaps still doing more unconsciously, is watching people and visual media not to so much to observe behaviors to perform myself but instead to observe these things, and especially body language and facial expressions, not to copy or explicitly understand their meanings, because I usually was good enough at context for general meanings and besides obvious expressions are already intuitive, but rather to track what emotions and feelings are involved in them and then actively train myself to not only associate those feelings but to generate and attach my own emotions and feelings to those typical or \"expected\" emotional states. Most importantly *not* just as a *behavioral response* but as in actual selective management of the emotional nuance. I've been thinking if this is a critical distinction to make and how it can connect to both masking and developmental trajectories. Sorry if this post is too nerdy way to say it for some people but I like to go beyond asking for common ground and reach for the conclusions or implications of commonalities.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "Need advice for working with autistic student", "text": "I want some advice from people. Sorry in advance that this is long.\n\nI am an EA who works with a 1st grade autistic girl. I'll call her Milly. Milly is pretty much non-verbal. She communicates through single words, shrieks, and short phrases. She is quite smart. She can count better than many of her peers, knows tons of words, and can read and spell well. She has a talking device, but doesn't really use it to communicate, just puts a bunch of words into it to play back and listen. I assume she understands everything I say, but I'm not sure how much she can relate emotionally. \n\nMilly is in a regular classroom with 21 other neurotypical kids. She doesn't participate in class activities. This is fine. She has a space at the back with a bunch of different toys and games. There are books to look at. She is allowed to pretty much wander around the room as she likes. We have another 'calm down' classroom down the hall she can go to, but there are no 'interesting' toys inside so she doesn't like to go. She can also go to the library for little breaks as well.\n\nI am Milly's 'break time/transition' teacher. I come in once in the morning for 20 minutes, an hour for lunch, and 20 minutes again in the afternoon. This is when her 'full time' EA takes breaks. My job is basically to keep her safe, keep the other kids safe, and keep the classroom as orderly as possible while she entertains herself or we do things together.\n\nHere is the problem. I have become Milly's 'bad teacher'. For a while we were getting along pretty well. We had some fun times. I generally like Milly. But recently, I have to tell her 'NO' all the time, and she gets very upset. There are signs all over the classroom that tell her which items are off limits. This includes the teacher's desk and many objects that are needed for learning activities. Many of these objects are very small and Milly does not clean up after herself. The teachers or other kids always have to do it and it can take a long time, which the teacher doesn't have. So I need to say NO. Usually I have to take things away from her or hold them down so she can't get into them. She likes to play with water and makes a mess of the bathroom and tries to bring the water to the classroom and makes a mess there. She wants to get things from high up on top of cabinets and starts picking up chairs across the room to climb up and get things. I have to hold the chair down to stop it from becoming dangerous. She throws snow at people's faces on the playground (which can contain ice, dirt, all kinds of things) and I'm again telling her \"NO! I don't like that! It hurts!\" She has hit kids who unknowingly upset her with things like humming or singing quietly when they walk by her. I've grabbed her to try and stop her, but she wiggles out of my arms and goes after the other kid. I told her \"Hitting is mean!\" but without any response, I don't know if that matters at all to her.\n\nWhen she gets upset, she can meltdown and scream. She does some self-injurious behaviors. Sometimes this can last for 30 minutes or more while other kids are in the room. Then she calls me 'bad teacher', tells me to go away, and has thrown some stuff at me too.\n\nI don't want to be her 'bad teacher'. I want to have a nice relationship. But there are rules I need to follow as an employee and rules she needs to follow as a member of the class. It sucks she can't be messy and I understand she might be bored. I don't make any choices about her IEP or what she can and can't do or touch in the classroom. I probably seem very very mean, because I'm often stopping her from doing what she wants, telling her she can't have things she wants, and sometimes need to physically remove things from her hands or remove her hands from things. I really don't like or want to do this. Maybe she would do better in a different kind of classroom that could be built more around her needs, but that is not an option right now. She is in this class and we all want to make the best of it for her and the other kids.\n\nSo I want advice on how I can still make a good relationship with Milly. I want us to have some fun together. I want school to be a good experience for her. I don't want her to think teachers just want to make her miserable. We don't. Is there anything I can do or say to help her? Is there a way to balance our bad experiences together with better ones?\n\nShe does act this way with her other EAs as well, but I think our time together is particularly triggering because it is a transition and lunch time is very chaotic already with the other kids being noisy and all over the place. (She used to eat in a the calm down class before but no longer wants to go there because there are no more toys. She always has the option to leave, but doesn't want to.)", "score": 3, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768016444.0, "id": "1q8tl3a", "author": "Scared-Doubt5828", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q8tl3a/need_advice_for_working_with_autistic_student/"}

They might ask you directly about how you handle figures of speech or metaphors etc, which would give the chance to mention this. Though they will also be noting your responses throughout the assessment as well. \n\nThe assessment is more than just your answers. They record a lot about how you respond, in which ways, what are your behaviors, and they prolly have you taking diagnostic tests to help them in the evaluation. \n\nNow all this said I can say in my own experience literalism for me is about being unable to understand the context of words without extra thinking. When I hear the metaphor/saying 'kill two birds with one stone' I always see a visual image of two birds getting killed (sadly) and then have to mentally remind myself they don't actually mean killing birds, they mean doing two things with one action.  This plays out in other ways where someone might be just being sarcastic/venting/ planning and I'll respond in a very literal way to their question/statement ( Person: Next Tuesday we are going out. Me: Oh you mean tomorrow or the following Tuesday. Person:  Obviously next Tuesday is the next Tuesday as in next week. Me: Right, in my head isn't the next Tuesday tomorrow.)Then a few seconds to a minute later I realized what was meant. This is both a precision issue but also a literal issue in the sense of taking the meaning of these words at their literal meaning. Missing the contexts of based off the whole conversation clearly they didn't mean tomorrow Tuesday.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767978156.0, "id": "nymkw06", "author": "Agreeable-Tooth-3345"}

Having already done oodles of research about adult autism, I was actually a little angry at first because I felt dismissed.

Looking at my alternative options, there are only 1-2 places in my entire state that can diagnose adults and the \"trustworthy\" one doesn't take insurance and is $2,500 out of pocket. Even one of the Universities I'm near that has courses on teaching students the diagnosis process doesn't accept adults as candidates for example. \n\nSo here is where I landed. I am pretty much stuck with self diagnosis simply because of lack of options. What I've told my therapist is that even if I'm not, the resources that I've found from the community have helped me in a lot of ways and if that's the best I can do then that's about the best I could have done with a diagnosis anyway. The only thing the diagnosis brings (if you don't need assistance) is peace of mind, a leg to stand on, and the ability to have a protected status. But at my work, ADHD and Autism both fall under Neurodivergent, so even ADHD qualifies for that protection.\n\nSimply put, we're just at the mercy of the knowledge that's out there and that knowledge hardly covers adults.

I know people, occasionally chat with people I knew in high school, but I wouldn't say I have close friends or even consider those high school people friends.

We were together for 4 years, but we broke up a few months ago. So that was where a lot of my social energy went. That and trying to get through school which has been insanely difficult for me. \n\nIt wasn't until we split that I realized how small my social circle is. They were my best friend for those 4 years, and I regret not trying to make more friends while in the relationship, but I know why I didn't want to.

Improvising doesn’t often go well, but I think I’ve gotten used to it. Now, I let myself go, even when I don't know what to say or when I feel the other person becoming awkward or misunderstanding the context.\n\n​This approach doesn’t guarantee that the call will be successful, but it saves me from getting anxious beforehand and allows me to live more in the moment.

Maybe try to think of good excuses to go on mute or hold the call so you can decellerate und regain focus? I also think most people don’t mind when you‘re less chatty as long as you‘re trying to be polite 😌 or at least I hope so 🤓 practise makes perfect, better scripts help aswell and maybe you can look up extra „small talk for phone calls“ on Google and try something out. You can also try and rehearse important calls with friends or people you‘re comfortable with on Discord or from a comfy &amp; safe space/place before you practise with a phone &amp; friends and once it feels good you can go for the real deal? \n\nSurprise calls unfortunately always catch me off guard and my phone is on constant DnD because of that.

My one good friend ans her two friends basically go to musicals and concerts a lot, we're all theater fans. But the last two times werent very nice. \n\nWe had sideways facing seats, so we all had to look to the right to see the stage. And I was sitting all the way on the right, so if I wanted to see the stage, I didnt see my friends, and vice versa. I tried looking back every now and then to see of I was missing out on something, having fun togwther, but didnt spot anything (I'm also shorter, especially to the friend I was sitting next to, and I think the flppr was also lower where I stood), but at one moment she tapped me to get me to join, because they were all dancing and my best friend (on the left) was making a video.\n\nAt the end, my friend mentioned that she was gonna send the videos, but that she was sorry I wasnt in it that much, because I was sitting so far away, and to please not take it personally. I felt kinda shitty though. Not for them not being able to include me, because seeing from all the videos they made together, they definitely looked at me or hoped Id look back to join in, but because I just didnt know how to handle stuff like that. I dont wanna look back every ten seconds just in case theyre doing something together that I could connect with, but I also do sort of want to connect with them. Like I felt like such a loner, them having fun together and me just looking at the concert by myself. Besides that, I also dont know how to act. Like in my room or with my one friend, Im fine dancing and being silly, but in a concert I just cant.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I like them because music drowns out the rest of the things around me and I can just become immersed in the experience. \n\nGiven that, the music must be music I feel is “pleasing to my senses” otherwise I would totally hate it being in something like that Travis Scott crowd crush, is where I would be in hell. Not a place i could handle and I’d probably scream so loud until I had the entire thing stop. \n\nBut the last Tool concert I went to last month was complete sensory immersion and amazing. I had another autistic and ADHD friend with me but he’s a music nerd and we talked to some other musical people but most people who go to Tool (or music adjacent to tool or whatever my taste is I’m very musically diverse ) don’t really go to socialise.. they go for the music. \n\nIf they talk they talk about the music. Sometimes I find with my more mainstream artists I have found it a little overwhelming and I just have to wait until the artist comes on but I use it to get into the good area so I have optimal positioning and comfort. \nIf it’s not possible, I’ve opened up to talking to new people and they are as equally as weird and hyperfixated on the music as I am because the music I listen to and love isn’t really mainstream. It’s very niche and alternative/indie/progressive rock. So people don’t really have anything besides the music to talk about and they are musically inclined. \n\nIf it was a band artist or music I was not attuned or interested in. Which happened when I was a teenager and my old friend forced me to attend Lady Gaga and another time The Pussycat Dolls, I had a horrid experience. I even took MDMA at an electro music festival which isn’t my genre but I went and it was awful. I left early as I wanted to just die and curl and sleep from the sensory overwhelm. \n\nSo I’ve learnt to be immersed with what I am really into musically. I don’t even need to attend concerts with anyone but myself anymore. It took years to go into that state comfortably. \n\nNow when I do I fully immerse myself into the moment. I don’t care if people think it’s weird, or what I look like. I spend a time and energy hyper focusing on music and it’s probably one of my passions. \n\nI make music and sing myself so I kind of channel my passion when I’m in the concert to releasing all the pain, frustration and hurt I’ve experienced built up over years that any specific artist or band has helped me cope with and discharging that energy with the experience of being immersed in the music if that makes sense. \n\nIn that way the concert becomes less of a social experience for me, and more of a sensory and emotionally regulating one that can be extremely cathartic. I see music as colours and sounds as shapes in my minds eye (yes I’m sober). So it’s an whole sensory experience for me \n\nWhat I DONT like is the traveling to and from the concerts. I hate crowded buses and trains and especially if it’s on a Friday and Saturday night in my city. I don’t currently have my own car so having to travel back on the crowded transport and risk being around drunk people who may or may not vomit from alcohol but are also loud, obnoxious and really unstable in what they say or do. \n\nOne night I was walking through the city after a concert and I saw a kid being held up after he was kicked out of a bar. I had to make my train by midnight or risk missing the interconnecting bus home. I knew he was about to throw up EVERYWHERE ( as someone who was around a lot of drunk people, and struggled with emetophobia.\n\ni was unable to not cross the road without risking missing the train. I also couldn’t avoid the oncoming cars without risking my life. I got annoyed the people who were with him knew his state and wouldn’t make him go and sit down in a gutter to vomit. But he did it all over where we had to cross the road.. \n\nthose things being out trigger sensory overwhelm for me. And other sounds and noises people make unexpectedly or incoherently which are unnecessary when they are inconsiderate or unpredictable or behave in ways that are infringing my personal space.. for some reason 2pm on Thursday people won’t be like this but by 10pm on Saturday night people become degenerate in my city, and it’s illogical. \n\n\nIf I am at an event I don’t resonate with as I have done in the past I will feel and experience the things you wrote about. \n\nIt signals something is wrong and I need to change my environment or risk being in overwhelm. \n\nWhich is how I feel about being around wildly intoxicated people commuting on the weekend. \n\nAlso: in your situation: \n\n\nAlso, those friends don’t sound like attuned friends. \n\nI wouldn’t feel comfortable in that setting if at all. \n\nBut I get treated like that by my family and extended family who are in my age the same way. (Like my cousins, sister in law, siblings). \n\nMaking videos and photos and group chats and not being included. I’m just there. \nAn outsider. A bystander. \nEh. \nNot my people. \n\nSo I am used to it, and I immediately know when people are doing it to me socially at events after my entire life was scapegoated. \n\nI just remove myself and have become happy to be alone rather than feel alone when the people I’m supposed to be “friends” with implicitly or explicitly have signalled out group vs in group cues to me. \n\nI’m always in the out group. \n\nIt signals to me:\n\nThose aren’t my people. \n\nI never try to make others feel like that, at least to my awareness. \n\nIt takes time to find people who resonate with you. I still haven’t. \n\nThe entire situation just sounds like it put your nervous system on hyper alert and you weren’t even allowed to enjoy the event because you were socially monitoring for opportunities.. \n\nit doesn’t even sound like it’s a you problem. It really sounds like something that signals that you maybe don’t align, or fit to that group of people anymore and perhaps other people in the world could provide better connection. \n\nIt doesn’t matter how you act, a lot of people are there for the music and don’t care how you act because they aren’t there for anything but the artist. You don’t have to dance or move at all concert. \n\nI’ve seen many bands where I’ve been the only person in the entire mosh pit moving and that was a metal band and I was dancing which is not normal for someone watching a band like Mastodon. \n\nBut I don’t care for social norms. A lot of people just stand there and watch and enjoy it, they don’t sing. They don’t move. \nThey don’t dance. \nSome do. \nThat’s personal preference and that’s perfectly normal to be someone who doesn’t even want or like the experience at all..\n\nSo it’s all about you knowing what you like or need and want and communicating that firstly, to yourself and then to whoever you are spending the time with. \n\nDo you have any therapist to talk this type of situation over with? \n\nIt sounds to me that finding what your specific preferences are and being able to communicate them clearly in social contexts, or what you would like or need from friendships or situations socially, to  understanding yourself better which could help you in the future. \n\nYou aren’t doing anything wrong either.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768045921.0, "id": "nyrtm93", "author": "Templeofrebellion"}

It makes me happy to do what my inner child likes, but the more I do, the more people avoid me. And I don't want to go back to masking because really a few, like probably 3 in 100 people find me nice and I will probably keep being myself just for them.\n\nLike I was hella extroverted as a kid, like hella, but still had no friends. I was very overstimulated, very easygoing but anytime I would come to someone and try to be friends, they just didn't like me. And I fucking love my inner child so much but in the end of the day I'm left hella lonely all the time.\n\nI know with which conditions I'll be loved but it's not me.

But when I'm me, I'm the loneliest person and I can't help it\n\nI look at the guys in their 21th and they are normal but I feel like a child. I like flowers, I like skirts, I like painting my nails, I sleep with plushies. I feel like a 10yo kid who can be responsible and pay for his rent.

I don't like all those cool black/grey clothes, girlfriends, hella cool cars, being like tall and lifting weights. I don't like that. I want my wedding to be with a guy when I have all those cute jewellery on me and a Rapunzel's song playing during our first dance.\n\nOfc I feel stupid + autistic and everything just falls into the same hole that idk if there will be anyone who will ever love me for who I am.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "Aprosodia and autism: for the neuroscience nerds", "text": "I’m a medical student with autism, and today we learned about cortical deficits including language aphasias. Aprosodia refers to a deficit where the cadence of a person’s speech is unusual. Speech may be flat, words and syllables may be improperly stressed, or tone may not match the emotion one is trying to convey. I try not to diagnose myself during lecture, but I thought, this sounds just like me! I’ve learned to mask it very well over time, but tone and cadence are a conscious function for me. If I’m not masking, people misidentify my emotions, believing I’m frustrated when I’m content, or assuming my excitement is disingenuous because of my flat speech. I watched childhood home videos of myself and found that my speech was either flat or overly melodic, like I was copying a cartoon character. From time to time, people also don’t know when I’m done with my sentence because I end it with an upward inflection. It’s all speculation, but I think a lot of masking is rerouting a function to a different part of your brain to accommodate for a deficit. I wonder if my prefrontal cortex is working overtime to fill in the gaps. The need to create strong connections between areas of the brain may also explain why I’m great at patterns and why I have synesthesia.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I assume you're trying to build muscle. You should read and watch about appropriate form for your exercises. You'll want to move fast on the concentric and a controlled 1-sec eccentric (control is important, but going slow doesn't buy much). Most people do not push to failure, and that is crucial (eventually, you'll want to leave some reps in reserve, but it is better to err on the side of lifting to failure if you aren't sure). You're gonna struggle to get growth if you aren't pushing yourself to your limits. Your working set (not the warmup you do early to ensure you're ready to give your best performance) should have between 5-12 reps (once I can do 8 reps, I usually increase the weight). You should literally fail to complete the last rep; if that didn't occur, you aren't trying hard enough. I usually only do 1-2 working sets per exercise, but I keep a full body routine that has overlap. So, each muscle is a primary mover for about 10 sets each week (you might not need that much at first, and there are severe diminishing returns to doing too much). I go twice a week. Rest is extremely important, as is ensuring you're consuming enough protein. I've found caffeine right before workout is useful to maximizing my focus and effort, as well as some carbs beforehand to ensure I've got the energy. Creatine is worthy, too, but only after you've really been practicing correctly. You'll want to find the routine that fits where you're at with the equipment you have; it's something that evolves with you, and you explore with that gameplan (there's a lot of ways to do it, so worth exploring).

Alternatively it is kind of a look away and then sharply pull back to center but at angle. If you have a propensity to look to your sides (and more so if you also look down or up) and then pull back to focus directly at a person while they talking to you (especially if they are standing to the side of you), then that might come off as rolling more often I think going from my memory at the moment. I know personally I often switch the focus of my gaze often and either fixate pointedly at something (stare essentially) or follow along it and examine it visually in a way that goes beyond just looking at it. I think that these visual behaviors from autistic people can very often be conflated with social signals when they actually aren't.

This could mean a hyper area of abnormal focus (only maps of WW 2 and nothing more no facts nothing, could also be being pressed with an artist and collecting everything bit information and stuff about them).\n\nEdit: the biggest difference though is that an autistic person meets all of the DSM-V or ICD-11 criteria. This means the criteria A of social difficulties and for the DSM-V 2 of the 4 criteria B: restricted/repetitive behaviors. Special interests fall under criteria B and anyone could have a special interest but met no other criteria.

For some time now, about a couple of years or so, my therapist, who has been accompanying me for almost a decade, has expressed the near certainty that I have level 1 autism.

I can spend hours collecting old maps and pictures from Wikimedia Commons, even forgoing sleep entirely, or focusing almost obsessively with a past nation, like the German Empire or the Byzantine Empire, and spending the day thinking about them;\n\n• Walking on tip-toes, and avoiding eye contact;\n\n• Listening to the same song over and over again (my personal record was listening to Albatross, by Fleetwood Mac, 53 times in a row!);\n\n• Never having had a romantic relationship, or even kissed someone, as much as I've fallen in love before and tried \"shooting my shot\" then;\n\n• Having been called \"extremely intelligent\" and \"gifted\" throughout my life, with some elementary school classmates mentioning that I learned to read much faster than they did, and that they were scared of me, due to my supposed \"giftedness\";\n\n• Being somewhat rigid with what I wear, since I really dislike shorts, for instance.\n\nStill, I find it hard to believe I might actually be autistic. I've done a number of tests with my therapist, and all of them point towards neurodivergence, but always at the very border between it and \"neutotypicalness\".

We are both autistic and she gets overwhelmed easily, so we reduced the frequency of contact to make it more manageable for her. We still talk regularly, but not every day.\n\nWe have both been in narc relationships, but hers was much longer than mine.

She just doesn't want a relationship.\n\nSo, this was a year ago and we have been talking as friends since. Obviously she knows I carry a torch for her, but I don't bring it up.\n\nAnyway, I went quiet the past few days because I have a ton of college work to focus on, and she messaged me today checking whether I was okay. I let her know why I was quiet and we chatted for a bit.\n\nShe let me know she had caught up on messenger with an old friend and they were reminiscing about old times. He lives 200 miles away, doesn't drive and is also autistic.\n\nShe said \"so we will have to see how that goes\" as if they were dating. I said \"Oh. I thought you were a dedicated singleton these days\" and she said she still is and she seriously doubts she will see this guy.\n\nAnyway, my heart *sank*. I really care about her and I don't know what I'll do if she meets someone else. I feel she might be writing me off because I am younger than her, but it's not that much. \n\nMy brother thinks she might be inadvertently keeping me on the hook in case... That might be it, but she wouldn't do that deliberately. She is a lovely person. She is probably still healing, but I just wish she could see us together. She told me I know her better than anyone. \n\nI'm just feeling super mixed up, constantly anxious, sick, and am worried how badly I will take it if she meets another guy.

I was diagnosed with Autism around 2023, but I don't think at the time I was able to understand what it meant. Nowadays, though, I find it very hard to walk around WITHOUT noticing it. \n\nOne of the biggest things I have struggled with is communicating with other people over intellectual matters. I am unable to process math audibly, and rarely can I read something like math and understand what the person's thought process was or how it makes sense. I have the same struggle when reading code. I can find it incredibly time consuming to read code. I have to use my own language to describe some things.\n\nFor example, I will call a deck a \"porch\" because of its front-of-door properties (a recent example that confused the people around me). I can only describe people by their previous actions or interesting facts about them, but I don't know their names.\n\nHowever, I am certainly gifted. I've not really found many things hard to understand in life except for their obtuse symbolism. I've gotten 1/6 on the Putnam without knowing much math beyond calculus, and I've gotten perfect SATs/AP scores in high school. I taught myself programming at a young age. I know that empirically, I know what I am doing and can confirm my answers logically. I passed school and my bosses in professional life have all treated me with great respect and regard.  \n  \nI spend a lot of time reading about concepts from other domains, but I almost always have to come up with \"my own way\" to understand it. If people \"talk math\" at me, my brain just can't absorb it. It has made it really hard to read books or make sense of lectures. I was only really able to learn in college by looking at the homework problems.\n\nThis has made it really hard to work with other people on intellectual stuff, since we just don't speak the same language. At work, I find myself always isolated to work on code alone. I feel pervasively lonely because I would love to find people to work or research with, but I can't find anyone to speak with!\n\nDoes anyone else feel similar?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "The term \"masking\" is very subjective. For some \"masking\" means pretty much anything that isn't the default of what they feel like doing (even something like trying to eat healthier instead of comfort food), and others use it in the stricter definition of \"hiding autistic traits to fit in\". However that then depends on what one considers an autistic trait vs a personality one and if there's intent or not. \n\nI worked on improving my communication skills as it makes life easier and I actually wanted to do that, like countless other people, NT or ND, which is why there are infinite books, courses or resources focusing on communication skills. \n\nHowever, if I feel like stimming or watching the same series on repeat for the 15th time, I don't have an issue with that. \n\nMy question is always \"how is this serving me?\". Being accidentally rude doesn't serve me as I don't like offending people, so I make an effort to soften my language, but ensuring that I only have social interactions in quiet places helps, so I'll keep insisting on that. \n\nAll of this to say that if you're trying to make your life easier, that's all good and well, just be mindful of not cancelling yourself in the process. Others may not agree, but it's your life, so do what's right for you. \n\nSince we're all different, it's hard to recommend any books/resources as we all have different challenges. For example, I don't have social anxiety so that makes socialising already much easier, but I have severe sensory issues and I can't bypass those, so adjust accordingly. \n\nMy main issue was bluntness and a very rigid black/white all/nothing thinking, so that's what I've worked on over the years, as well as my perfectionism and some other traits. Someone else may have different pressing issues. \n\nIt may be easier if you were to post about specific challenges and see what anyone recommends. Personally, and I know I'm in the minority on this, I don't focus on finding resources for autistic people only, as I've found helpful stuff in \"NT books\" too, it depends on the author.

Secondly, I am not challenging your choices in any way - I'm just interested, and have thoughts and would like to discuss them. \n\nFor context I was relatively recently diagnosed with ASD/ADHD at age 37, so my experience might be quite different to yours (in that particular way, everyone's experiences are unique regardless of how similar).\n\nMasking: I think I get your meaning about your dislike of the term \"masking\" in regard to alluding to not affecting actual change. I prefer to think of it in physical terms - when you're \"masking\" you're contorting yourself into a shape the world finds acceptable, and it can be exhausting holding yourself in that shape. So \"unmasking\" would be akin to allowing yourself to stop contorting and revert to a more natural shape that requires less energy to maintain.\n\nTo continue my analogy, and put it in the context of wanting to reduce your autistic traits, you're trying to determine that shape yourself - which I think is entirely do-able! However, it's like altering the configuration of something that is made of blocks. You need to switch blocks around to ensure you maintain structural integrity, and some blocks are similar and can be swapped while others are not. \n\nMy point: so maybe it's not a question of just reducing the autistic traits, which would be like removing blocks without switching them and might lead to the whole thing collapsing, rather it would require compromise in terms of moving specific blocks around to get as close to the shape you want as possible. Some of the shapes you want to move might not be able to because there's no way to move them without potentially causing the whole thing to crumble.\nSo, for example accommodating more self care/recovery time between things that drain your capacity,so that you have the structural integrity maintain shape for specific things. (Like contorting into the old shape when you need to e.g. presenting a specific type of demeanour in a customer service setting/people facing job).\n\nTl;dr self-awareness and self-compassion are the keys to reducing certain autistic traits, but might require you to accept others. \n\nAre there specific traits you are finding problematic and want to reduce?", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768041896.0, "id": "nyrm1cs", "author": "vVolv"}

It's fun!\". the physical and psychological harms weren't evident yet, although I already FELT incapable of being easily sociable unless I had some drinks in me  \n  \n  From 22 onwards it was a dark, lonely spiral where it no longer worked as well. I needed more and more to feel similar effects. I got sloppy and weird in social settings more and more often, and did shit I regretted. Eventually I stopped socializing at all, and drank heavily, alone. Horrible hangovers started. My mental health was RUINED by rebound anxiety, insomnia, greater sensitivity to sensory overload unless I was black out drunk. It threatened my ability to work and maintain the few relationships that felt genuine and meaningful  \n  \n  Heh, not to belabour the point, but if there are 2 things I could go back to that 14 year old self and change?  \n  \n  1. I wish I would have known I was autistic, and was able to start the journey of learning ways to adjust, grow my strengths, and manage my \"weaknesses\"  \n  \n2. I wish I would have real-ized what a dark pit of despair drinking would bog me down in, barely able to struggle above the surface to gulp another quick breath  \n  \n  I wish you all the best :)   Hell, I've managed to be sober 3 of the last 6 years. I feel like realizing I'm autistic explains SO much of why I started drinking. Typing this with noise cancelling headphones on.

It’s my first year and I just started the second semester, and I want to improve on my struggle with executive dysfunction.\n\nI don’t know why exactly, but my struggles with executive dysfunction have worsened since graduating high school. It felt like less of a problem in my day to day life before I graduated, but now as a college student its become so difficult to manage that I ended up failing a few classes because I couldn’t get myself to actually finish any assignments, despite being really interested in the material.\n\nThis is pretty gross and embarrassing to admit, but it’s to the point where I oftentimes I forget/put off basic self care. I won’t eat for days and will forget to shower and brush my teeth, and it’s honesty a struggle to even get myself out of bed and switch between doing one thing to the other. Self care is just so low on my list of priorities because it just doesn’t matter to me much, seeing as I rarely have a reason to leave the house/my room anyways\n\nI in no way am trying to excuse my lack of motivation and work ethic, I have to accept that this is my own fault and struggle that I have to work around and fix myself. With that being said, it almost felt like this wall was keeping me from actually doing anything. The want and drive to finish the task is there, but it feels impossible actually getting myself up to finish it. Then the anxiety plagues me for weeks that I have something to do, but I’m too lazy to actually do anything.\n\nOnce I actually do start working on something though I generally get a decent amount of work done, which is why I’m adverse to taking breaks, because I know I’ll just struggle to get back to work afterwards.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with me?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "Teeth can absolutely hurt, we have nerves in them. Our teeth are made of layers- a soft inner layer called the pulp, rich with nerve endings.

At the very outside, there is the enamel, a thin and extremely hard outer layer which protects the dentin from bacteria, acidic foods, and damage from chewing. \n\nYour dentin has small, fluid-filled channels which lead to the pulp, where cold, heat and acid can travel through these channels and into the pulp, leading to pain. You will be more sensitive to this if you have thinner or damaged enamel. \n\nVibrations in the dentin, from certain food textures, vibrating toothbrushes, dental tools, loud sounds, or impacts can all travel through the channels in the dentin and into the nerve-dense pulp, causing pain. Again, this is more likely if you have poor enamel.\n\nSo the pain from “scratchy” foods is not just imagined, it is a legitimate pain signal from nerves inside your teeth becoming irritated. :)", "score": 12, "created_utc": 1767888381.0, "id": "nyf3o9v", "author": "KickProcedure"}

But when I hear a sad story, see something bad happen, or hear a story so fucked up anyone else would feel nauseous, I have a hard time caring deeper than a simple \"Yeah, I kind of expected that.\" I once considered working a job in aftermath services because I knew it wouldn't have effected me as deeply as anyone else. Maybe I just have come to the understanding that there are more bad people than good in this world. But I remember a time when I probably would have cared, but don't now. That's kind of why when people tell me their problems I don't let them use me as a venting buddy or shoulder to cry on, I can really only give them solutions and if they don't want solutions I just get frustrated. I really just can't be bothered to care for someone unless I already know I love them. Which is like, seven people. I have to pretend for society's sake but after a while that gets exhausting. I'm either numb, frustrated occasionally, or only happy and calm when I'm alone and can do my own thing in peace.\n\nAnd before anyone suggests, no, I'm not ASPD. I hardly meet any of the diagnostic criteria for something like that. I just have very selective empathy and see nothing wrong with that at all. A lot of autistic people go on and on about how sweet and nurturing and kind they are but I've never truly felt that way.

Unlike Data, who will ask for clarification and is often seen as “adorable” for his autistic traits, Worf usually doubles down on whatever he did, refusing to change out of embarrassment and wounded pride. Worf is used to being told he’s doing things wrong, and I think a lot of us can relate to that.

I passed, but now that I’m hired, I want to make sure I can manage myself in that kind of setting without drawing unwanted attention.\nI’ve tried things like holding something heavy or weighted in my hands, which helps a bit, but I’d love tips from others on ways to calm myself when stimming openly isn’t an option.

Mostly I rely on the same packaged foods (dumplings, Korean rice cake with soy sauce and some other things) because I have 0 energy to cook or prepare food. Personal hygiene (minus hair washing since that's obvious) - a catastrophe. Cleaning my place  or taking out the trash - once every couple weeks. I crash when I get back home, sit in the dark and play a little on my phone since I feel like I'm run over. I also sleep not that much (usually 4-6,5h) but i naturally wake up and even with longer hours never feel rested.\n\n\nPlease tell me I'm not alone and that there is someone who is actually able to make it work, because everything is taking more and more a toll and I just want to dig a hole and never get out anymore.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767961508.0, "id": "1q86xha", "author": "ia_desu", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q86xha/how_does_anyone_manage_juggling_it_all/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "Ok let‘s do a few of them, but short, I ain‘t got enough time for details rn:\n\n- Philosophy:\nNothing has a 100% chance of being true other than this very sentence\n\n- Psychology:\nIt is impossible for any thinking being to not try their best because that‘s all that neurons CAN do\n\n- Deltarune:\nGerson Boom, the character used to show the player (and susie) that the rules / the prophecy can indeed be changed, is a reference to a super smash bros tournament, in which the player boom didn‘t like the map chosen (hyrule castle) and used a tactic called turtling in his match against gerson, causing the match to take around 53 minutes, ultimately resulting in hyrule castle not having been used in the tournament anymore\n\n- Sonic:\nEggman is a scientist gone evil due to his grandfathers neglection, which caused him to be attention seeking. While called a narcissist by the official wiki, he has shown to have empathy multiple times, as though it might not seem that way. Like knuckles, he is also a feminist. His failure against sonic also isn‘t really a sign of failure, but it‘s impressive he even gets so close. He recognizes the impossibility of stopping sonics speed, which is why he rather resorts to an army of badniks to lower sonics stamina. As that also fails, he willingly gives sonic the chaos emeralds, for the sole reason that he has a machine that cant capture sonic, but capture the chaos emerald, causing super sonic to be less of a threat to robotnik than sonic. He also built metal sonic, which is confirmed to be so perfect, he beat the entire sonic team within days while eggman was gone, only being stopped by eggmans return, who metal planned to overthrow. Literally no one can beat eggman other than sonic, and one of the only characters that can beat sonic was built by dr eggman.\n\n- Bloons Tower Defense:\nThe games are confirmed to be chronologically correct, meaning „Bloons“ was the first event recorded. It isn‘t mentioned in the story of grandpa quincy though, meaning it‘s probably hidden knowledge. In that game, monkeys pop stationary bloons in perfectly crafted death puzzles engineered to make total bloon annihilation possible with an exactly calculated number of darts. Only later btd1 released, meaning that the monkeys are the aggressors. This also explains why bloons don‘t attack monkeys, because they are solely fleeing from the monkeys. The heroes putting all their heartblood into „stopping“ bloons shows how they got indoctrinated by the capitalistic scheme. There also is proof of monkey wars, religious fanatism and the extinction of ancient tribes", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1767870442.0, "id": "nydmtiv", "author": "MegarcoandFurgarco"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "My special interest / hyper fixation / who-knows-but-it's-consuming-everything-in-my-life is linguistics. I love collecting English words, and have been collecting a personal assorted lexicon for 3  years, which presently constitutes of 159 words, each with their definitions and ratings out of 10 to 1 decimal place. I store this \"Word Trove\" in an Excel spreadsheet. They are rated based on euphony (how nice they sound), as well as how poetic the definition is, and personal resonance. \n\n\nI also love looking into linguistics as a whole, and finding niche and fun grammatical constructs and terms. I use this research to expand on my conlang (abbreviation of \"constructed language\"), called Solcsqe (Solsch when Anglicised), a naturalistic, synthetic, fusional language based on European languages with inspiration from both Germanic and Romance words, as well as some rare grammatical features, because in the setting it is a dying language. \n\n\n I could ramble on about it but I'll just say that currently I have a basic grammar system, the IPA for every letter in the Solstian alphabet and some notes on stress and digraphs and hard/soft rules, also maybe a little over a thousand root words, and I am working in world building for Lüqud Solste (Luchod Solst). If you are interested, everything is compiled on NationStates under the name Luchod Solst.\n\n\nThe main focus is the conlang, so there isn't much world building. There is just enough to get a feeling for the culture and values of the Republic. Also, it's all very amateur and things get retconned a lot. But it's just a passion project for fun anyway.\n\n\nAnyways sorry for the rant! My brain is actually being consumed.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "Oh well you asked for it. So my main special interest is on spirituality and the origin of all. So, few things to know (that are really hard to understand even by reading this):\n\n&gt; You're not a body, you're a spirit. Yes, by test and scientific proof, even tho the scientific community don't want to admit that. \n\n&gt; The nature of a spirit is to be alive. Spirit is life per se, independent of anything else. The body depends on a lot to be alive, but the spirit just is alive, regardless\n\n&gt; Therefore, immortal is a characteristic of being a spirit. The body dies, you go on like you just dropped a heavy jacket\n\n&gt; But saying that the spirit is life is an eufemism. In fact, there is only one single life \"manifesting\" throughout the universe\n\n&gt; That single life is beyond relativity. No, not only Eisten's relativity, I'm talking any kind of relativity: dead or alive, being and not being, good and evil, cold or hot, up or down, now and then, any dichotomy only exists as an expression of Life. Because the absolute life makes expressions, for expressions to exist, duality has to come into play. An apple couldn't be an apple if it also was the entire universe, it would be everything, not an apple, get it?\n\n&gt; So what we experience here on a duality level is the Absolute Life perceiving it's own expressions. As Absolute, the Life can perceive everything recursively, from the minor subatomic particles to the major universal structures, giving rise to many points of view. Those points of view kinda are Life itself just as well, they are Life perceiving Life. And as such they think they are individuals. They think they are different spirits.\n\n&gt; And no, this is not by mistake. This is only because any point of perception needs to start small, from not perceiving anything, to then becoming big, by perceiving everything. So the first thing a focus of perception notices is itself. Perception perceiving itself, it thinks it is Life by itself at first. Later, by perceiving other focuses of perception thinking the same thing all around, it thinks each different point of focus of perception must be a different entity.\n\n&gt; But as perception becomes greater and greater, encompassing all that is physical, mental, emotional, philosophical, spiritual, etc etc, the connection, rather the one-ness of all of the beings starts to become apparent. As such, you can deduce this one-ness (as I'm talking about it) way before you can even perceive it in full.\n\n&gt; In conclusion, there is only one Life, above duality, that perceives it's own expressions in a recursively manner. Life is everything we see or perceive, both what we think is alive and what we don't think is alive. Both you and me, and anyone else. Animals, plants, rocks, stars, planets and atoms. Life not simply is everywhere, it is everything and every-not-thing.\n\n&gt; In this sense, everytime you are looking at someone else, you are looking at yourself (this also comes into play in psychology as you may know). So when you like someone, you're liking yourself. When you dislike someone, you dislike yourself. When you love someone, hate someone, punch someone, poison someone, say good things to someone, gives a gift to someone, pet your baby dog, give a hug to a friend, give water to a plant or simply admire a flying eagle, even if you think someone is disgusting, pathetic, below you, above you, whatever, you are doing all of those things to yourself, consciously or unconsciously. \n\n&gt; And no, you don't need to believe a word I'm saying, even tho I studied it for years with as much skepticism as anyone else. You just live your life and tell me when you die. Or way after, when you start seeing (or deducing) the one-ness of it all.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767875307.0, "id": "nydxmbz", "author": "aori_chann"}

Joe, mumbo, and cleo are also all still on the server. at the time of season 2, mumbo was already an established YouTuber,  but he was 17, which no one knew at the time. now, they only invite adults, since one of the things that sets hermitcraft apart is their maturity and professionalism (but theyre also still fun and silly and childish in the good ways), and inviting young people to servers has caused a lot of drama in the past (cough cough dream smp). but luckily mumbo was very mature, and no one even knew how young he was until much later, so it was never an issue, but pretty much everyone on the server says they would not be comfortable inviting someone that young again. mumbo recently turned 30, so he is an old man. the other requirements for being invited now is that you must have an established YouTube channel so that everyone can trust that you will behave professionally when you get the huge boost in audience that everyone gets when joining hermitcraft, and every current member must agree that you are a good fit. if even one person says no, then you wont be invited.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767939523.0, "id": "nyjurfu", "author": "im_a_cryptid"}

I’ve been no-contact with my abusive family for a while now, and I’ve been working on reclaiming my identity. Part of that process, for me, is a legal name change. I’ve settled on a name that means the world to me symbolically, but I know it’s… a lot. I’d appreciate some outside perspective.\n\nThe name I’ve chosen is: Jupiter-Gabriel João Phoenix.\n\nI know it sounds unconventional, but every part of it has deep meaning for me. I wanted to explain the symbolism, because this isn't just a whim, it's a map of my journey.\n\n\\-Jupiter: This was a nickname given to me by my uncle, the only family member who wasn't an enabler or an abuser. I was obsessed with space as a kid, and he told me I was brave and had a \"big spirit,\" so the name Jupiter fit. He called me that for the rest of his life. For me, \"Jupiter\" evolved to represent hope, the future, and the one person who saw me for who I was.\n\n\\-Gabriel: This is my birth first name. I’ve decided to keep it. To me, it honors my past and the person I had to be to survive. It’s an acknowledgment of where I came from, for better and worse.\n\n\\-The Hyphen in Jupiter-Gabriel: This is the core of it for me. By hyphenating Jupiter-Gabriel, I’ve turned it into one singular first name. It symbolizes the bridge I’ve built from my past (Gabriel) to my present and future (Jupiter). It represents everything I went through to become Jupiter-Gabriel, instead of just Gabriel. They aren’t separate; they’re integrated.\n\n\\-João: This is one of my two birth middle names. I’m not part of any lusophone countries, but as it was my birth middle name, it serves as a secondary connection to my past, (but on my own terms). It’s a piece I choose to carry forward. (Also, I can use João as a shorter nickname if Jupiter-Gabriel is too long to say.) A few friends in my life have already called me João instead of Gabriel. So it wouldn’t feel new in a bad way.\n\n\\-Phoenix: My new last name. This one is pretty straightforward but powerful. It represents rebirth, rising from the ashes, and building a new life that is entirely my own.\n\nSo, the full name tells a story: from Gabriel, through the bridge of my experiences and my uncle’s love, to Jupiter, carrying a piece of my past (João), and rising into a new family of my own making (Phoenix).\n\nI know it’s long and sounds like a “character name.” I’m prepared for bureaucratic sighs and having to spell it out. But for me, it’s a daily affirmation of survival and self-creation. I have experimented with introducing myself as both João and Jupiter-Gabriel and they feel more like “me” than any other name I’ve thought of. It feels natural and right. I also feel quite confident being called João or Jupiter-Gabriel.\n\nMy question is: Should I go for it? Has anyone else chosen a highly symbolic, unconventional name after a major life change? How has it been for you practically and emotionally?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would be really appreciated.

I do have autism, so possibly it could be burnout.", "text": "So, my friend sat me down and told me he's worried about me. He said I seem depressed and that I should talk to someone. I brushed it off at first, but now I'm just sitting in my room and wondering if he has a point.\n\nHere’s what my life looks like right now:\n\n\\-I’m basically a hermit in my apartment. All lights off, either watching YouTube or grinding video games.\n\n\\-I sleep an absurd amount: like 10-12 hours, and still wake up feeling completely drained.\n\n\\-My apartment is a disaster zone. I just can't muster the energy to clean.\n\n\\-Work is falling apart. I’m struggling hard with tasks I used to handle easily. Also, work is literally the only time I ever get out.\n\n\\-I've even started hating my job, which is the worst part. I wait tables at a small diner and I used to find genuine happiness in it: the regulars, the rhythm, the sense of purpose. I wanted to make a career out of it. Now, the noise, the demands, the constant interaction… it completely overstimulates me. I can’t focus, I get irritable, and I’m beginning to dread the one place that used to feel good.\n\n\\-The weirdest part? I don’t feel “sad” or “hopeless” in a classic way. I just feel... nothing. Completely dissociated, \"out of it,\" and overwhelmed by the thought of doing pretty much anything. Getting out of bed feels like a monumental task. I also don’t eat hardly ever, not out of discipline, but because I just have zero appetite. Food feels like a chore.\n\n\\-Logically, I should be in panic mode about my job performance. I know I need to work to survive in this capitalist hellscape, but I just... don't give a shit. And that lack of caring is freaking me out more than anything.\n\nAdding another layer to this fog is a huge, looming task I can’t seem to tackle. I’ve been planning to escape my abusive family and cut ties for a long time now. It’s a non-negotiable for my long-term wellbeing. I’ll get right to the edge: plan it all out, look at plane tickets, and then my brain just... stalls. I think, “Oh, I’ll give them one more chance to change,” or some other excuse that doesn’t even sound convincing to me. It’s like my own brain is sabotaging me, protecting a toxic familiarity because the energy required to break free. The planning, the emotional severance, the unknown, feels utterly impossible right now. So I stay stuck, knowing exactly what I need to do for myself, but completely powerless to do it.\n\nHas anyone else experienced depression like this? Not as sadness, but as complete numbness, exhaustion, and detachment? Did getting help actually... help? I feel stuck in a fog that’s ruining my present and keeping me from building a future. I still feel normal emotions if I see something funny I’ll laugh.

Can relate to the food issues, at one point I had to use mechanical eating to make sure I got nutrients because all food tasted bad and I was never hungry. But I got through it and after a job change, exercise, and lots of counseling I have hope again.\n\nAs hard as it can be to change your routine, you might find at least some success in that. Treat yourself to some new experiences (highly recommend exercise!), or even old familiar ones you haven't tried in a while. It's hard, almost impossible in this state, but sometimes forcing yourself to do things that are uncomfortable at first may be worth it later. Or not, it depends on the person, for some it is unbearable and that's okay! It depends on your needs of course.\n\nAt least find someone you are comfortable talking to, someone safe like a friend or counselor, who you can open up to and really get into stuff. Even a hotline if you need.  It will take time but you have to believe you will get better, and start contributing time to things that work for you, whatever that looks like.\n\nAlso it sounds like you are sleeping too much maybe, maybe try 8 hours and see if that helps with lethargy, when I oversleep that much I feel terribly drained the next day for whatever reason (unless my body needs it). \n\nAll the best, you WILL get through this!!", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767921713.0, "id": "nyih1ez", "author": "Code-Useful"}

Depression is like.... imagine you have a \"fun\" level (1 to 10), and a \"miserable\" level (-10 to 0). Depression means your fun level is permanently capped at around a 1; Even occasions that *should* have you feel *great* for a decent amount of time may have you spike up to a 5 or so for a few minutes, but you'll be back to at a 1 at best within minutes. And even then you often do not feel *good*, you feel *relief*.\n\nThat's what depression actually means, by the way: \"Pressured downward\". It doesn't mean you always are stuck at a -9 or so, it just means you can't really go above 1 any more.\n\nThe rest of your description (oversleeping, lack of drive/motivation, mental fog, etc.) also are classic symptoms of depression.\n\n&gt; Am I depressed or is this something else entirely? \n\nNo health expert, and no doing diagnoses anyway, but the way you describe reads as basically textbook depression (plus, autism and depression, highly correlated, probably often causative).

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "If you're unable to split chores 50/50 then you have few options:\n\n\\- Finding your strengths and weaknesses. Let's say cooking takes a huge toll on you but you don't mind cleaning afterwards and doing all the planning and grocery shopping: you might never cook the meal itself but the whole thing doesn't fall onto your wife's shoulders. Or, like I do with my partner, I do the actual cooking and they do the cutting. They don't like staying in front of a pan and I don't like getting my hands dirty (literally) so it works out pretty well. You can share chores according to your limits and abilities.\n\n\\- \"Working\" on preventing yourself from reaching the point where you're burntout and overwhelmed, and thus unable to do the chores. This is easier said than done, and would work better with the help of a therapist but you need to ask yourself how and why you get to these states. For instance if you feel overwhelmed doing the dishes, what is it about them? Is it sensory issues? Gloves are good for that, only using hot water also. Is it standing above the sink for a while? You can get a stool and take breaks. Try and find out exactly what prevents you from doing the task, and see if some simple steps might work to help with that. It's much easier to do chores when you have tools to help you with them.\n\n\\- Looking for any sort of help you might qualify for, so you might get a better situation whether it's money or job wise. With more money you can save up and leave if you wish to (or hire help/buy tools to compensate for what you can't do), with a more accommodating job you might have more energy and be less prone to burnout. I don't know where you live so I don't know what kind of resources you could get but if you're struggling and you have an official diagnosis you could qualify for some things.\n\n  \nAgain it's not easy but only you can find out how to bridge the gap between what you can do and what is expected of you.

I only realised I’m autistic a few months ago after years of thinking I had depression. I’m currently waiting for autism and ADHD assessments, but I’m very confident autism is the main thing affecting my life.\n\nFor the past 5 years I’ve worked in extremely stressful, customer‑facing jobs (mainly restaurants). Throughout that time I’ve had repeated mental breakdowns every few months, which have been getting worse over time. In the lead‑up to a breakdown I cry at work, have panic attacks, severe anxiety, gut issues, and eventually shut down and can’t communicate. When this happens I’m unable to work and have to take time off. I now understand this pattern as autistic burnout caused by long‑term masking and sensory overload.\n\nI currently live with my partner and two other people. It’s not their fault, but because I’m in constant burnout, everyday noise, smells, and changes to routine overwhelm me and can trigger meltdowns that write off my entire day. I feel like I need my own living space in order to recover, regulate myself, and feel safe. However, I can’t afford to move out because I can’t work full time without becoming severely unwell and suicidal.\n\nI don’t know what kind of jobs I should even apply for anymore. I’m scared of putting myself into another situation that will cause another breakdown. I do have skills (especially cooking and art), but right now I’m struggling to keep up with even basic daily tasks, which makes everything feel impossible.\n\nLately I feel like I’m stuck in a long grey period. I sometimes feel like I’m condemned to a miserable life, but I know that’s my depression talking. I don’t feel like myself anymore, and I’m scared my old, happy, creative self is gone for good. I feel like my life is passing me by while I’m stuck just trying to survive.\n\nI’m really looking for reassurance and lived experience from others who were late‑diagnosed, went through autistic burnout, or felt completely stuck like this — and did eventually find a way to rebuild their life in a way that worked for them. Did things get better for you? Were you able to recover, find suitable work, or create a life that felt manageable and meaningful again?\n\nAny advice or shared experiences would really mean a lot right now.

For example, I have a stash of paper cranes on my work desk, but I \"euthanize\" my cranes in the recycling bin every time the desk gets too cluttered. To me, this feels like a controlled burn that is used to reduce the risk of a catastrophic fire disaster occuring, which in this case would be like a janitor discarding a mountain of my cranes without my consent. \n\nI am definitely still looking for balance, though. I still haven't repurchased my favorite kitchen utensils since the fire happened a year ago, and have been living with only a spoon, a pair of chopsticks, and a metal pot. I don't have any forks, bowls, plates, pans, spatulas, etc, because I don't want to have things to get attached to that I may lose in a painful way someday. By refusing to own things that I would get attached to, I essentially don't have the risk of becoming devastated if I am forced to not have those things anymore. Additionally, the things that I do have, such as my spoon and pot, are not my preferred type or ones that bring me joy, so I would be fine with losing them if needed. I definitely do not recommend this extreme approach, because I literally don't feel much happiness anymore. Although I don't have attachment to much that would be distressing to lose, I also have no prized possessions. \n\nI think that if you can systematically go through your shoe collection and maybe give each pair a ranking for how important they are to you, you can confidently condense your collection a bit to have reduced clutter, but also still keep your favorite pairs.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767987089.0, "id": "nyni4kw", "author": "Suspicious_Oil_2518"}

Well for my drama class we got to watch the year 11's perform it for a grade, and while I'm happy I didn't have to do work for that class I think this was worse.\n\nThe teacher answered some questions, like how the main character was supposed to be autistic (if you don't know the author didn't do any research on autism for this book, so it might be realistic for some but for a majority I don't think as so. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) and how it would help us understand it better. I've been diagnosed at this point in time and I'm looking forward to basically skipping a class.\n\nThrough the play my smile dropped. The kid was rolling back and forth, breathing so loud I can hear him from the back of the theatre and clutching at soundproof headphones the room from the LEC. At several points he pretended to cry during these breakdowns. Keep in mind this is one of the only ways these children will bother to learn about autism. Quiet frankly they will grow up believing that autistic people are unable to do anything unless extremely prompted.\n\n**THAt'S NOT ALL THOUGH!!**\n\nWhen we go back to the class the teacher asks for feedback for the 11's and I say \"I don't like how stereotypical it was\" which brought a five minute rant about how it has several awards for its accurate autism description ( because clearly autism isn't a spectrum) and how I am so horribly wrong.\n\nNow we go around a couple more people and this is were it gets good folks. Now a classmate that I'm just gonna call James says \" I actually really like the stereotypes! \". And I promise I am not lying about this, nearly the entire class bursts into laughter INCLUDING THE TEACHER. And I just sit there waiting for them to stop giggling. I saw some of my classmates start crying from there laughter, knowing I was the butt of the joke. some of my closest friends where also laughing.\n\nIt's worse since I have been accused of racism at that same school( I had been struggling with bullying for a long while and got shoved and told I looked like a VERY different looking girl and I pointed out I looked nothing like her. She was from African decent, I am not racist and have never been but I thought some context would help) and I had gotten death threats as well as many more people harrasing me. No one was ever punished.\n\nIts been a couple years since then and I'm supposed to take my GCSE' s soon, but I haven't gone to school in a while. The only school I can go to is my current one without horrible wake up times or banning of stimming tools. I just needed to rant for a bit.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I think traits are harder to navigate if the skill hasn't been learned on how to manage them.\n\nOne of the most common traits from ASD is fine motor skills. Now let's use tying your shoes, for example. People can technically tie their shoes. Whether it holds is how it's made, right? So, doing the \"right way\" kind of matters because you want your knot to hold so you don't trip on your laces. So let's say the shoe doesn't hold the knot. Do you then learn the skill? Learn how to tie the knot correctly? or do you get slip ones? Let's say you get slip ons. You can tie your shoes, just not well. That last time you tied your shoe was how far the skill went because you transitioned to slip ons. Fast forward, you age, and you say, I want to wear sneakers. That skill is going to be where you left it, beginner level. You didn't technically learn it and went with a different solution. It doesn't mean you can't do it, but would you think you regressed? I would. Because it's not going to be something I think about, tying shoes becomes a muscle memory at one point, and when you do it, it requires minimum to zero thought. I'll think, \"I must be regressing because I can't tie my shoes anymore\" when I never really learned how to tie them in the first place. \nAnd unfortunately, age brings another barrier. Mobility issues are huge in the elderly communities. Maybe you have arthritis in your hands, and it's too painful to bother with laces. Some things we don't even get to entertain if it was regression or not. \n\nAnyways, that's just how I look at it. I used to think I regressed, but when I thought about the things I actually learned vs. getting by and appearing to have a skill I don't have.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I do not know your specific case but there are some things we can talk about with regard to age, which can make your autism more visible or make it seem \"worse.\" All very interesting, but also very multifaceted and I can only give a short resume of each point to produce a somewhat readable comment. \n\n- As we age the world demand more and more from us. When we move out from our parents house as young adults we have to take care of more practical aspects of life, cleaning, cooking, maintaining our space. When we have kids (if we choose to do so) it can be more demanding of our regulation of emotions, we get less sleep our needs are often not prioritised the same way ect.. Romantic partnerships, and relationships also has to be maintained and care for which falls more on the individual as we age. Not to mention jobs, bills ect. All of these are things everyone struggles with but for autistic people some can be the one to send us over an edge, as we are more prone to stress, emotional pressure ect. \n\n- Our social support can fall away as we age. Our parents may grow old, get sick and ultimately die. Our friends may have kids, jobs of their own and lives which also demands much of them. Not to mention that (especially western) society pushes individualism and expects adults to stand more and more on their own feet, which can make asking for help more vulnerable and ultimately mean help can be harder to get. These factors can lessen the support we get from trusted people. \n\n- Personality wise we also change as we age. Generally speaking we (humans) grow less open to change as we age, we become more set in our ways.* Assuming that is correct for autistic people as well, who are already prone to be set in their rutines, I could imagine this would also be a factor that could worsen the symptomology. \n\n- Lastly, trauma can also heavily impact the autistic expression and the level of symptoms. Trauma related illnesses such as PTSD, CPTSD and personality disorders are viewed as differential diagnoses. Which means that when they examine a person for autism they should also have some attention to ruling out trauma related issues. The symptomology of these diagnoses and autism can mimic eachother. Assuming that trauma can look somewhat like autism, we can also assume that autism + trauma can *look like* autism + autism. Which we can feel as worse autism symptoms. \n\nIf you are experiencing worse symptoms it could be worth a while to reflect on if anything could be causing it, and to contact your physician or a mental health professional if it continues over a longer period or if you are worried. Rather a call too many than too few. \n\nAutistic people are more prone to stress, depression and anxiety and as people living the autistic experience we have to be a bit more aware of our mental health. It is a hassle, but it is better to take action than let it fester. \n\nIf any of you have questions with regards to what I have written here, please feel free to ask. I should also be able to provide sources if such is wanted. It is just a bit of a chore doing so on my phone and I would rather not bother if it is not needed. \n\n*(Note: not speaking anecdotally here, it's been measured with the OCEAN model of personality traits - also known as the big five personality test).", "score": 6, "created_utc": 1767884782.0, "id": "nyeqjie", "author": "OceanBlueSeaTurtle"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "There is no one formula. Each person has their own \"ruleset\", some things will overlap, but not everyrhing.\n\n\nSome people can see/feel that you are a people pleaser and aren't genuine. So they might subconsciously exclude you because there is no \"you\" - like, you are a mirror instead of another person. Oftentimes people notice discrepancies of people pleasers, like, they say that thry like the band, but then are sour during the whole concert or one day they hear you say that X is the best thing ever, while a few days later they hear you say that X is the worst thing ever.. The lack of stability can be a turn off. A lot of harmony hinges on predictability.\n\n\nAnd there is a difference between behaving a bit different based on your surrounding and changing yourself completely. Normally you just show a different facet of yourself while retaining your core, while people pleasers (and maybe social chameleons) change themselves fully.\n\n\nSo stop pretending to be someone else or do thing because the other likes it. Be you and do things that you like and find people who like the same thing. Instead of changing yourself for others - find people who accept you.\n\n\nStop people pleasing and \"grow a spine\". Healthy people want to interact with you and tend to have lower tolerance for people who do stuff only to please them.\n\n\nOh, and sometimes the hate and frustration of people pleasers when they notice that the people pleasing is not working can be subconsciously noticed and thus people try to avoid that person.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767958123.0, "id": "nyku5hw", "author": "Siukslinis_acc"}

It's been over 2.5 years and I don't experience paranoia at all anymore, my OCD symptoms are significantly more manageable, I haven't had what was labeled as a manic episode (it used to be super frequent) or a depressive episode, and my crazy mood swings are gone. I've been able to hold a job for the first time and can finally actually take care of myself. The psychiatrist who diagnosed me with bipolar told me that he admits that he was wrong. I don't know if medication was the origin of the psychosis (the psychosis came 3 years after I started other meds), but it definitely prolonged the time period I suffered for.\n\nNot saying that meds are bad for everyone, there are many people who benefit from them. But the mentality that \"you just need to keep trying new ones indefinitely\" isn't always beneficial, because it can keep people like me from finding the right thing for their own brains and bodies.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "I don't think it is an autism thing. It happens to a lot of people on antidepressants. It is one of the reasons that I have no plans to take them. Most antidepressants are SSRIs, which block the re-uptake of serotonin. This leads to increased levels of serotonin in the synapses, particularly when the pre-synaptic (releasing neuron) 5-HT2A receptors that regulate serotonin release become downregulated/desensitized. However, they also downregulate post-synaptic (receiving end) 5-HT2A receptors. They functionally increase 5-HT1A receptor activity. 5-HT1A receptors are most strongly in the amygdala, where it regulates something called \"passive coping\" (ie. caring less). The increase in activity at 5-HT2C receptors may suppress dopamine release in parts of the brain, leading to motivational problems. 5-HT2A receptors are expressed more throughout the cortex and they regulate cognition, stress, mental flexibility, behavior, and mood. Their downregulation decreases something called \"active coping\", which is where a person pushes through stress  by adapting to cope with a situation. SSRIs decrease this. 5-HT2A agonists like LSD or psilocybin are known for promoting more active coping, hence being investigated as a potential treatment for depression.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767839500.0, "id": "nybosys", "author": "Ok_Nectarine_8612"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "autism", "title": "Im scared of losing my brother", "text": "This is my cry for help because I do not know what to do anymore.\n\nMy little brother is diagnosed with autism, ADHD, OCD, and depression. Ever since he started high school, his depression has gotten so much worse. During the first semester of freshman year, he was doing well academically and had straight As. During that time, my brother did tell me he hated doing schoolwork because it made him feel stupid when he didn’t understand it, which made no sense to me because his grades were amazing. I knew he was smart and could see how much potential he had, so I was hard on him about maintaining good grades.\n\nI didn't know the severity of how he felt until I got a call from my mom that my brother tried to cut himself at school and that he had written a suicide note on his essay. The school sent him to a mental hospital, and that’s is when everything changed. After he got out, I knew about his suicidal thoughts and how bad his depression really was, but I don’t think it fully hit me until more time passed. \n\nNow he has completely stopped trying at school. He does no work at all, to the point that some teachers have stopped giving him assignments. He tells us how going to school feels like torture. He says it is incredibly boring and that he hates being there. He dreads waking up knowing he has school and has told us he would rather be dead than go to school.\n\nI try to ask him what exactly bothers him, but he does not open up. It is tough to get him to go deeper into his feelings, and I think part of it is that he does not even understand them himself, which only frustrates him more. I keep wondering if his ADHD makes learning harder for him, and seeing everyone else understand things makes him feel stupid, so he just gave up completely, even when he was getting straight As.\n\nI asked him what he does all day if he is not doing schoolwork, and he said nothing. I told him that, yeah, his days DO sound boring ass hell… it would feel like torture to me too if I did absolutely nothing all day. I told him school would probably go faster and feel better if he at least tried to listen or do some work. At least doing SOMETHING would be more entertaining than doing NOTHING. He doesn’t even care about his grades anymore so what does he have to loose. \n\nI imagine every day for him to feel like the first day of school when you don’t do anything at all and just have to hear the teacher yap yap yap for 7 hours.\n\nI think I also made things worse when I tried to motivate him by talking about his future. I asked him what he wanted to do and what it would take to get there. Maybe a high school diploma or a college degree. I thought it would help, but instead, he told me he has no motivation or goals, and I think it just made him feel worse. Yes I know how stupid that was now since many people his age don’t know what their future could look like, but I was just desperate in finding an attempt to motivate him to do school work. I’ve told him that he doesn’t have to finish school if he doesn’t want to, that he could get his GED if he one day regrets not getting his high school diploma but we cant drop him out of school until he’s 17 by law. \n\nWe constantly get calls from the school asking what to do. We tell them the same thing every time. Yes, he is in therapy. Yes, he is on medication. Yes, he has suicidal thoughts. Yes, we are trying everything we can to get him to do his work. They told us he could do online classes that are self-paced, but everyone in my house works, and I have two jobs and go to university, so we won’t have someone to monitor him while he’s doing online school. Especially given his attempts, none of us wants to leave him alone. My brother also told us that online school would be better, but he still won’t do his schoolwork. \n\nSo I guess my question is how do I help out my brother? has anyone have to deal with something similar to what my brother is going through ? \n", "score": 43, "num_comments": 41, "created_utc": 1767885875.0, "id": "1q7embx", "author": "Internal-Job8493", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1q7embx/im_scared_of_losing_my_brother/"}

Social conflicts competing in the background of the mind with personal needs, idle thoughts about daily tasks needing to be done, personal interests. All swirling around with some person poking at your mind with non sense words further distracting the mind already trying to reconcile an unsolvable problem.\n\nThe problem isnt encouragement or any other thing. It is people. Simply giving them space and a better enviorment can help. However alternative forms of educating isnt usually practical for most families.\n\nThe only real form of help for them is giving them their space and general monitoring of their mindset from afar. Being generally grumpy gloomy side is normal. They are just likely burnt out. For me this mostly went away after high school ended. \n\nOffering to talk about them and how they are doing is usually fine but dont force it if they reject socializing which op's brother has already done. Maybe a therpist could help. However forcing one sided aid,  encouragement, or prying too much could add unwanted social pressure and cause feelings of entrapment and cause a crisis. Remember social pressure aka people is the cause of the problem.\n\nBy forcing instead of mutually engaging you become a trigger for distress. Its literally how my whole crisis in my teens happened.\n\nKeeping people from bothering them should generally be priority #1.

Please get more educated on certain topics because he may benefit from the approaches outlined to help these topics if that makes sense? (Sometimes I am wordy please let me know if I do not make sense.) not saying you don’t know anything but I have no way of knowing so trying to cover some bases lol. :) \n\nPlease look into Alexithymia. Very common with adhd and autism. \n\n“Alexithymia is a personality trait marked by difficulty identifying, understanding, and describing one's own emotions.”\n\nPlease look into autistic burnout. Not regular. Autistic. If his demands from school and home do not lessen by a lot I worry for your brother. Is there a neurodivergent therapist he can work with? \n\nPlease look into monotropism and hyperfixation. The way I worked in school is everything that didn’t fit within my special interest or current fixations were like torture to participate in. Can he get some leeway at school to do similar assignments about topics he likes but related to the school topic? For example if he had to write an essay demonstrating he understood the similes and analogies in a piece of text maybe he could select a text piece he has a special interest in like for example for me it would be history or LOTR or something. \n\n“Monotropism is a cognitive processing style that involves intense focus on a limited number of interests, often to the exclusion of surrounding stimuli.”\n\nThe things that have helped me are radical acceptance. If you do think this could help, Yall as a family can start practicing and modeling that about YOURSELVES around him. Not forcing him to participate or adopt it because he may have a PDA style nervous system and forcing it will make it worse. If you are unfamiliar please look into PDA/pathological demand avoidance/ personal drive for autonomy some call it. \n\nAlso I quit functioning even basic care for myself for TWO YEARS. Slowing down and doing nothing but hobbies and rebuilding myself and therapy (yes I recognize my privilege) is what helped me the most. And understanding myself. \n\nOur brains often don’t view things like hey you need a degree to get this job. It’s often oh god I feel like this now and can’t imagine not feeling like this…you say HOW many more years? Learning a new culture and way of schooling (college is vastly different than primary school). Leaving friends. Possibly leaving family. FAFSA headache. Paying for it. State of the world. Politics. I know you meant well and I’m not dogging on you. Trying to give perspective for how the thoughts may be manifesting for him just based on my own experiences.

And further action with him may harm him not like ignore him but the things you’ve actively tried haven’t helped, but this could channel some of that energy into learning more about him and maybe other support strategies from these topics (which awesome job reaching out btw and starting somewhere. A lot of good autism resources on Reddit in my experience as well.) \n\nI apologize I do not have the spoons (spoon theory to measure energy/ability level day by day) to go super in depth but hope these topics and looking into them helps 🖤 \n\nI wish you and your family and your brother the best.

But maybe some low stakes PDA style adjustments could help ease some stress from him. \n\nAnd as someone else mentioned the whole family needs to stop putting their expectations and stress on him. It feels like he may have issues around shame etc based on the not wanting to feel stupid etc. And even though well meaning the environment often helps shape that. Doesn’t even have to be mean, it can be others not reacting well when they are wrong themselves.

The brain does not know the difference between actual reality and imagine. If you imagine you had an argument your brain doesn’t know the anxiety you felt was from a fake “threat.” It goes, oh man a threat! React! \n\n(There’s a form of OCD that is largely internal and I didn’t even know it affected myself!

I would recommend that you and your family also attend therapy. He’s not trying to hurt you, but this is extremely traumatic, and most of us on the more “normal” end of the spectrum are unable to sympathize or even empathize appropriately, even when we think we are, we really aren’t. \n\nIt took years for me to finally empathize and sympathize my husband’s struggles appropriately, and I don’t even do it well a lot of the time. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, and sometimes still do (we aren’t perfect). A person like your brother (and like my husband) know for absolute certain, there isn’t any gold at the end of the rainbow. He also knows the more we tell them there is, the more we are lying to him. As a result, he trusts us less. \n\nTherapy for me has been helpful in identifying the moments where I have to bite the bullet and not “force” my help upon him with pseudo-positive platitudes and motivation, but to just be present and supportive. \nLately my husband has been extremely suicide leaning due to the current state of affairs in the US (where we live). To be honest, a lot of it is hard for me too. It’s impossible for me to provide love and support in traditional ways in those moments. Being present and validating is the key, but I will never validate his desires to be dead, and that’s where I still struggle today. It affects me in a way that breaks me in 2. My traumas and neuro-spicy behaviors come out to play. -it’s not an excuse, but I’m only human too. \n\nWe can’t do this alone and therapy for everyone is a great start. Not group therapy! I’m sure he’d hate that. However, taking a vested interest in his disability and taking proactive measures to ensure that you only want to understand and love him in a way he can truly understand may go a long way. A lot of my husband’s traumas stem from him being a 90s kid with extra religious parents who viewed things like autism as a punishment from god. His entire life he was called a baby, dramatic, extra, etc Completely invalidating his thoughts and feelings. He was forced to mask, and that caught up with him around his 30s when actual attempts on his life were made and many bridges were burned. \n\nYour brother should not be encouraged to mask, but he needs to be validated. It sounds like you’re already doing that, and that’s an amazing start. He’s still young enough to hopefully benefit from it. I think more neurodivergent people can attest to the fact that they’ve been given some serious trauma at the hands of people they are supposed to trust to keep them safe. Sometimes those people don’t mean to cause harm, but unfortunately some of them do. \n\nI’ve never been diagnosed, I’m pretty sure I’m on the spectrum someplace, but for arguments sake let’s just say I’m neuro-typical. There are a lot of mistakes I still make and there are a lot of times where I’m genuinely confused and don’t understand what I did wrong. It’s important for me to remember that he doesn’t truly believe I’m a monster and is just struggling with my struggles to understand him. Therapy helps me a lot with that. \n\nWe can’t “fix” them. There’s nothing to fix, they’re perfect in their own way and beautiful souls at that. The high sense of justice thing is annoying sometimes, but it comes from this beautiful place of real compassion and empathy that a lot of us don’t possess. (Or at least no one their same level) \n\nIt’s not solid advice but, when you talk to him about his struggles, try not to offer solutions. Those solutions are solutions that would benefit us. We’re only looking at the big picture, when there’s a smaller, much more intricate enchanting picture right in front of us. Open the conversation in a way where he gets to talk. What does he want? What isn’t working for him? What can we do to address what’s not working? Remind him that he isn’t a burden, because he isn’t. Remind him that you love him and support him. Remind him that even though there are things you don’t understand it isn’t because you don’t want to. Of course remind him that it’s okay if he can’t answer any of those questions in the moment. You’ll be there for him when he’s ready. That works sometimes for me. It truly depends on my mood though.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "Well I laughed at first and got a second opinion without ever disclosing it to them but when that ended with the same outcome I was enraged and completely ignored it for 13 years!\n\nI’ve only accepted this since I was diagnosed again for a third time in September but this time also with ADHD. It’s… it’s a lot to take in. Acceptance will take me years no doubt and there are days where I feel broken and this is reinforced with every social encounter where I finally understand why I feel this magnetic repulsion to other people that just don’t seem to speak the same language as me. However there are also days where I realize I just experience the world differently and that’s ok!\n\nSupport for adults is so hard to find so researching all of this to understand what my autism and ADHD are like is really the most important step because no two people with either/both of these things present the same. You can’t find coping strategies for your struggles and sources of overwhelm until you figure out what they are and learning what is and isn’t from my autism has allowed me to make changes for the better.\n\nI recommend finding an affirming therapist, preferably with lived experiences as they would be better suited to helping you navigate this because it really is a lot to take in. \n\nAlso, the book Self Care for Autistic People was truly enlightening and really helped put things into perspective and gave me recommendations to start trying which some showed immediate results. It helped me start to feel less broken and upset about all of this realizing that I can use this to improve my life instead of sulk about it.\n\nThe biggest mistake I made was disclosing this to some people… I never plan to disclose this to work unless I need an accommodation that I can’t explain any other way, but people do not understand what this is. It is highly likely you will be gaslit, invalidate, told that you don’t “look autistic” whatever that’s supposed to look like. At one point it all just made sense and it’s like my life finally locked into focus and everything made sense finally, all my social struggles and how I would act or react to the environment compared to other people. It finally made sense and I wanted some people that I trusted to know that it brought me a sense of relief only to discover they do not share this sentiment. \n\nSo Make sure you research a lot and understand what struggles your autism brings for you so you are prepared for this and other questions. Even for those that are accepting and/or that try to be understanding disclosing is an anxiety inducing nightmare that takes a L O T to do and once the questions start I am drained and not prepared for that at all. It’s ok to ask to take a break and come back to it later so you can process things.\n\nJust know that you are not broken you just experience the world differently and that’s OK! There may be struggles that absolutely make things so much harder but it’s not your fault, it’s not because you are not “trying hard enough”, we just have to approach problems differently than others.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "For me it wasn’t a moment of relief or instant clarity, and it definitely wasn’t a clean aha realisation. It was more like a slow, slightly unsettling realisation that something I had always treated as character traits, coping strategies, or just “how I work” suddenly had a different explanatory frame.\n\nI wasn’t looking for an excuse or a new identity. I was trying to understand very specific patterns: why certain environments drained me disproportionately, why misunderstandings kept recurring in close relationships despite a lot of effort and reflection, why I could function extremely well in some contexts and completely fall apart in others. Anxiety disorders and depression never really explained that properly, even when they were kind of projected onto me by others. Even my therapists diagnosed me with a panic disorder, even though I always told them I don’t have any fear of certain situations, I just have a physical overload reaction. \n\nThe diagnosis didn’t feel false, but it also didn’t feel immediately intuitive, because a lot of my adaptation had already been internalised. High masking, strong cognitive compensation, and being very analytical about my own behaviour meant that nothing looked “obviously autistic” from the outside, and honestly not from the inside either. What shifted things wasn’t the label itself, but learning about the actual ASD long-term patterns and see them line up in a way that finally made sense. Before that, I was very much unaware of ASD and did not understand what it really is/can be and I had the usual stereotypes of people with autism. Although I met a few autistic people before and had a positively unsettling feeling to really get along. \n\nI spent a lot of time questioning the diagnosis rather than accepting it emotionally. I wanted to understand why this framework fit better than others, where its limits were, and what it actually explained versus what it didn’t. Over time, what mattered most wasn’t whether I felt autistic in some identity sense, but that the model reduced self-blame and explained costs I had previously ignored or normalised.\n\nSo if you’re unsure right now, that doesn’t mean anything is wrong. Doubt, resistance, or even irritation can be part of a very rational processing phase. You don’t have to “feel” diagnosed for it to be useful. For me, the diagnosis only became meaningful once it proved itself by clarifying things that had been structurally confusing for years.

Personally, I’ve been entrusted with my little ones on my own multiple times and succeeded.\n\nThen there’s the elephant in the room: actually parenting. That, and feeling like the only real adult in the room. My then-NT-wife and her family would spend hours on end playing mindless overstimulating television and video games in front of the kids, which would make them crabby when a show ended or when someone offered to have fun outside. I, on the other hand, gave the kiddos ample opportunities to turn the gadgets off and play with each other, their toys, and their own imaginations, and boy were they well-behaved during “Daddy time”. To this day, my little ones are adjusting well to their Daddy’s clear rules, firm discipline, engaging playtime, and overall structure, which every allistic person I know clearly lacks.\n\nFor those who prefer not to have kids due to sensory struggles, I totally understand. It’s your brain; you don’t need to have a kid if children are your sensory ouch. For those who despise other people’s kids but want to start a family themselves, may I suggest a strong parental moral code. Keep in mind that this is more than putting your kids in the Time-Out corner if they don’t behave or if they scream until your ears bleed. It’s about giving their growing brains room to breathe.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "autism", "text": "My sensory issues have worsened significantly after having a child.\n\nI don’t mind diapers, poop, snot, or general grossness that comes with young children, but my nervous system cannot handle the noise.  Babies crying?  Fine, no problem.  Toddlers making random repetitive noises?  I want to rip my hair out.  I’ve never worn noise cancelling headphones until my child turned 3, and now I wear them almost daily.\n\nI’m lucky I have support and accommodations to make things easier, but parenting is ridiculously hard for me.  I’ve done some pretty hard things in my life and been in many difficult and stressful situations, but parenting a toddler has to be one of the worst.  I love my son so much and I try to be the best parent I can be for him but it’s such a shock to my system.  \n\nThere are good days and bad, but overall, having him has been a net positive in my life.  Yes, my sensory issues got worse, but my executive functioning improved astronomically.  My time management is excellent.  My routines are solid.  My domestic skills are top notch.  My sleep, diet, and health have improved significantly.  I’m actually less depressed and anxious, and generally happier than I’ve ever been in my life.  I didn’t know I was autistic until after I had a child, and I don’t know if I would have ever known if it wasn’t for that.\n\nIt’s difficult to know how you’ll take to parenting until you have a child, since personalities, temperaments, and situations are so vastly different.  If you do decide to have kids, make sure you have support and accommodations, preferably ones that understand your struggles and allow you a decent amount of rest time.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767993803.0, "id": "nyo6bbg", "author": "2cats4fish"}
