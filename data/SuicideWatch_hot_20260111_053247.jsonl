{"type": "post", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "title": "New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement", "text": "We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  \n\nWe've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an \"innocent\" message like \"if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace\" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). \n\nWe deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  \n\nPlease report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the \"report\" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. \n\nThanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.  \n    \n    \n\n******\n***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  \n*******\n\n###Summary###\n\n**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** \n\n###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###\n\nWe're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  \n\nBut there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**\n\nAnything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. \n\nDo not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  \n\nIn [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. \n\n**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something \"innocent\" like \"I hope you find peace\", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  \n\n###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###\n\nKeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  \n\n* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular \"good\" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that \"it's not so bad\", and this is usually experienced as \"I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try\".  People who've had \"help\" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   \n\n*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. \n\n* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the \"it gets better\" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. \n\n* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.\n\nTo avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.\n\n###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###\n\nOften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  \n\nThey will typically try to scratch their psychological \"itch\" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:\n\n* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than \"brutally forcing someone to stay alive\" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.\n\n* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of \"solidarity\" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  \n\nMany suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: \n\n* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (\"Don't do it!\"), cheerleading (\"You've got this!\") or meaningless false promises (\"Trust me, it gets better!\"), or invalidation (\"Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!\").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)\n\n* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  \n\nPlease [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "text": "Huh. I think I've broken the rules. I agree with a lot of this and appreciate the research put into it but I think this misses the mark in a couple places. Why would someone come to a subreddit for suicidal people to talk about their suicide, and actively avoid the more squishy, positivity oriented spaces that exist?\n\n1. To share their final thoughts with anyone they can.\n\n2. To explore the ideations of other suicidals, likely because they're not entirely convinced yet and still debating it.\n\n3. To empathize or find empathy with other people feeling the same way.\n\nNot to be blatantly talked out of it. Strangers trying to fix your depression is annoying af. And the fact that people only passively want you to stay alive for their own personal peace of mind but don't actually give a shit about you beyond that is usually a factor in what has led them to this point to begin with.\n\nNot only do I think there's nothing wrong with talking to someone about suicide while explicitly reassuring them that you're not interested in stopping them from doing it. I think that approaching someone who has made up their mind as though they're a fully functional adult who has likely put sufficient consideration into their decisions and doesn't owe you an explanation or opportunity to debate their reasoning can disarm the apprehension towards apathetic virtue signaling and allow said suicide risk's mind a bit of ease and relaxation that can be vital in one last critical analysis of their decisions... Which may well lead to a reconsideration. \n\nIt's ok to just be there for another human being without trying to manipulate them into conforming to some societal standard.\n\nEdit: also a little dark humor goes a long way in some cases.

It's not the way to ease someone's pain or help them feel less alone.  \n\nAnd we have no problem with people sharing their own dark feelings in response to someone's post. That's in no way the same thing as validating someone's suicidal intent.   \n\n&gt;  I think that approaching someone who has made up their mind as though they're a fully functional adult who has likely put sufficient consideration into their decisions and doesn't owe you an explanation or opportunity to debate their reasoning can disarm the apprehension towards apathetic virtue signaling and allow said suicide risk's mind a bit of ease and relaxation that can be vital in one last critical analysis of their decisions...

And, again, where do you think we're saying anything otherwise?\n\nYou don't need to endorse suicidal intent to feel and demonstrate respect for people's ownership of their lives.  I've been part of the training team for a couple thousand suicide hotline responders and the ones who don't do the latter always wash out.  They get emotionally invested in the clients' outcomes and that's toxic AF.  The [PSA post linked from point 4d](http://redd.it/25igd7) in the guidelines (in the sidebar/community info) goes into the perils of outcome-based thinking from a slightly different angle.  \n\nI think you'd probably agree with the training mantra that I use at the hotline:  \"90% of the time, the rapport *is* the solution\".   \n\nQuite a few of our rules that apply to helpers are more strict than they need to be in all cases - but because this is a public support space, there are quite a few things that can work in some cases which are not allowed because we're found that they have an unacceptably high backfire rate. \n\nAnother wrinkle is that we have no reason to think that the 90/10/1 rule doesn't work here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet, and so our responders aren't just speaking to our OPs, and we all need to keep that in mind.  \n\nI do have one point where both we and the science may disagree with you.  You seem imply in a couple of places that there's a \"point of no return\" where someone can't be helped.  It's impossible to prove that that never happens, but the evidence is overwhelming that even the people who act most desperately and violently to try and end their lives can usually be helped.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1578569418.0, "id": "fdmwtpj", "author": "SQLwitch"}

I will venture a guess that it was the remark about an internet comment being blamed for being the deciding factor for someone to kill themselves. If that's the point in question, I'd suggest that I meant quite the opposite. That I don't believe that kind of negative reinforcement (unless prolonged and excessive while being sought after and encouraged by the victim) wields a significant power in the decision making process, but adversely a comment of the same weight can have a real effect in dissuasion. \n\nMy argument was merely that condoning, understanding, and accepting someone's decision to kill themselves- acknowledging that they have thought it through to the fullest extent- can be the catalyst of meaningful assistance in reevaluating options and self-assessing mental state. And the worst outcome of it is at the very least providing some respect and dignity in a person's final moments.\n\nWhereas this seems to suggest that any acknowledgement or approval of someone's decision equates to encouragement. But I may be misreading. If so, the lack of clarity there may be worth addressing. Suicide advocacy is not inherently driven by evil as often as empathy.\n\nAnyways, thank you for responding, and entertaining my confusion.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1578570507.0, "id": "fdmxqdt", "author": "VisforVenom"}

The cited sources help to create a potential inflated perception of this type of behavior. \n\nThe suicide voyeurs and/or fetishists and whatever other labels might apply have had at least 15 subreddits that I personally know about banned by the admins that I know of.  Current the only one with significant traffic that's not banned is quarantined.  (I'm not going to name any of them.)  Some of our mods have infiltrated their communities and active suicide incitement and sabotage of our mission was definitely happening.  More subtle is the pro-suicide \"activism\" that co-opts language from other contexts to legitimise itself and normalises and encourages all sorts of toxic behaviours toward people at risk for suicide. \n\nIt's much bigger issue than you might expect everywhere on the internet, but the anonymous, wide-open nature of reddit's design plus the (not entirely unjustified) reputation of reddit's management for being free speech extremists make it particularly bad here.  \n\nThese people's behaviour is blatantly criminal, but at the current state of our laws regarding online behaviour they're incredibly hard to stop.

It's one thing to respect someone's ownership of their life and their right to end it, and another thing to be content about it when someone is so miserable that it comes down to that.  It's always tragic when someone is brought the point of suicide - whether or not they follow through.  I don't think it's helpful or even excusable to be complacent about these situations.  But we need to deplore the circumstances and support the person.  \n\n&gt; Whereas this seems to suggest that any acknowledgement or approval of someone's decision equates to encouragement.\n\nHow could approval *not* be encouragement?  There's a vital (literally) difference between approval and acceptance, imnsho.  \n\n&gt; Suicide advocacy is not inherently driven by evil as often as empathy.\n\nI don't think that's true in every context. Personally, I wouldn't even call myself anti-suicide.  I'm anti-suffering.  I marched in protests for a woman with ALS who was fighting for the right to die.  And as much as I am the first author of the anti-incitement wiki, I go even harder after the \"helpers\" who invalidate our OPs' feelings and experiences. But I think it's naive to assume that most of the pro-suicide advocacy in the case of despondent suicidalty is benevolent.

I think the ethical line to draw, though, is that it would be unfair for me to make my sadness your problem - and that's what far too many misguided \"helpers\" do.   My default starting hypothesis is that someone has become suicidal because the rest of humanity has comprehensively failed them.  Anyone who's interested in helping needs to in some way make up for that, not ask the person to do anything or suffer any more.  (Of course there are practical complexities, especially in the case of involuntary interventions, which I think are usually -- but not always -- a terrible idea.)  \n\nI have especially intense hate for the mindset behind books like *Stay*, which was all the rage a few years ago.   Its operating assumption is that suicidal people have a responsibility to do a lot of difficult cognitive work to avoid \"damaging humanity\" by their deaths.

The relationship between depression and suicide is correlational, not causal.  Depression doesn't make people suicidal, but some of the same things that contribute to depression also contribute to suicidality.  And although there's a consistent positive correlation between depression and suicidal *thought*, the relationship between depression and suicidal *behaviour* is less clear.  Sometimes the correlation is found to be neutral or even negative.  For example, suicides peak in the spring in both hemispheres, coinciding with the lifting of seasonal depression.\n\nSecond, it's not wise to assume that similar lived experience helps us empathise with others.

But I don't think the standards go nearly far enough, nor do they address the issue of cognitive load on the responders, which I think is probably the largest single cause of responders appearing to be disengaged with callers.  The [IASP also has a helplines best practices special-interest group](https://www.iasp.info/helplines_best_practices.php) in which I participate, which I think will eventually lead to better standards, but I fear that global adoption might be like the metric system, where the Americans stick with their substandard system just because it's theirs.  \n\n&gt; I wonder if suicide encouragers / fetishists are just sadists or are they potentially suicidal or depressive themselves and are projecting those feelings onto others, i.e. vicarious suicide. \n\nI think that both those types of people exist, and in an anonymous text-only context, it can be really tricky to distinguish between them even though one group wants to hurt others and one wants their pain to be understood.  One reason why it's hard is that so many people who are struggling with suicidal despair also have such a low level of emotional literacy that they can't distinguish emotions from beliefs and intentions, so even when they're trying to express their feelings and get them validated, what they actually express is not in the language of feelings at all.  But if their emotional literacy were better, chances are their general mental health would be better as well.  ::sigh:: \n\n&gt;  I wonder if a suicidally oriented or depressive person can be a better communicator with a suicidal person than someone who does not have these feelings as strongly. \n\nAbsolutely.

What if you're a cool warrior trying to survive the harsh forest? Battling the cold, hunger, and loneliness will make you stronger than most people. Imagine there's a greater purpose for you to be going through these trials.. I did this when I had really bad stuff in my life happening to me and in the end it did open some meaning for me for real... Just imagine, maybe you're greater than many people. 🐺⚔️✨🏕️", "score": 8, "created_utc": 1768075836.0, "id": "nyuez62", "author": "Valineris_Phoenix"}

My mom used to yell at me over every tiny thing, I could do everything right and mess up on one thing and she would ground me or yell at me. There were to many moments in my life where my mother would yell at me to the point where I started cutting. She might’ve been the reason why my ocd got bad too idk. She’s a good mom sometimes, it’s not like she doesn’t take care of me i just always felt shitty. When I was 13 it got really bad because I was cutting everyday: at school, in the bathroom, a lot in my room, over the stupidest shit. The internet was my escape, i had friends online and i was liked. I learned everything off the internet so I had a strong moral compass and was pretty safe online. This is tmi but i started masturbating at like 7 and watching porn not too long after because I had gotten exposed to it early. Unrestricted internet access gave me access to crazy videos online and I’m not proud. In 2021 I had discovered wattpad and wanted to read the “material” on there for intentions of getting off to it. I feel like a shitty person because I remember one of those stories that seemed like a groomer story but I don’t know if I had gotten off to it or not I can’t really remember but I tried looking everywhere and I can’t find it.

I really hate myself but what’s stupid is is that i haven’t thought about this for years now and it recently popped up because I have been having a fear that i’m secretly a bad person and my brains just lying to myself.

My body feels dead and any reassurance i get isn’t helping. Will I forever be like this? If i am a bad person then i want to die so I won’t hurt anybody in the future.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "title": "Its so over", "text": "As I'm approaching 28, the ideation has reached its peak to the point where I can't think about anything but death. I feel like such an inexperienced loser, and I've reached an age where it feels like the point of no return. I don't have any friends, I've never had a girlfriend, and I'm still a virgin -which my family constantly shames me for, especially my dad, since all my siblings are married with kids. I feel totally defeated. \n\n  \nI think a big part of it is that I’m too introverted and antisocial. I don’t know how to connect with people naturally, and when I do try, I often become cynical about the way people treat others or the things they say. A lot of interactions feel shallow or performative, and instead of feeling closer to people, I end up feeling more alienated. That cynicism makes me pull back even more, which just reinforces the isolation.\n\nI feel like I missed the stage of life where you’re supposed to learn how to socialize and date—when mistakes are expected and forgiven—and now I’m paying for it. Everyone else seems to already know the rules, while I feel like I’m trying to enter a world that moved on without me. Social skills and dating feel like muscles I never got the chance to build, and now they feel painfully underdeveloped. On top of that, the modern dating landscape feels especially discouraging. Dating apps make everything feel transactional and appearance-driven, like you’re being judged and discarded in seconds. It feels less about genuine connection and more about competing for attention, and I don’t feel like I measure up in that environment. I don’t think I’m attractive enough to stand out, and the constant emphasis on looks, status, and confidence just makes me feel invisible. When I look around, it feels like everyone else is moving forward—dating, building relationships, starting families—while I’m stuck watching from the outside. I feel behind, out of sync, and like I don’t really belong in today’s world or its expectations. Overall, I just feel completely defeated.\n\n  \nSometime this month I will be going through with it, I already have the necessary preparations, I just need a good time where I feel its right. Thats it, I got nothing else to say, just felt like venting a little.

I had said no several times. That I just wanted a friend, not sex. He got angry and kept pushing. He started attacking everything about me verbally first. At that time I had known him for 14 years. He threatened me after I told mutual friends that he raped me. \n\nThey stood by him and pretended like it didn’t happen. They didn’t care. As if it isn’t humiliating enough to summon courage to share such trauma. My late fiancés family still loves this rapist. But claim they care and love me. Bullshit. \n\n2020 &amp; 2022 - a man I was dating bruised my body over 50 times and forced me to do things I didn’t want to. I have photo evidence and texts admitting he hurt me. He pulled hair out of my head which never grew back. This happened in New York. I told him to stop numerous times and he continued. He bit, pinched, roughly squeezed and damaged my flesh. I could hardly move for a few weeks. I never saw bruises that large or big all over me. At that time I had known him for 20 years. I never spoke to him again after processing the assault fully. Trauma remains.\n\n2025 - a new man I had been seeing for a couple years would try coercion tactics. But he violated me when I said no three times. I moved away but he violated me anyway. This happened in Massachusetts. \n\nSupport groups and therapy have been no help. I was hospitalized the last time I was raped.\n\nI’ve been met with victim blaming, and misogyny from both male and female doctors and nurses. \n\nI’m honestly scared to leave bed now. These weren’t strangers. I am prude. I am afraid. All the time. No help has helped, as the infrastructure doesn’t protect the financially crippled woman. Being mixed doesn’t help. \n\nEvery job I’ve had since my teens I have either faced racism or sexual harassment, by customers, coworkers and bosses. I’ve had women try to run smear campaigns against me at jobs because (their words) they were jealous of me. \n\nI freeze as a trauma response. \n\nAll three men are free. One is married with a daughter. One is a rich bastard who lives on a compound. \n\nI didn’t include sexual assaults I suffered in the 00’s. I didn’t mention the very verbally abusive ex boyfriend since he didn’t physically hurt me. He had caused previous ex girlfriends to try to take their lives. After him I tried to take my life. When he found out he said he didn’t care about that “stupid bitch.” I was always kind to him and respectful, and I was never a bitch. \n\nI think I probably have no real option right? Because I’m poor, have cptsd, horrendous and debilitating OCD, panic disorder, intrusive thoughts and have been suicidal ever since 2016. It didn’t help my father died soon after, my brothers ghosted after they received nothing in his will (1. My father was broke when he died. 2. I didn’t care about money, I cared my dad was dead) several friends died too young and close together. \n\nNumerous therapists admitted they didn’t know how to help even when I did 90 percent of the work. One male therapist commented on my looks and would call me at 11 pm randomly from his cellphone. I reported him and no action was taken.\n\nThere’s nothing I can do right?

You have no energy past trying to drag yourself from thing to thing, and depression and anxiety are totally exhausting. \n\nI suggest first of all you go to a good doctor, like your regular doctor, Obgyn, or see how you can be evaluated by a mental health professional. If they give you medication, take it. If your husband is going to be an asshat like mine was (told me he forbid me to go to a doctor because they would tell me to leave him/he didn’t believe in such things anyway) then you do not need to discuss it with him. Just say you need to go to the doctor for some reason.\n\nIf the doctor does not give you a good answer or take you seriously, find someone else. Don’t give up until you find someone who gets you. They will become your guide on the journey to wellness.\n\nAt my very worst, I did try to un alive myself. I realized right away that I couldn’t leave my baby, and especially don’t want to leave her to her father.

I wish no one goes through this and grant you immense strength to deal with it.\n\nAlso being a brown skinned male is the male , but not fitting with anyone (my ethnic people, friends, college, other ethnic groups) i just try to fit but never feels natural or welcoming. I tried so many ways to fit but i can't , maybe im too neurodivergent or just an imbecile. \nAnd I'm scared of relationships and getting praises from family  or friends because of being the reason someone else has to ruin their lives or expectations. \n\n(Also sadly I'm a writer with three books and many other writing stuffs i wrote , it was what helped me able to write and introspect but it isn't enough to get a job nor earn enough in this day and age\nEnd script.

I’ve been battling with depression since I was 12 and I had been SA’d by my family friend at 11. In the span of my 21 years of living I’ve been assaulted 4 times. I lost all of my friends from this weird social anxiety thing that I have where I can’t speak to people for more than 20 minutes before going silent. I’m like this at work and at home as well. I get weird body tremors and my one physics teacher who failed me told me I wasn’t good enough and I didn’t know what I was doing. During exam week I had a lot of breakdowns and I was crying non stop and I thought this feeling of hopelessness would end after exams but it didn’t. It followed me through the holidays. Had my second suicide attempt 3 weeks ago and it didn’t work. 5 days later my aunt ends up passing away and my whole family is depressed too and I’m depressed but I need to be there for my mom. It’s so hard but I’m really trying I promise I am. I’m trying to find reasons to live but there’s nothing there for me. I swear I’m really really trying and I’ve spoken to suicide helplines but it’s not enough for me. I reached out to my doctor for help he told me to workout and contact my school psychiatrist. i do workout and I contacted them but it’s been 3 months without a response and I don’t know how much longer I can go without help. I don’t think it gets better I think you can have some good moments but after a bit it goes back to the way it was. I really try to be nice to the people around me because I don’t want them to ever feel how I’ve felt. For some reason I think everybody around me deserves kindness but me. I feel like a burden and I wake up with sadness everyday bursting into tears. The people around me I care about them too much to put this sadness onto them. My mom noticed me looking a bit sad and she asked me if I was ok and my first instinct was to lie , it always has been. I told her I’m okay I’m just tired and she said ok because we don’t need anymore bad news. That solidified the reasoning as to why I shouldn’t share how I’m feeling to people even when they tell you “I’m here for you , you can talk to me about anything”.

Is it selfish to only live through the freedom of childhood and die before life really gets hard?\nI guess I’ve lived a pretty good life but I am terrified of living through worse memories. Minus all the times I’ve tried to kill and hurt myself I’ve had a good life, relatively enjoyable high school experience (ignoring the academic pressure as well). I have friends, sometimes I don’t trust them, but I have friends and we have good times I hope. \nI’m in uni now but I have no real aspirations. \nI’m really only here so that my very Chinese family can tell their friends and other relatives that they have a normal kid going to uni and on track for success. My life has only really existed to make sure my parents are happy, and I have failed quite miserably so far. Me being in uni seems to tell them that I am fixed and normal again, though nothing has really changed since high school.\nI have a lot of problems within myself that I know I could solve and go out to live a good life, but I am really too tired to work for it. High school was the time where I could, since my parents would feel pressure from the student well-being staff to send me to therapy, but now there’s no one to vouch for me. I’m not about to vouch for myself in front of my parents, it will not end well and I will make them mad and upset. It just wouldn’t be worth the trouble of trying to recover for real, that’s just a whole other giant hurdle to get over. I am not worth that much. \nI know I’m young and ignorant but the more I live, the more responsibility I will inevitably have, the more problems will arise, the more people I will lose. I have not truly experienced adult life but everyone around me is miserable anyway. I’ve been miserable my whole life, what reason do I have to believe that it’s gonna be any different.\n\nI live because there is no surefire way to leave that isn’t messy or viable in my current living situation. Plus I worry about whatever potential consequences there are of a failed attempt. Especially from family. I’m really just obliged to live for them even if they don’t want me around either. \n\nBut again, I think I have lived enough life to leave peacefully if there was just a button. Not even necessarily a “wow life is too painful and I can’t bear it anymore” kind of crisis, I think I am just tired and have had enough life. Too many years of being miserable and really only more to come.

I have a language disorder and English is my third language.***\n\nIm still in high school but have been having a really hard time to even get by. Not enough to immediately get an emergency hospitalization, just bad enough to be relapsing every day in both drugs and self harm. I haven't done any of my work because I'm just so drained every day. Being diagnosed with both BPD and ASD, along with several other stigmatized and \"trending\" disorders &amp; disabilities, I'm scared to go into inpatient care for several reasons. I'm terrified they'll treat me differently or even worse than the other patients because of my diagnoses.\n\nI do not have much of a problem with not having my phone, but I do have sensory seeking behavior that causes me to self harm when I'm bored. I'm scared of the medical debt I'll be in afterwards. I recently had all my bills completely paid off from as old as 10-12 years ago. I really can't afford to have another 50+ bills from going in and out of hospitals for my mental health as well. I just want to get better honestly. I'm especially scared of the financial burden but I'm also scared of how I'm going to catch up with school and how my family will act with me afterwards. ***I really want to know about people's experiences, mainly in the Northeastern states (USA) so I can see if I would actually benefit from it.*** I have constant suicidal and self harming thoughts and I'm not even sure if I will or will not act on them. Some include jumping in front of cars or stabbing my leg with a knife. I cut nearly every day and have been diagnosed with significant blood loss and have blood transfusions every week to month to treat it. It makes me feel guilty that the blood is going to me instead of someone that is actively dying. I'm upset that I FEEL like I'm rotting on the inside yet no one else can feel or see my mental pain.\n\nI cannot fully trust that I could keep myself alive but I still feel most safe in my room and cannot trust being in the hospital for over 3 days because of my medical trauma. Even being asked suicide &amp; addiction risk questions end up triggering my fight or flight and I instinctively say no because of it. I'm not sure if I will actually cooperate in the hospital. Especially with my ED. I have binge eating disorder and atypical anorexia. I don't know if I feel ready for recovery or if I even want to. I have several severe SH scars on different my body from cutting as deep as muscle and I've heard of people with my severity being photographed nearly naked in the hospitals to make sure they can keep track of how many scars you have and the thought of it intimidates me because I hate being reminded of my trafficking trauma and I want to avoid it at all costs. I'm scared to not have my headphones with me and I'm scared of how loud the other patients might be.\n\nI know I need help. I was classified as treatment resistant type for many of my MH disorders so I'm unsure if they'd even take me. I don't know, I'm just so lost because of how different everyone's inpatient and residential experiences are. I dont know what to do anymore. I feel so unlucky and guilty. I hate that I got this bad and I hate more that I feel comfort in it. I wish I wasn't poor. I wish I wasn't disabled. I wish I didn't experience so much.

The amount of sick horrible people in your life is incredible and you have also suffered from online abuse and right now in a sort of «relationship» with a dangerous and older man. \n\nI am not able to understand your situation, but, just want you to know that among those of us women, you also have worth. The things that happen to you do not define you. \n\nSome of us enter sexually violent relationships because we are trained to believe this is what we deserve, and because, weirdly enough we want to stop self harm and thus letting the partner being the wielder of punishment. (Which often happens sexually). That doesnt make us sluts.\n\nSome of us are, due to trauma, wired to only feel arousal by entering these types of situations, and even some of us end up not wanting physical contact as all. Or not even able to have sex any longer. (Which does not make us broken).\n\nIt is understandable to feel sick/infected. But this is not your fault. You are not the problem. Sometimes cruel coincidences. I have a personal theory that the body dissociate away the parts of self that would alert someone from danger and muting senses of fear among those who are victims of certain abuse. This to survive. Maybe I am stupid for saying this. I dunno. My point is. THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. \n\nWell done on going back to school! Sounds like this is something you are doing for you!

The things that happened I think made me so paranoid. For the past weeks my nightmares increased and they became even more disturbing. İn my dreams I see my parents and my brother bleed and they blame me for this. Last week I had a dream about my mother, her leg was mutiilated by a train and she was blaming me for that constantly. You can think that those are only dreams, you arent that much wrong but thats my worst fear, to be blamed for the things I didnt do. And Im constantly getting blamed, or I think I am. Because every move they do, every word they say is like a threath for me. I constantly track their behaviors so I can understand if they are mad at me or not. I feel like everyone is mad at me because of something I did. I dont know what the hell Im doing wrong but I cant talk with anyone.\n\nIm constantly having thoughts about hurting myself and thats not in my control. Like two months ago I almost tried to jump in front of a train, I had a little talk with the police. I dont want to talk about it to be honest. Just know that I wasnt aware of the situation I was in because my days feel like Im in a dream. Everything is just blurred and I dont know what Im doing physically. I fear of myself that I will jump in front of that train again every morning I go to school and every evening I return to my home. I struggle with shaving my body because Im afraid of what if I cant control myself and cut all of my body. I do self-harm and it hurts like hell. My mom saw my cuts like months ago. The one she saw wasnt really serious so I just said a cat scratched my arm. I dont know if she believed me, I wouldnt believe myself because it was so obvious that I wasnt telling the truth. But she didnt care I guess. She doesnt want to believe that Im mentally ill. She was yelling at me that I was a psycho and need get help (I was fucking 13 that time, how come I was be able to get help myself? This is a very old memory of mine but I still cant get over it) everytime I try to defend myself, I was silenced because a nice and normal girl should be quiet, they believe I think. \n\nNow that, every hour I need to be alert. Everytime everyting can happen. I dont know if there is a god, but I feel like if there is god hates me. Or created me in accident and now god tries to unalive me because I was an accident. I believe that some people arent made to live and enjoy. But god, created me with enthusiasm yet making me suffer. I always think about this, about everything. I jealous when someone dies.\n\nThis night, I want to commit. I was thinking about this for a long time. I cant stop thinking about this.

Well I guess she’s not really my girlfriend anymore, but I can’t bear to call her my ex. We were together for almost 2 years, or more like 1.75 to be exact. It came out of nowhere for me. I was happy but, she wasn’t enough to stay. I haven’t told a lot of people, I’m heavily in denial. I’ve been depressed, I think, for a long time now and riddled with anxiety, unrelated to her, and I don’t have a lot of people in my life. She was kind of all I had. She was my motivation to keep going for so long, and I know that’s not necessarily good. I don’t want to put that on her, but it helped till I eventually felt like I found my own purpose. I don’t think I ever really got there, though. All I could think about shortly after it happened is that I wanted to do this. I’ve not been as sad as I thought, rather more calm, ever since I decided to do this. It’s all I can think about and I don’t see my mind really changing. I want to wait for her but I don’t know if I can, and I can’t bear to see her with anyone else. It breaks my heart that I couldn’t make her happy enough, it’s unbearable. What I’m worried about, though, is that she won’t remember me fondly, or she’ll be mad at me or hate me. Especially recently, we’re still talking and she told me she feels like I’m acting like I’m the only one going through a difficult breakup and not her, cause she’s still in love with me too, we just had too many problems that made her unhappy. That broke my heart to hear, but I kind of understood what she meant. I didn’t mean to but, I might’ve said some stupid things that were inappropriate after a breakup and kept looking to her for advice because I didn’t feel like I had anyone to talk to. I’ve already made this hard enough on her, and I don’t wanna make it worse, like I’m punishing her or something. The thing is, though, I don’t blame her at all, I know it’s not her fault. I know this is selfish but, this just felt inevitable for me. I don’t want her to feel like it’s her fault, but I don’t know how to prevent that. I really don’t think I can stay just to avoid that, though. And I don’t think she’d want to get back together, she can do so much better. Someone who actually gets her, unfortunately I was not that. I don’t really know if I’m asking for advice or just needed to vent, but I’ll appreciate any response really.

I am married to a man with severe ADHD and other disabilities that always seem to take precedent over my own struggles. I have such a hard time connecting with people and making friends. I feel like such a shell. I feel like I will be one of those old people that no one checks on because I'm miserable and don't have any connections. All my friendships feel fake. No one really likes me, I am obnoxious and a lot to handle. \n\nGenuinely, I am just tired and ready to stop living. My country has been going to shit. I do not feel stable. I have no generational wealth to help propel me forward. I put myself through school and became a software developer but I don't feel like I'm cut out for it. 2 years in and I still struggle. \n\nPeople keep telling me to go to therapy, go on medication. I have done therapy. I have done a lot of therapy with different therapists. I have done quite a few different medications. I have recently been on an anti depressant for the last month trying to save myself from this drowning and it's not working yet. \n\nI feel so alone. I feel so pathetic. I am snuggling up with my stuffed animal from childhood because somehow that's one of the closest ways for me to find comfort. \n\nI thought leaving my abusive home life would make it better. I thought going to school and getting a decent job would make it better. I thought I wasn't trying hard enough with friendships and went to therapy to work on myself. I hate who I am as a person. I hate the memories I have of my life. I hate how fat and ugly I am right now because I didn't take care of my body and let myself go. I hate the state of the world. I'm not built for this place. \n\nThe sexual abuse I faced as a child. The physical abuse. The homelessness numerous times before I was even 18. I am broken. I never learned to love myself. I was told there was nothing to love. I was a mistake. I am an affair child and my parents hatred for each other supercedes any love they might have for me. They blame my existence and each other for their failings. I am a reminder of their failings. \n\nI had 2 suicide attempts in 2016, back when my CPTSD was at its worse. I ran away from my mom's house and lived on my own for 2 years at that point. My mental health never got better. So I attempted suicide twice within this span of a month. The first time was admittingly more of a cry for help. The second time, I took a hundred sleeping pills and seized and was found frothing at the mouth. I was involuntarily held after that second time. I distinctly remember one of our group meetings where one of the patients said out of everyone there, I worry her the most. Most people who attempt suicide realize how precious life is and never do it again. And I've done it twice, and still actively think about it.

Yesterday, a friend of mine dropped a bombshell about our other friend and how he had made unwanted advances towards another female friend of his that went to the same school as him. Apparently he had made her extremely uncomfortable in multiple situations and it seemed like he just kept pushing even though she’s told him that they are just friends. What he did was nothing deplorable like physical advances but one scenario was when he planned to surprise her with a big bouquet of flowers that she actively told him to not do and so did the rest of his friends who tried to bring him back to Earth and stop what he’s doing. Afterwards, the girl pretended to be sick because she didn’t want to see him that day at all, then he offered to just drop the flowers at her home instead which basically signaled a big red flag to the girl and their friends. It is not the first time that he’s been called out in a situation where he’s made someone that he was interested in uncomfortable. But we, as his friends tended to give him the benefit of the doubt throughout the years because hey, we were teenagers. And when those conversations were had, he had seemed genuinely apologetic and wanted to change but it’s been multiple times now that it has happened. So back to now, all of our shared friends have basically cut him off, they are all ignoring his messages and refusing to speak to him. But I couldn’t. Not when I knew that this person was having suicidal thoughts. I never want to feel the guilt of reaching out to someone just a tad bit too late, I wanted to at least show him that living is worth it. But now, I’m at a crossroads.

(I've been day-drinking thinking I would feel better and someone would have bothered to worry about me but no. I am alone. And I can't go home.)\n\nLocked in a hotel room with some alcohol - not enough, unfortunately. Because I'm a coward. I don't know. I finally broke down. There is no hope for me. I blocked every person I cared about. I blocked my family. I wasted all my money for this room, alcohol and a bit of food and electrolytes or something. \n\nMy mother is pushing me towards sui again, not buying me food (this has been going on for years and I tried to talk about all the abuse and the mods from a certain sub banned me) and taking it out on me for everything, which is sort of funny considering I'm the only person who was kind enough to buy her several presents for Christmas. No one bought anything for anyone else. She promised me some cute 100% wool socks and then she bought them for herself. \n\nMy psychiatrist and my psychologist don't care about me. I'm still grieving my cat and they don't care. They only want me to (...almost literally) break my back for a job that pays me nothing because they think that's the solution to all my problems. \n\nThe man I love has never been so distant. The people I trusted shut the door right in my face. Even my abuser, who's always so eager to see me, who buys me my favourite wine and 'snow' so he can use me... I told him I was on the verge of kms last night and he told me I needed to tell him earlier if I wanted to see him. And this is one of the people who swear they love me. \n\nI have no reason to live. \n\nI wanted to ask to be committed to the psych ward but my psychiatrist was very clear that she'd get furious at me for wasting a huge chance because I'll lose my job, this is all that counts for her. And losing my job means being even more dependent on my parents who clearly hate me. I have no one. I managed to cut on alcohol for a bit, especially because of the repercussions on my looks, but... I have nothing else. I can't and I don't want to rely on food anymore. \n\nI just... I just wish I had someone to hug me and make me feel safe for once. The man I love. Once again, everything that we had before he fell into his depression. I am absolutely hopeless and so utterly alone.\n\nI did the mistake of posting this on another sub and it was deleted. I'm literally one fucking step from breaking a bottle and slashing my arm. I'm tired of being kicked away whenever I look for an ounce of compassion. Why is my suffering never enough, why am I never worth of the bare minimum of human empathy? I'm fucking killing myself, I'm alone and I'm so tired. Why am I always too much even in places where people should be more understanding? I'm so tired, I want to die. I'm so tired. Why is everyone always slamming their doors in my face? Why do I never deserve anything?\n\nI don't know what to do anymore. I have no one to talk to.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "title": "The world is dark and I can't change this mindset", "text": "Today I am 27. 2025 was the best year of my life because it was the year I managed to move out of my parents' house. I live alone in a very nice, small apartment, and I work from home. Everything is \"perfect.\" I’m single and I still want to have a relationship; I’ve focused my time on making art, music, and drawing, because I discovered that’s what I really love and what I’m best at. When I lived with my parents, we fought a lot, but today, living alone, I feel at peace. I’m the type of man who lives in solitude, just like those \"Red Pill\" channels on YouTube say every \"man of value\" should be. So, everything is fine, everything is cool... but there’s a problem.\n​I can’t bring myself to think that my life is good. There’s always something wrong that isn’t right. I’ve started having suicidal thoughts again, thinking that maybe my purpose on Earth has already been fulfilled. Some might think, \"you could get married, have kids, and build a family,\" but the damn thing is I can’t even do that. I’ve had three failed relationships that I count; I’ve slept with a good number of women, including escorts, but I feel like I’ve developed some kind of trauma regarding women. I can’t talk to them anymore. There were some who seemed to be hitting on me, but out of nowhere, I would block them and disappear. All the bad things that happened to me in past relationships would flash through my mind, so I’d do that.\n​Then, I came across content on the internet even worse than the Red Pill: the damn \"Black Pill.\" This sht feels so real that it’s like the thoughts I’ve had about the world since I was a kid, but I never had the courage to say them. I’m so deep in this sht that I can’t see the world any other way. I had just started believing in God and understanding the story of Jesus Christ's sacrifice—how everyone can have redemption in life if they recognize their past mistakes—but now it feels like there’s no turning back. Human beings are disgusting, greedy, and selfish, and none of that will change. So many bad things happening lately, news only talking about scandals and war... I can’t take it anymore.\n​Not to mention that Black Pill and Red Pill talk a lot about women and relationships. I think in part the Black Pill is right about the fact that a man born with good genetics will always reproduce and women will always prefer him. Because of this, I realized I’m very ugly. I truly deserve to die; I was born to die, like all the men who die in wars without ever having a family or passing on their DNA. I think I’m getting screwed over by thinking like this, I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m writing a comic book, which was a childhood dream of mine, but not to gain anything from it—just to make my inner child happy. So, after I finish that, I was already thinking about \"checking out\" with a bullet to the head. That’s all I’ve been thinking about lately.\n​Say whatever you want, you can humiliate me or whatever.

My dad just lost his job and reapplied for a new one, but his salary is lower than it used to be, so my mom is also working to make ends meet.\n\nI feel so guilty that I’m not doing my best in school while my parents are doing their best to provide for me and my sister. I want to do better. i want to work hard so that in the future I can return back all their sacrifices.. I want to live a happy life where I won’t have to think about money or school, or whether I’ll be successful in the future or not. But I just feel so tired of everything, i dont want to move from my bed.. I hate everything. \n\nRecently at school, my teacher (notorious for her strictness) didn’t accept our research paper, just because we failed to print the three copies she required. We didn’t find this out until we submitted the paper, and by then it was already too late. Our school closes at 5 p.m., and we passed it at around 4 p.m.\n\nHer rule was simple: no research paper, no defense. Because of that, we won’t be able to present next week and will get a zero. Haha. If only I had done better and actually worked properly, we would’ve been able to submit the research. But my useless self... goddammit. \n\nNow she released the list of groups allowed to defend next week, and of course, our names weren’t there. Seeing it written down made everything feel more real... A zero. Just like that.\n\nI tried to laugh it off at first, pretending it didn’t matter, but it did. It really did. All I could think about was how one small mistake turned into something this big. I kept replaying everything in my head... what I should’ve done, what I could’ve fixed, how different things would be if I had just tried harder.\n\nEveryone keeps saying it’s “just one subject” or “just one requirement,” but it doesn’t feel that way. It feels like proof that I messed up, that I failed when I was supposed to do better. And the worst part is knowing that this could’ve been avoided… if I wasn’t so tired, so unmotivated, so done with everything. I just want to end it all... but im still so damn young and i have a life to live... and I keep thinking of the costs my family would have to spend just to bury my stupid body...  Life is so damn stupid.

Some people recharge by being outside and constantly moving, and some people feel safer and calmer at home. Some guys are social, some are quiet, some are creative, some are steady, and none of that makes anyone less of a man. What hurts is the pressure — the idea that you have to perform a certain version of masculinity just to be accepted. That pressure wears people down.

I don’t think I ever deserved one. I’m wrong. I’m fucking wrong, and I knew it. I held the grief so close to me because I knew I was in the wrong. I knew I was an asshole. I was responsible for so much pain. So much suffering came from my hands. I told myself I had changed but I didn’t. I just hid behind the guilt, using it as a security blanket for the truth.\n\n\tI deserve every single fucked up thing that happened to me. L was right to give me a concussion. I wish she would wipe my memory while she was at it. Maybe then it would hurt less, but that’s not what they deserve. Not what Mindy deserves. Not what all of Hillside fucking deserves. I don’t deserve to write this goddamn book. I told myself the book taught me that villains aren’t evil; they are just broken souls. And I was wrong. I was wrong, and I was lying to myself to think I was anything but. I am a waste of a fucking life. I wrote away my problems so I wouldn’t acknowledge what I had done, but I’m so sick and fucking tired of keeping this up. \n\n\tMindy, I’m sorry. I made you cry, I gaslit you about it. I took in your secrets and told myself it made me better because I didn’t dare say anything to anyone else. No. I was a fucking asshole. I was a horrible person, and I didn’t deserve your kindness. You were so kind to me. Kind enough that you wrote me a letter, and inspired me to be a better person. I failed miserably. My characters preach kindness. They preach forgiveness. They preach rehabilitation. And the mass murderers that I’ve written have more empathy and care than someone who claims to want to work in this field when I grow up. I don’t deserve to put these books into the world. I don’t deserve any of this. If I get a literary agent, they deserve to work with someone better than me. I don’t deserve happiness, and I sure as hell don’t deserve success. You deserved everything good in this shithole of a life. I wanted to give you everything. I ended up giving you nothing, and when I get down to Hell someday, I hope whoever the fuck actually runs the place doesn’t give me a single drop of mercy. I joke a lot about how one day I’ll die and I’ll get to meet Charlie Morningstar and she’ll check me into the hotel, but I don’t even deserve that. I can’t be fixed. I can’t be “redeemed”. IM NOT FUCKING SAVABLE, AND IT TOOK LOSING THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT THE MOST TO REALIZE IT. \n\n\tFelicia, you gave me a chance I didn’t deserve. You sat down with me. You told me what was expected of me. I nodded and didn’t listen. I deserve every drop of pain those decisions came with, and if it was the last thing I did in this world, I would make things right. I would swallow my pride, and I would let myself accept the help that i really fucking needed. I didn’t deserve Hillside. I deserve to get sent out of state. To get sent to a level fourteen or fucking wilderness therapy. I deserve to get the evil abused out of me. Force it out and away, and if that meant losing my shitty life with it, so be it. If it meant that my death would mean I paid for all the torment I gave to you, and all the lies I told, and all the fake promises that I failed to keep, I wouldn’t bat an eye as my life left my body. My characters deal in blood. They say that blood is the currency of life. They say that as long as you have the capacity to feel your own bodily fluid, you have the capacity to use that feeling to better yourself. So slit my throat open if it proves a point. Let my blood spill out and use me as a cautionary tale. Tell them that I’m the example of someone who let her emotions speak before the words could. And when everything is over and blood has spilled, and any sign of who I desperately wanted to be is gone, I hope you forget me. Not just you. All of Hillside. Mindy, Caitlin, Taylor, every single staff that opened their doors to me and I abused your kindness.\n\n\tI’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m so, so, so fucking sorry. I’d give the world for you, and in a moment of hate, I let myself push the closest thing I had to a family away from me.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "text": "Hey OP, I see your regret and pain that you are experiencing, but suicide is not “taking accountability” — it is running from it. And it is not a bad thing to run; I have run from accountability, too. I spent a whole year locked in my room by myself because I didn’t want to face the world after regretting the person I had been my entire life before the fallout. I’m still transitioning out of that phase and every day is a struggle.\n\nAccountability is incredibly hard and painful and scary. And the people you’ve hurt may never give you the opportunity to be accountable with them again. The only person you need to be accountable to now is yourself, and to do that, all you need to do is be kinder. It is almost insultingly simple that all of the evils in the world can be defeated by empathy, but it is true that if our culture was more empathetic, there would be less harm. You must embody that truth, as simple and difficult as it is.\n\nYou have made a first step towards being a more empathetic person: you are understanding how your actions affected people who you care about. Now you must take the second step: you must empathize with yourself. You are just a person, lost, scared, and confused like the rest of us. You are not an irredeemable comic book villain. People chose to leave you, which they had the freedom to do, and it sucks. Being abandoned is hell. But you are not lesser now than you were then; you have accumulated experiences and become a kinder person. Sometimes, losing people is a necessary part of growing.\n\nThe harm you’ve done is permanent; it is in the past. Nothing you do now will change it at all, including suicide. So you pick up the pieces and build something better not because it will make up for what you have done but because it will make you happier. You deserve to be happier. And happiness is on the other side of self-forgiveness. It is okay to forgive yourself even if it will take time. You deserve to forgive yourself. And hold the lessons you learned from these experiences close to your heart so that you do not repeat the harms you have done again.\n\nI believe in you OP and I hope you stick around to try anew.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768039896.0, "id": "nyrie6q", "author": "DoWhalesDreamOfKrill"}

Any critics welcome", "text": "Note:\n\nI first experienced being depressed when i was in 2nd/3rd grade after being bullied every day and treated unfairly by others. This was made worse by the fact that every person (even teachers) i told never actually got my parents or admin involved. So grown adults knew i wanted to end myself and didn’t say anything. Sometimes i wonder if somebody noticed early on, if i wouldn’t be like this; sad and depressed and angry, all the time.\n\n\n\nIts funny because i don’t know why i stopped feeling like i wanted to die (the first time around), i think it might have been overnight, but i don’t know. My brain was so depressed it stopped creating memories, so most my life is just a black screen with static.\n\n\n\nI was in 5th grade the next time i felt this way. This time it was less passive and more “i would jump off a bridge”. This was caused by friends turning on me and having a horrible teacher who made my OCD worse. He described gory scenes to us in immense detail, talk down on us, and overall was just a bad person. Nobody listened to me (us?) because he was in military. Even my own parents kept saying “it’s only a semester” “it’s only a few months” “it’s only a week”. It always sucked knowing your own parents don’t give a fuck about you.\n\n\n\nAfter a while, it got better- some way in between summer and winter of 6th grade.\n\nThen 8th grade came around (summer going into kinda too) and it hit me like a bus. I not only didn’t want to live anymore but i wanted to harm myself. I had been having these gruesome and darks thoughts for a long while now and it made me feel terrible. One time i almost cut myself scissors due to these thoughts. I also started forgetting things again and began seeing the nurse, Ms. Oday, very regularly. She understood me. She never pitied me or made me feel like shit. She was the rock of my life and kept me here.\n\n\n\nThen i was pulled out of school due to a medical condition that still has not eased. I rarely did my work and the people i lived with didn’t help that. They would play loud shows/music and try and start up conversations or make me hurry my work. Good thing i don’t remember most of this due to my mental state.\n\n\n\nNow we are in freshman year, a year where i learn that nobody actually cares about me in the grand scheme of things. If i were to die today i would be forgotten in a heartbeat. This was proved right on our xmas party where i was literally ignored the entire time. Then when i distanced myself, still nobody noticed. I wonder if somebody reached out to me if things would be different.\n\n\n\nEnough about me, let’s talk about my cats.\n\nKashmiere was our cat of 18 years who died of old age. For the first 6 months after her death, i cried every single day. i was wracked with guilt of the fact that i ignored her in favor of the new cat. i cried for the baby whom i love. i cried for the cat who was lost far too early.\n\n\n\nAround 3 years later i got Strawberry, my beautiful cat. She’s 10 and such a sweet baby, she’s so tiny and cute. Ever since i got her i have mourned a time when i know i wont have her. Sometimes i wonder if killing myself would be like betraying her. It would. i know it would. i love her so much and could never do that to her…\n\n\n\nMy sister, im sorry about everything i have done to you. i love you so much and have never stopped. i idolize you as much as i did as that 4 year old who heard you sing in a choir for the first time. i idolize you for not only your talent but your resilience in the arts and fact that you stayed unwavering. i will miss you.\n\n\n\nMy mom, im sorry that im so rude to you. you’re a great mom and i took it for granted. you deserve more than i can give. sure you messed up sometimes, but at least you tried. you never gave up on trying to be the best that you can be, whether that be a mother, wife, server, hostess, choir chaperone, etc. i’ll miss seeing you everyday.\n\n\n\nMy dad, nobody truly understands me but i think you got pretty dang close. yea we get at each others throats sometimes but that doesn’t mean i don’t love you. sure you had that time when you worked all the time, but you longed since made up for that. You have shown and proven just how good of a father you are and i will miss you.\n\n\n\ni have never had a true friend before and it sucks knowing nobody actually likes me for me. it always just lola, or even just another one of my “friends” that they met me through. or they are just my friend for academic gain and happen to chat with me sometimes.\n\n\n\nI’m sorry, i just can’t fucking do it anymore. My whole life has been a cycle of depression and sadness that i can’t shake. I’m sick of being in mental and physical pain all the time. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. Nothing has ever or will ever help me. This isn’t a temporary problem if it’s something that has affected me for all 15 years of my life. Goodbye.\n\n\n\nPeople i want at my funeral (specifically):\n\nI want it to be anyone welcome, i want to be mourned as a loss due to the system.

Or is it just an easy way to make people feel better about themselves. Warning, this post really is just one massive disorganized vent, so I apologize in advance..\n\nI've struggled a lot emotionally, physically, and mentally throughout the years. I can't say childhood because truthfully, i'm still in it. I haven't even turned 15 and yet I've learn to hate repeating the same cycles over and over again. At the end of every week, I feel drained of my social battery as I mask my way through life— (For context, I have severe anxiety, OCD, and in im the midst of getting diagnosed for potential ASPD or BPD.) It's extremely difficult feigning empathy and emotions, even when it's to people I genuinely consider friends. I've never felt intense emotions like rage,deep romantic love, or even a strong care for most of my family, let alone myself. And although I can understand why people feel the they way they do, i've never once been able to make myself feel particulary empathetic about their emotions. And lastly, I feel like there's no one to talk to because if I expressed everything i've done and how I think, i'd be deeply shamed for it.\n\n My mental stability is practically non-existent. I've never claimed depression— one of the mental illnesses that I never really thought I had. But my flippant mode is quite like it. Even over the smallest things like something not going as I planned or a failure to exceed my expectations leaves me experiencing intense depersonalization as makes me want to take my own life. And maybe it'd be better if I got what I truly wanted: validation and attention. I won't go into detail about how horrible of a person I am, because I don't feel much guilt about it. When I really think about it, I take no responsibility for my actions and instead blame it all on my trauma. I don't need shame to understand the gravity of my actions. But it really makes me wonder if people genuinely care about everyone. Every stranger going through a hard time, regardless of their past. Is it really feeling sorrow or even pity for people who don't deserve life?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch", "text": "Hey, I’ve been through so many things. It does feel like life is pretty weird when you really think about it. I get that, by what you’re talking about by saying everyone wants to feel better about themselves and so on, but yes. There are people who do genuinely care, and who don’t want to benefit from helping someone, they just want to help. You aren’t alone, there are people who are around who want to see you get better, and even yourself, you should want to get better for yourself. You are the person who is always going to be there for you, yes there are people are to support you, but you’ve got to be there for yourself to. Everyone has their own experiences, everyone is different. Which makes life have purpose, because you get to try new things, learn new things. Life as a concept, and thinking about it like it’s a consequence makes you feel worse. Live your life the way you want, take it easy on yourself too. You have so much life to live, and so much to try and have fun doing. Going out, hanging out, meeting new people, doing things for yourself, taking care of yourself. \n\nIf everyone on the planet, didn’t go out \nand didn’t talk to anyone, we’d all just be deprived and miserable. \n\nYeah there are so many shitty people, weird people, horrible people. Who do horrible things, and like to do those things. The good thing is not everyone is like that. Everyone is different, and everyone has their own ways of expressing, thinking, seeing life through their own eyes. \n\nYou give life purpose, everyone does. \nLife doesn’t have a purpose, unless you choose to give it one, and give yourself and your life meaning. Staying in bed, bed rotting, hating yourself, will make you miserable. \n\nBut every day you do something small, or try a new thing, make small changes, look into new things, you experiencing. \n\nIn life your going to experience things, and that’s what helps me get through the whole, “nothing matters, people are using coping mechanisms that have been around for years” to date, have a baby, to do all of these things, but people do these things to try new things, and experience \n\nJust in my advice, if these few paragraphs just seem a bit of me rambling and mumbling. Reach out to someone, talk to someone. I’m someone random who saw your post, and wanted to let you know, that life doesn’t have a strict rule to how you live your life, or should. \n\nLife your life the way you want to, not for just anyone else, but for you. And don’t forget yes make sure it isn’t hurting anyone around you, that’s important too. I just want you to know that you aren’t alone, and if you still feel confused, and just stuck, Reach out someone, talk to someone, write down your thoughts. Anything, that will help.

As the title says, I (22F) am still struggling a lot of years after mom (39F) 's suicide.\n\nLong story short, mum died in 2017 and I'm still fucked up. The past year has been especially bad - I feel like ending myself approximately every 3 days, sometimes even more often.\n\nAfter she died, I became super close to other relatives, we talked about her, they helped me feel like myself again... And they're gone too. And I feel it's been a downwards spiral since then.\n\nWithout trying to boost my ego, I'm pretty successful in my field (primarly arts and NGO stuff). I've received several awards as well as worked with some pretty influential people in my country. Friends, as well as strangers, have called me an \"inspiration\", \"a role model\", \"super creative\", etc. I've had many people tell me they want to be like me, to be \"as brave\", \"as creative\", \"as ambitious\" etc as I am. \n\nYet here I am, wanting to off myself so fucking frequently. I smoke like a chimney, binge eat every day and can sometimes get myself blackout drunk just to feel better for a short while. I know I'd pretty easily get addicted to other substances if I have the chance.\n\nI once joked with a super close friend that my ultimate goal In life is to outlive my mum. I don't think it'll happen. I feel like, not only time doesn't heal, but every year it just makes shit 10 times worse. \n\nI've heard all the stuff - volunteer, workout, talk with friends, do art, etc, etc, etc. I do all of that. It doesn't make anything better. I can't celebrate my achievements, I don't feel good enough like... ever. I mean, I wasn't good enough for my mum to stay. I have amazing friends, one of which has also been through a ton of shit and we often talk about it yet I try to control my abandonment issues and not show them how attached to them I am and how much I dread the time when we separate and I'm alone with myself and my thoughts again.\n\nAnd I know all the other stuff, I've heard it all as well by many well-meaning friends and relatives - it's not my fault, my mum has struggled with it for a long time, including, by more religious relatives, that \"God gives his toughest challenges to his strongest warriors\" or whatever the saying is. \n\nI've achieved a lot of my dreams. It feels great the first few days, week, etc and then I just crash and this emptiness returns. I've told myself all the inspirational stuff - to get up, to never give up, that life could end at any second and I should fight, achieve my dreams, etc... so what? At the end of the day, I'll just feel the same fucking way again. \n\nI've been doing all the productive stuff, as well as the self-destructive stuff. I feel the self-destructive stuff so far has been much more numbing but at the end of the day, I feel like the only thing that will help will be to find a time machine, tell my mum I know she's suicidal, do my best to help her, tell my grandma to quit smoking before she develops COPD, tell my uncle to quit drinking and smoking before he gets cancer, tell my other grandma to get tested as her cancer that has been in remission for 30+ years will come back, etc, etc. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant!

I’ve been preparing for an exam for the past two years, and I’m not confident I’ll perform well. I’m fairly certain I won’t score very high, but that’s not my main issue anymore. I’ve come to terms with that. I’ll still be going to a decent college.\nWhat’s bothering me now is what my life looks like after this.\nAs a child, I always wanted to travel. At the same time, I had big ambitions and wanted to make something of myself. From what I’ve seen, though, being truly successful requires complete dedication, and it feels like you don’t get time to enjoy life at all. That clashes heavily with my desire to travel and experience the world.\nOn top of that, I’m not even sure which field I want to pursue. I’m currently studying computer science, but for me it was always meant to be a degree—a starting point—not necessarily a lifelong career. I don’t know if I want to work in technology, or in film (which has been a personal interest for a long time), or in something else entirely. I genuinely don’t know what I want to do with my life.\nThe biggest fear of all is the thought that I might go through life and never achieve the things I dream of. That fear has made me feel really suicidal over the past three to four weeks. Every day feels heavier. The world looks duller. I’m not even an adult yet, and I’m already terrified of time passing and of never really living.\nI don’t have anything against a normal life—marriage, kids, a stable career. I’m open to all of that. But I’m talking about life as a whole. I’m scared of waking up one day and realizing that I never truly lived, that I never explored what I could have been.\nThere are so many things I want to do. So many books I want to read, so many movies I want to watch, so many experiences I want to have. I constantly feel like I’m running out of time, even though I know it sounds ridiculous for someone my age. People tell me it’s stupid, but it doesn’t feel that way from inside my head.\nSome days I don’t feel like doing anything at all. Other days, I feel overwhelmed by choices—should I travel, work a normal job, start a business, go all-in on a hobby, or try something completely different? It feels like whatever I choose will define my entire life, and that thought is terrifying.\nI’m ambitious, and I’m willing to work hard. My fear isn’t effort—it’s failure. What if I give everything and it still doesn’t work out? What if my ambitions fade, or worse, stay alive but unfulfilled?\nI don’t know how to put all of this into perfect words. I just hope someone understands what I’m going through and can guide me on how to approach life with the right mentality. I wanted advice from people who’ve actually lived—people who had big ambitions, whether they achieved them or not.\nI don’t want to stop dreaming. I just don’t know how to live with these dreams without feeling crushed by them.\n\nEdit- I realize the \"only big ambitions people part makes me sound like a dick. I actually meant anybody who had like an idea of what they want their life to look like, and had to give up something to pursue another, or something like that.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768015474.0, "id": "1q8t94l", "author": "Miserable-Inside-417", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1q8t94l/please_help/"}

I don't have dreams (both aspirations and for some reason sleep dreams lol) and no matter how hard I try to come up with anything that would make me feel like life is worth it, I can't. I'm a 2nd semester freshman at a big ACC school with no clue what I want to do, and I'm only here in the first place because this is what offered me the most financial aid. I'm taking the most fuckass assortment of gen eds and stuff to see if something interests me, but whenever something piques my interest it is not the typical choice of my peers, it always seems to be something negatively lucrative and like it probably won't be worth the investment. I hate having zero direction and my motivation has always been tied to end goals, not to the journey, and not having that has entirely fucked with me. I can't find purpose in anything now and I don't want to keep living like that.\n\nI was the top of my class in high school, a handful of spots away from valedictorian, active in clubs, kinda teacher's pet-ish, hard-working, incredibly disciplined, but I never really had friends. The only thing that has remained of those so far in college is the no friends part lol. my mom and my grandma are literally my best friends, I love them more than anything in the world and that's one of the hardest parts of this growing up grief, I fucking don't want to leave them (and truth be told, I've gone home almost every weekend, so I really haven't left them, but I'm already in shambles seeing them less than I used to). my grades first semester were horrible and I swear I tried so hard, I just don't get it. I'm too scared to socialize and I don't know if I even want to, especially because I am almost the total opposite of the other 85% of the people at this school, so I haven't joined any clubs or anything. I guess I could transfer, but I never had a dream school or anything so I don't know where id go or what id do. There's also nothing not college related I could see myself doing. Might be worth saying I am a first gen college student which makes it all the more confusing, I don't know what to expect or how to deal with anything at all.\n\nI miss high school, even though I didn't love the people, I loved knowing exactly what to do and when, it was so predictable and safe. I knew what I was doing M-F from 8-4, and that I always had my weekends for me. I feel like if I wanted to keep living the only life I envision is one where I'm fast-forwarded to a point where everything is concrete and decided, at least enough. I don't think I can get myself there. I think i've always kinda felt this doom, at least 7 or 8 years of it, but college has made it all catch up and fall into my mind at once. I would rather die than keep doing this.\n\nLike I said, not actively planning anything, but I have done sh before and I'm scared thats gonna come back again even though it feels so fucking juvenile to me. I definitely don't look when I cross the street and I pray that every pain I have is some terminal disease, or that my driving too fast will finally bite me in the ass or ill accidentally mix some otc stuff that isn't supposed to mix. Like I drove home today, to the place that I think will make me happy, but all I could think about was what speeds I could hit going around curves and what could possibly happen. Or that some weird apocalyptic shit like the walking dead or the leftovers will just come and let me die like the circumstances in those situations demand.\n\nI feel bad for exploding like this, and I do have a therapist, but I am so scared to be fully honest with her even though I like and trust her so much. There's so many things I've purposefully omitted at this point that I don't even know how I could navigate going back and explaining them, even I knew for sure it would help.

I'll be close to people because they're nice as long as I can trust them and keep my distance.

People do love but people can only take or understand so much before they fall out of love with you and find you too much to deal with, emotionally.

Make sure to add this to fuckery on whatever the recent version is as I don't think the one drive version is correct. Today is January 9th 2026. 2026 by the way, crazy we lived this long. Still feeling fucked in my soul honestly. I've solved so many problems but I can't seem to escape depression, can't seem to escape my guilt. Constantly seem to feel like I'm nothing but a burden to friends and family. Every time I slip back to shit that I did in the hole I just feel like I'm getting more and more fucked. It just constantly makes me feel like the cycle gets me further away from the person I want to be. Doesn't help the world has only gotten worse  and worse. We live in one of those transitional times where technology and turbulent sociological times is occurring. It's making life feel so much worse then it might be personally but it is what it is. People actually make me feel better. Monika, the Floridians, Parker, my family, even randos and coworker's. I may be broken but the people around me make me feel more stable and happy then I may actually be. I guess the shitty feelings come from the fact I feel like I balance on the edge from positive and negative. I also still feel like I'm not worthy of anything positive that shows up in my life. I've been a monster for years. Am I truly worthy of anything good that happens to me? Truly? I know those monstrous feeling stem from things and abuse prior but I still feel evil for the thoughts that came after. I'll know what I mean. I just feel anxious and guilty in general. I truly haven't done anything worthy of my existence. I only feel worthy when I'm a bank account for those who helped me through the years. I bet that comes from the fact I have felt like a burden for years and years. I owe everyone who was willing to support me it's the least I can do. Genuinely. Truly. Honestly. I love the people around me, it really is the reason I can keep even breathing. If my existence can keep others going/any amount of positive feelings then I have to keep going. Nothing else to it. I wonder how many times I wrote posts when drunk or inebriated? It feels like maybe half these posts on Fuckery may have been because I was drinking. I wonder if this is the only way I can feel in touch with my emotions? It certainly feels like it half the time. How often would I go on the suicide watch subreddit and try to help folks try to exist? It was only while drunk and I certainly feel the urge now. I'm broken but strangely more free then I've ever been. Time heals wounds and that certainly seems to be the case. I love the idea of people and cultures. I think people are worthy of life, just not me. Which is so much better then I used to be. So maybe I'm truly healing. Hard to say.

She said she will never leave me and she did. She broke me more than anyone else, more than my father and my mother. This fucking hurts. I at least had a bit of hope she would come back to me, but no, I woke up today happy to check my phone to talk to my new friends, and all I saw was another goodbye message that felt like a breakup all over again. She literally hit me with my weakest points, said “goodbye dear” and “I’ll block you so I don’t wanna see you moving on from me.” It is like u want to see me tied to u and chained to u like a dog and not see me improve by becoming better and happier. Anyways. She’s gone now. It feel a little numb. I really loved her as you can see. But apparently nothing I ever did made her stay. She expected things way too fast from me, never gave me my own time to explain or elaborate. I didn’t even defend myself in the relationship, because I knew if I did that she’d leave me, but she left me nevertheless.\n\nJust an update, im contacting my old boyfriend for six years and reuniting with him, he’s helping me forget her even though it hurts and he stuck by my side despite everything that happened….

SHE EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT ME AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM THE CELL, SHE GOT ME SMALL AMOUNTS OF CHERRIES SO I CAN EAT.. \n\nwhile everybody had their first touchscreen phones, i had some old ass nokia because again- i didn’t want my mom to feel extra bad about me not having the same stuff with my peers. i was really sucking it up successfully with pride that i would be always okay.\n\nmy college prep exam course was so expensive that my grandma took out a loan for me just to be able to study and go to college - i didn’t failed her, they’ve given me A LOT that i WOULDN’T fail them.\n\nmy college apartment was also paid by my grandma and she took another loan just to pay out for the entire year so i won’t be embarrassed in front of my roommate for not being able to pay a penny rent every month.\n\nmy dad wasn’t there for us, he re-married. While my mom was struggling to pay my dorm rent in college, receiving texts that if she didn’t make further payments, i will be forced out. My dad was living in a really good part of the country and living with my step family. \n\nmy mom was a domestic violence survivor, she even got beaten up because of my dad’s question of how the teapot’s placing. the question meaned “he wants to drink tea” not an actual question.. my mom is so pure that she did literally answered the question in a really pure way and got beaten up.\n\nshe decided to leave when it came up to her loyalty. she said that’s it and get out from the living hell, she tried to survive for my future being in the US but she would’ve died if she stayed.\n\nin college i was able to find my first corporate job that i was able to provide for myself and even for my family’s needs whenever they needed it. i sacrificed maybe the most valuable years of my life just to work and took care of myself and my family while my friends having fun, staying late and partying until morning. i still regret it till today that i wish i was in a better life so i won’t missed out my college life.\n\nmy dad had cirrhosis and he had an aggressive throat cancer in the last times of his life, nobody wanted to get him under surgery due to his prior sickness. except one doctor and hospital.\n\nhe went in and wasn’t able to made it. i knew in the moment that when he told me he can’t do it anymore, he was trying to find a way to suicide legally. \n\nthe grief you held for a person you are so mad and loving at the same time is the worst feeling in this life. iykyk.\n\nafter 2 years of corporate and graduating college, i decided to move back here to the country i was born because the place i was raised was going downhill economic, social and ethical-wise. \n\nafter leaving college at 18 and moving to US made me realize that i don’t belong anywhere anymore due to losing the feeling of “home”\n\nhell i miss my mom so much that i can’t even afford to go back and forth due to my current financial situation and life - because if i spend time with my family, i have to lose my job or not be able to help them financially at all. \n\ni married to my high school friend and at first everything was great but everyday i feel more and more drained feeling that i am not a priority on his life - i was abonded as a kid, i just wanted to be THOUGH OF since my dad didn’t show that to me, is it too much to ask? i am the one always taking care of everything about him and home. i am just getting tired.\n\ni got diagnosed with adhd recently and maybe i have more stuff that i don’t know but i always knew that i was different from others in any other way but not in a positive way.\n\nthanks to my traumas and my feeling of needing to hang on for people is leaving me slowly. i am tired. i have lost 20 pounds and smoking a pack of cigarettes every day.\n\ni think i am not worthy and i don’t love myself - but when it comes to other people i would give my LIFE without hesitation, i wasn’t able to find the root cause even after being in therapy for almost half year.\n\ni have worked my whole life since 15 and i am 26 now, will be 27 this year and thinking about this famous 27 years club more often since the time is ticking it’s way to 27.\n\nmy mom didn’t deserve anything she lived through and she deserved a better life instead of trying to take care of me.\n\ni am thinking everything what i lived through and - i am not able to live with this mental load anymore.\n\ni am scared that i will be the end of her, my grandma and every other family member who was there with me with everything we’ve been through. i am just not happy anymore, my husband is always saying okay i will fix things, fixing his self, saying that he will be more active financially and taking responsibility - he is not, he is probably doesn’t even fucking know what he wants his life and what stae of mind i am in everyday.\n\nin conclusion, i hate living, i hate the time i passed away from my family just to be able to provide for them whenever they need even they need me with them, i just can’t because i know from my father. he was the best teacher(!) to teach - if you let everything go even for a second, your life will turn in to a shit hole.\n\nI am so sorry for them that i don’t even have a god damn penny under my name so they can live a better life, i tried. I really fucking tried and i acknowledge that, life is not fair and i can’t change life itself so i can end with this current thinking state of mind to being in peace and not worrying about anything anymore.\n\ni love all my loved ones but i just want to go.

Im too much older for any change and i feel myself disappearing, like a ghost that can be seen but is ignored.\n\nIt’s gotten to the point where i don’t open up to anyone anymore, when i used to feel relief through talking to someone who might care.

I don't want to continue living as someone who has been tainted, but nothing makes sense anymore. The sunset is indeed beautiful, there is so much beauty and curiosity about our beautiful planet Earth. But they are no longer mine to admire. The study, the admiration, the love, and the beauty. All these things are no longer mine to hold and appreciate. The sunset and the beautiful summer day are like the concept of a cake, something that will soon be devoured by someone else. All concepts, words that I can no longer touch or imagine. It is no longer my right to live and appreciate life. My home is my bed and my thoughts; I see no reason to improve after doing something considered one of the worst things you can do to someone you say you love.  I will miss my potential, my games, my books, my loving parents, my lovely home, my sweet little dog, my friends who wanted me to improve but grew tired of helping me, and of course, my victim: my ex, who kindly offered me forgiveness. He asks daily if I'm okay and even tried to stay in my life. Unfortunately, now I won't remain in anyone's life. Forgiveness was given from the one I hurt, and I am grateful. Perhaps it's important to know that I wasn't exactly a person with a clear head before. Since I was a child, I thought about suicide, but most of the time I was trying to survive and live. I was in therapy trying to get better, and I relapsed, making one of the worst mistakes a human being can make: betraying someone who wants what's best for them. I think that was the push I needed. I would do anything to go back in time and have fidelity and loyalty as one of the most valuable virtues to prevent all of that from happening, but unfortunately I was immoral, cowardly, and selfish in the worst way. I see genuinely repentant unfaithful people trying to rebuild the lives they themselves ruined; they are trying to live and find meaning unlike me, even those who committed acts of greater disrespect than I did. However, I don't want to be a person who was ever capable of doing any sort of betrayal to someone I was supposed to protect. I will die a virgin, never having kissed, never having felt the human warmth of my lover, because our relationship has always been long-distance. I wish him to feel the sweet embrace and affection of a kind and virtuous woman, unlike me. A selfish bitch who will soon \"catch the bus.\" I'm considering overdosing on my antidepressants I've started taking. I imagine I have 5 packs left, so I'll take all 5 at once and ingest hand sanitizer to see if it increases my chances of dying already.

They must both be integrated into the mind to become whole. A man becomes more emotionally alive by integrating his anima. A woman becomes more self‑directed by integrating her animus.

I’m just afraid of the pain, and the guilt of making my family and friends around me sad (even if they were to get sad) after such a devastating loss. \n\n“How are you ever dream or expect love if you never return it.” This was said by one of my closest friends, who I had a brief fling with. I had feelings for them, but getting such bad feedback from my other friends about our relationship made me cower out. On top of that, I’m not the most affectionate person in the world. I can’t stand pda, kissing. I can bear the occasional hug but cuddling for too long can get overwhelming for me. Shit, I can’t even imagine having sex because I was raped when I was a kid. I don’t even know why they loved me in the first place. I’m the worst.\n\nIt’s been a tug and pull since breaking things off. I don’t want to give them up, see them get with someone who’s better than me. However, I want better for them. What am I to do but to kill two birds with one stone? I’ll just kill myself. I won’t have to worry about the guilt, the pain of being replaced. Then they can go find someone better than me, someone that will give them the proper affection. I won’t have to worry about disappointing my family for doing nothing with my life. I won’t feel the pain of my grief anymore. I’ll get to see my brother again, hold him. We’ll rest together.

I am a biological female (not intersex or transgender) yet for most of my adult life, I have been treated as if I’m less than human. People constantly laugh at me and call me a tranny. \n\nThey call me “sir,” “man,” “boy,” “it,” “thing,” “creature,” as if I am undeserving of basic dignity.\n\nI have always tried to be kind. I go out of my way to smile, to hold doors open, to be warm and polite. \n\nStill, a lot of my pain and sorrow is caused by my workplace. Coworkers secretly record me. They talk about me in group chats. I hear and see everything and pretend I don’t. \n\nWhen I suffered a miscarriage and took a leave of absence for depression, they said I lied—that I made it up—because, “trannies can’t get pregnant.” My grief was turned into a joke.\n\nI wish it were just one job, one environment. But it has followed me from place to place, and sometimes it happens even when I’m just out in public, trying to exist. \n\nI realized, I shouldn’t exist…….\n\nI don’t think I’m fairly unattractive when I look in the mirror. The world thinks otherwise. I do have broad shoulders for a girl, but I’m actually petite. \n\nAt a prior job, I offered to buy lunch for a few coworkers. I caught a coworker saying that they wouldn’t eat anything brought by “a man pretending to be a woman.” This was followed by snickering and giggles. \n\nEventually, I broke down and told my mother how people treat me—how isolated I’ve become, how I’m slowly disappearing from the world. I told her through tears. She laughed. She brushed it aside with empty reassurances about beauty, the kind of meaningless words parents use when they don’t want to face the truth. She made an unattractive daughter. \n\nI have no self-esteem left. No confidence. My life would be so much easier if I could work remotely. But I can’t find a remote job. \n\nEveryday I wake up I am sick to my stomach with anxiety. I have to deal with being lied on, humiliated and treated cruel. \n\nI’ve stopped speaking to my coworkers altogether, and now they spread even more rumors.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how I dress. It doesn’t matter if I wear makeup or that I’m very girlie/feminine. Nothing matters. I am judged, dismissed, and dehumanized before I ever open my mouth.\n\nI am exhausted. I am tired of being treated as less than human. I constantly fantasize about ending my life. I want my first attempt to be painless and successful.,\n\nThe only reason I haven’t done it yet is because I’m trying to put my affairs in order. But as soon as that is done, I will sit in my garage and let my car run. I hope carbon monoxide won’t be slow and painful.
