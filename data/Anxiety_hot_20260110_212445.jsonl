It felt like I didnt know what was reality and what was a dream. My husband drove me to the ER where they gave me lorazepam that helped enough for me to sleep. However every day and night after that im still not able to shake the fear. I feel like I cant get enough air even though my blood oxygen is at 100%. Im terrified of going to sleep so much that at night I stay up as late as I can and then I inevitably wake up an hour or so later heart pounding feeling like I just had a terrible nightmare. I then eventually get back to sleep but only getting about 4-5 hours total. In the mornings I feel weak and so tired but I still have to go to work which I can barely focus on.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Life after a septic kidney stone", "text": "I (30F) don't even know where to begin with this all, but I just know I need to feel less alone. And I take medication (I have diagnosed anxiety - not related to this experience) and have a therapy appointment scheduled for next week, so please know I'm doing everything I can to take care of myself.\n\nAbout 7 weeks ago, I woke up in excruciating back and stomach pain and went to urgent care. I was hit by a car while crossing a crosswalk about 6 years ago, and this back pain was comparable to the 2 bones I broke in my back from that car accident 😅 Urgent care couldn't do any imaging but told me it was likely a kidney stone but they couldn't rule out appendicitis. So I went to the hospital and got a CT scan which showed a 3mm kidney stone. I got me some good pain meds and felt a little better for a bit but then I started feeling absolutely terrible and feverish and went back to the ER. They gave me some fentanyl and a bunch of other shit but ultimately sent me home and told me to drink lots of fluids...but then my fever got worse and I felt like I was going to die. I was cold all over and couldn't stop shaking, and my brain fog was awful. \n\nAfter going back to the ER, they did more tests which showed I had a growing infection. The stone was blocking the flow of urine which was causing bacteria to leak into my bloodstream and spread throughout my body. They admitted me to the hospital, and while I was waiting for a room to become available, I finally fell asleep (filled with more fentanyl and nausea meds). Then, I woke up to my nurse shaking me awake and looking panicked and telling me they're taking me to the OR. My heart rate was 130bpm (I looked at the monitor because it felt like it was going to beat right through my ribs) right when I woke up, and I've never been so scared (again, I've been hit by a car 😅).\n\nAnyway, to fast forward a bit, I had a stent placed and then kept the stent and stone in for a month while the infection cleared with antibiotics. I had a second procedure to remove the stone and stent about 3 weeks ago, and I'm in an extremely abyss level of darkness mentally/emotionally.\n\nI think part of it is because I was sent home from the ER twice even though the second time I had told them I felt really sick and like I had a whole body infection. So now I just don't feel safe and like I'll be taken care of when I'm sick. And the anesthesia really fucked me up because I didn't know if I was going to even wake up from the first procedure, and I imagine death to be like being under anesthesia where it's just absolute darkness. Just a complete abyss.\n\nI was all alone at the hospital without my friends or family, and I thought that could be the end for me. I also woke up with the breathing tube still in the second time which just amplified the feeling of being out of control of my own body. I've tried talking about it all with friends and family and my partner, but I feel like nobody really gets it. I would have died if I hadn't gone back to the hospital the third time, and it all escalated so quickly. I keep getting intrusive thoughts about how nothing matters because we all die anyway.\n\nI'm not suicidal, but this is the emptiest and most lost I've ever felt.

NDRIs are definitely more addictive than SSRI's or SNRI's. The boom of cathinones and pyrovalerones like MDPV, aPVP, aPHP are potent NDRIs, known for being very fiendy and compulsive, because of their potent DAT inhibition and very short acute peak. \n\nThey're notoriously known for being way more addictive than other drugs, especially MDPV.  The profound dopamine release obviously induced tweaking and euphoria, as well as compulsive redosing. \n\nDopamine is also the major component of meth and amphetamine euphoria, as well as opioid euphoria. Obviously a dopaminergic drug is going to be more addictive, more than SSRI's which indirectly suppresses dopamine, that's part of why SSRIs numb libido and may induce emotional blunting and apathy, compared to NDRIs. Every drug of abuse directly or indirectly increases dopamine, therefore every drug of abuse one way or another acts on the reward circuitry. \n\nSSRIs and SNRIs have minimal abuse liability exactly, because they not only don't increase dopamine but indirectly inhibit dopamine via 5HT2C and 5HT1A inhibitory pathways. They're just not recreational for that reason. \n\nDopaminergic stimulants definitely have far higher abuse liability and euphoria than SSRIs and SNRIs. No one snorts SSRIs, but people definitely snort methylphenidate and amphetamines for their dopaminergic euphoria. \n\n&gt;. NDRIs are no more \"addictive\" than other classes of antidepressants to my knowledge\n\nAre you sure? methylphenidate and similar stimulants are not more addictive than antidepressants? antidepressants are not addictive in the first place, because they're not recreational. They cause physical dependence but not the same addiction that a dopaminergic stimulant causes with its euphoria.\n\n&gt;**SSRIs and SNRIs have** ***very low to negligible misuse/addiction liability***  \nLarge clinical and review articles agree that SSRIs and SNRIs are **not associated with drug‑seeking behaviors or reinforcement**, and are *not considered addictive* in the sense used in DSM‑5 and addiction medicine. Discontinuation symptoms can occur (often called *withdrawal*), but this is distinct from addiction because it does not involve compulsive use driven by euphoria or reinforcement\n\n**Bupropion does have** ***documented misuse and abuse potential***  \nBupropion is structurally related to cathinones and has dopaminergic effects, and while it is not as potent or reinforcing as classic stimulants, misuse *does occur*. - [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4162783/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4162783/)\n\nThat's something that rarely shows up with SSRIs or SNRIs. In one analysis, *nearly 11%* of adverse events related to bupropion were coded as misuse/abuse/dependence. This doesn’t mean it’s common, but it does mean it exists, and at rates far above what’s seen with SSRIs/SNRIs.\n\nSSRIs and SNRIs work mainly on serotonin (and norepinephrine for SNRIs), which does *not* directly activate the dopamine reward circuitry that contributes to euphoria and reinforcement.\n\nDrugs that block reuptake of dopamine (like stimulants including methylphenidate, amphetamines, and potent cathinones) directly increase synaptic dopamine in the **mesolimbic reward pathway**, making them much more reinforcing and prone to misuse. Agents like MDPV and pyrovalerones are notorious for this, and are often described as highly compulsive and addictive for precisely that reason.\n\n**NDRIs have demonstrably greater abuse potential than SSRIs/SNRIs** \\- albeit much lower than classical stimulants like amphetamine or cocaine.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "That's why it's recommended to research before starting any medication. SSRI's like many serotonergic drugs, increase serotonin, which indirectly suppresses dopamine, which normally modulates libido, motivation, pleasure, reward and emotional salience. Part of why SSRIs are so effective for anxiety disorders is the emotional blunting they have, decreasing emotional sensitivity, which is helpful in cases of anxiety disorder like GAD.\n\nWhen you have anxiety disorder, your circuits involved in fear and your amygdala, keep sensitizing the fight-or-flight response and neutral stimuli begin triggering stress response when they shouldn't. In that case, SSRIs decrease the sensitivity and threshold, but this also decreases reward and libido sensitivity, because SSRI's increase serotonin all over the brain, not in selective spots. They're selective for serotonin transporter, but not specific regions, like the ones involved in libido.\n\nBasically, in cases of anxiety disorder and anxious depression, the mental issue itself has detrimental effect on libido higher than the medication would have. In that case, despite the libido blunting, SSRIs may still provide a net benefit and improvement in wellbeing and the libido-blunting is not seen as a big problem. Others simply accept the trade of mental wellbeing for libido.\n\nFor someone who doesn't have anxiety as a major component of their issues, SSRI's can be too emotionally blunting and kill libido completely. For them, SSRIs are just too strong and too emotionally sedating.\n\nThere are antidepressants that are less prone to libido issues and should be considered when consulting with a doctor. Bupropion tends to have none or libido enhancing effects in people. SNRI's are less libido-numbing than purely SSRIs, but they still numb it. Mirtazapine is quite libido-sparing, but raises appetite. For someone who feels libido is huge part of their mental wellbeing, a combo of bupropion+mirtazapine is a well known one.\n\nSo it's definitely the SSRI causing this. Benzodiazepines don't tend to increase serotonin or inhibit dopamine enough to blunt libido.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768046955.0, "id": "nyrvpjy", "author": "Rude_Lengthiness_101"}

I have felt for some time she wasn't a right fit for me. I think I need more intensive therapy for people with trauma, while I'm essentially in only talk therapy. Its my first therapist as an adult and it's taken some time for me to realize it isn't working. I recently started couples therapy through her office. I expressed to my couples therapist that I was feeling off about my personal therapist and how she has been handling my therapy (trying to get me to leave my partner, telling me I'm too weak to set boundaries with people in my life, giving absolutely no advice some sessions at all, telling me to just stop being anxious). My couples therapist sympathized with me and I expressed concern and anxiety knowing my private therapist is essentially her boss. She reassured me and told me it was confidential and it wouldn't leave the room/call, and that she would help me find a new therapist. Christmas happened and my therapy was pushed weeks until today.\n\nMy session went normally for about 40 minutes, she allowed me to talk for 40 minutes before interrogating me. I was finished talking about what happened and my therapist said to me \"I could help you but you told \\*other therapist\\* you're uncomfortable with me and what I say about your partner and mother, so I'm not comfortable giving you advice anymore\" she told me my couples therapist told her everything I had mentioned. She also said \"you just talked for 40 minutes about how awful your mother is, i could give you adviice but unfortunately I'm uncomfortable since you have an issue with the things i say\" She then proceeded to gaslight me on things she said about my partner, saying she doesn't have an opinion about people she doesn't know (my partner) but in the past she's called him an asshole and told me to leave him and that he isn't going to get better. Now she's saying she never said that and that everyone can get better. I said that I never mentioned anything to my couples therapist about my mom or what my private therapist says about my family, she said that I was basically a liar and that my couples therapist said the opposite. And that they shared things I told the both of them about my partner.\n\nShe proceeded to schedule me like normal next week and I'm now at home crying and writing this. I've actually never felt more anxious before. It felt like I was going to throw up in the office. \n\nAm I making a big deal out of this?

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Yes you are right, its anxiety,  happens to me as well , funnily enough the right ear only. It normally happens after hearing something loud or grating / screeching on the ear. Uncomfortable although not painful, but popping and strange internal noises, sensitive eardrum. Slight unbalanced light-headedness, a kind of swish swish swish sound if you turn your head, then it stops if you keep your head still. If the loud noise continues then I put my finger in the ear to block it. Within a minute or so it returns back to normal. I also get the swish swish swish on turning the head if I catch a cold or flu with the unbalanced feeling. I call it zoom zoom. Don't know what the proper medical term is, but people know when I say I've got zoom zoom.\n\n\nIt was much worse during my last anxiety state which lasted a few years. Now i'm out of that, although of course anxiety never completely goes away, it still happens occasionally,  usually when i'm stressed about something. What to do about it?\nFirst,  there's nothing wrong with your ear so don't bother getting it checked. Its just that all your senses are heightened when anxious, hearing being one of them. If your doing anything with power tools, WEAR EAR DEFENDERS, because if you keep irritating the eardrum it will make your anxiety worse. For general use, perhaps wear in-ear headphones,  but not connected to anything. This gives you some protection but you can still hear , then take them out whenever you're talking to someone. \n\n\nI'm not sure if this is relevant but I did have a lot of earache as a child until I had surgery to remove adenoids and that grommet thing was put in.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768033691.0, "id": "nyr7d9s", "author": "AussieRules2957"}

I’m writing now because for about a month my anxiety has become severe, constant, and very disabling.\n\nFor years, I’ve had sensations that are hard to explain: my head can feel heavy or very light, my eyes often feel like they’re not keeping up properly, almost like there’s a delay. I frequently get a strange feeling in my head with blurry vision. I also constantly feel “drunk” in a way — not spinning vertigo, but more like nothing ever feels fully stable.\n\nOver the past few weeks, things have gotten much worse. I’ve had palpitations, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. My mother had a heart attack two months ago, and since then I’ve been extremely focused on my heart, which has made my fears much stronger.\n\nI feel unwell all day, every day. I often feel like I could faint or die at any moment, like my body is always on the edge of something happening. This feeling is terrifying and never really goes away. Sometimes it feels like everything is going too fast in my head, like my brain might shut down. Even small sensations, like tingling in my leg, can trigger intense panic.\n\nMy vision really bothers me. I see blurry in the distance, and if I stare at my phone for a while and then look around, everything feels off and very uncomfortable. I don’t feel “out of my body”, but I constantly feel unwell in my head and in my vision. I feel slightly safer when lying down and much worse when standing or moving.\n\nI also have a constant fear — almost an intuition — that I’m going to die. This thought has been there every day for about a month, even though I rationally know my medical tests are normal.\n\nI’ve had many exams over the years: brain MRI, cerebral CT angiography, spinal MRI, ECGs, blood tests, and I’ve seen a cardiologist, neurologist, ENT, and done vision therapy. Everything has always come back normal. On paper that’s reassuring, but mentally it doesn’t stop the thoughts, especially since these tests are spread out over almost 10 years. Only my brain and spinal MRIs are recent (about six months ago). A week ago I went to the ER for palpitations and had an ECG and blood tests, which were normal, but the reassurance didn’t last because no heart ultrasound or CT scan was done.\n\nI really struggle to let go, because it feels dangerous not to pay attention to my body.\n\nI’m posting here to ask if others have experienced similar long-term issues: constant malaise, near-fainting sensations, strange vision, with no medical cause found. I’d really like to hear other people’s experiences and know if anxiety alone can truly cause all of this, because I have a very hard time believing it.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "My year long very physical recovery journey.", "text": "The recovery stories people had posted on Reddit were really helpful to my recovery journey so I want to contribute and hopefully help someone else.\n\nLast year, I had a pretty extreme health scare. I was cleared and sent home, and told to just follow up with a neurologist but they thought it was likely triggered by stress or anxiety. The thing is, I was so shaken by this event I ended up bedridden. I would wake up with my shoulders up to my ears and my jaw so tight opening my eyes was painful. I had unimaginably real pain throughout my body. Urinary issues, muscle spasms, weakness and floppiness. I couldn’t understand how I had so many tests done and they came back fine. It seemed like something was wrong with my brain. So, for the entire day I would stay cooped up on my phone researching health issues. Within the last few months, I had experienced numerous health problems. One of which was vertigo, another was pain in my ears and I was convinced I had some sort of undiagnosed, serious illness.\n\nMy PCP then sent me to vestibular physical therapy. It helped a lot, after the first session I felt a dramatic improvement in my vertigo and overall lightheadedness. I originally thought I was suffering from a condition, but the physical therapist explained to me that my shoulders were tense and my head was locked in an odd position. My vertigo was likely caused by a combination of anxiety and my nervous system being stuck in a loop of fear and worry. That was when I decided I needed to start addressing that maybe these symptoms were a result of my poor mental health. Maybe, my super impressive “drive” and need to always be busy was actually just anxiety.\n\nAfter this, I started researching more about the physical impact of anxiety. My facial pain? It wasn’t a life altering nerve issue it was me grinding my teeth from stress. My floppy arms? I was getting so nervous I would shake and go weak, not a heart attack. My vertigo? Poor posture and a physical response to being outside around people, not broken ears… I even ended up with chronic tension headaches from crappy posture due to stress. \n\nThat is why I want to underscore this post with something my therapist told me: Anxiety can be sneaky because we are usually told it’s a nervy tummy at most. It is not, chronic stress and anxiety can make you very physically sick and the only way to address it is by breaking the loop of worry, dread, and expectations.\n\nWith this in the back of my mind. I became committed to recovery and I did these things:\n\n1. Got professional help from a psychiatrist and a therapist. I did this when I realised the holistic at-home approach of vitamins and meditation wasn’t working. I wasn’t afraid to shop around for a therapist/psychiatrist that I liked and helped me\n\n2. Ate well. Cut out caffeine.\n\n3. Stopped googling symptoms. Took my therapist advice to accept symptoms of anxiety and not fight them. I also uninstalled TikTok. These apps see you engage with content about health scares and keep you on their app (so that you see more advertisements, end up hooked) but showing you more and more. I intend to completely cut out social media to see how this helps!\n\n4. Quit my job. Focused on school.\n\n5. Started medication. I know it is still a point of contention for a lot of people but it was that thing that helped me push myself to get out of bed. It is not something that fixed anxiety or depression, it just helped me commit to my recovery.\n\n6. Started getting regular massages and doing yoga to help with muscle tension. Moving is crucial to recovery. Meditation is also great.\n\n7. Pushed myself to not challenge anxious thoughts, but say “don’t care. Today and tomorrow aren’t guaranteed. I will do what makes me happy”\n\n8. And then pushed myself to alter my internal monologue into something more positive and happy. I can do this, it is rarely ever the end of the world, life is meant to be enjoyed.\n\n9. Let myself be myself. Dressing the way I want, getting a haircut that makes me feel comfortable, stuff like that!\n\nNow, I hope this list helps you a bit, but what I found most helpful was finding myself and discovering what actually gave me meaning in life. I began putting faith into the world, and allowing myself to have less control over my life. When doubt enters my mind, I remind myself that being a kind person and being happy is all I can do. Everything else is out of my control and so I should cherish every moment. I think the main part of recovery is allowing yourself to feel joy and peace by doing things slowly, abandoning the constant need to be doing something/be productive, and enjoying life knowing that it is unpredictable. \n\nAnxiety thrives off of keeping you stagnant, keeping your brain locked up in a cycle of fear. I feel I starved my anxiety by caring for myself and being kind to my mind and body. What makes anxiety so scary is that part of the process of recovery is handing over control to the world and accepting that uncertainty is just a part of life and kind of what makes living so great. I was bedridden with anxiety, there is no exaggeration when I say that. I remember going to the mall and almost fainting from vertigo and nausea from just being around other people. I am now at a stage where I can run to the store if need be or make a spontaneous stop to a friend’s house. I still have a long way to go, but I feel so fortunate to still be here after such a tough battle with my mental health. I hope that if you are in a position where you feel stuck, and recovery especially from the physical symptoms feels never ending that you know you will make it and you will come out of this so strong!  \n", "score": 3, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767992790.0, "id": "1q8kbu8", "author": "Hopeful_Wonder_1167", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q8kbu8/my_year_long_very_physical_recovery_journey/"}
{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Anxiety medication advice", "text": "For some context before I get to the story:\nI was diagnosed with anxiety in September 2021 just over a year before I went through a traumatic experience and made my anxiety worse (which is now stable and I still have days where it's worse). When I was discussing treatment options with my gp he said that he didn't recommend me to go on medication and instead try talking therapy. Which is working and I have improved according to both my gp and psychologist. Especially since I went through trauma (one incident was my grandma's death which was unexpected and unnatural).\nNow here is the story and I think I'm overthinking this (I'm an overthinker). I volunteer at an op shop. Have been since September 2024. I'm there every Wednesday morning and my manager wants to increase my hours. Last Wednesday was my bad day in regards to my anxiety and had my strategy ready in place just in case. I have been having issues with one of my colleague for a while my supervisor knows about it and she gave me advice. (This was a few weeks ago). So the colleague that I have been having issues with came and said hi to me and I was in no mood to talk so I just smiled and nodded and went back to my task. She then came close to me and looked really close to me and said why aren't you talking to me? I said could you please leave me alone I am having a tough day and I already acknowledged you. I said it really professionally and calmly and she went to the back. She then told my manager and my manager came up to me in the middle of the store and spoke to me about it. The other colleague came out of the back and I said to my manager can we please talk in the back. I started crying at this point. I told her everything about my concerns about the other colleague. Instead of helping me she defended the other colleague. Explaining that she is one of my trusted volunteers and how she was a regional manager at a big clothing store and how she wants both of us to stay. Then says you need to go on anxiety medication. This was the second time she told me this. The first time I let it go but this time she crossed a line that she can't uncross. I am so upset. It's been bothering me since Wednesday. I would like your take on this. I don't want to be on medication now as I am improving and I feel like I don't need and I am surviving without it. I am thinking of seeing my gp again and tell him what happened and ask for his opinion. I just wanted to vent and ask for your opinion. Thank you for reading and have a great day!

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Life story of a lonely cat..", "text": "\nFor the past six years, my life has felt like a long test of endurance—one loss after another, one heartbreak piled on top of the previous one.\nIt all began when my grandfather died. His death shattered something inside me that never fully healed. He was my emotional anchor, and losing him felt like losing safety itself. I somehow survived that pain, but it changed me forever. I became quieter, heavier inside, learning how to exist with grief rather than without it.\nJust when I thought life might stabilize after graduation, it collapsed again. I was thrown out of my own apartment—not because of my mistake, but because my uncle mismanaged money and used the apartment to pay off his loans. Overnight, I lost my home. I lost control. I didn’t know where to go or what to do. I had no friends to lean on, no one to hear me. I was completely alone.\nOut of loneliness, I turned to a dating app—not for fun, but for connection, for warmth. That’s when I met a girl who turned out to be toxic. I fell in love blindly, desperately wanting to believe someone could choose me. Later I realized she was trying to honeytrap me into marriage. It broke me to accept that, but leaving her was the hardest and bravest thing I did for myself at that time.\nThen I met another girl from the Philippines. She was only 20. She didn’t understand me deeply, and emotionally she was fragile, always crying. Eventually, it ended—but the end pushed me into depression. I sank so low that even breathing felt heavy. During that time, my brother was the only reason I survived. His support kept me alive when I had nothing left in me.\nAfter that, life didn’t give me rest. I was jobless. For months—three, four months—my family pressured me constantly. Every day felt like a reminder that I wasn’t enough. Somehow, through sheer survival instinct, I found a remote job. For the first time in a long while, I felt hope. I worked honestly, quietly, consistently.\nYears passed. One by one, staff members left the company. I stayed. I became the last one standing. Still, I felt invisible. Stable, but lonely.\nIn 2024, loneliness pushed me to love again. I met a girl who was also depressed because she was jobless. I gave her everything I had—my time, my energy, my emotional strength. I motivated her when she had no belief in herself. I stayed up late listening, encouraging, pushing her forward. After two months, she started getting interviews. Eventually, she landed a remote job at Jack Daniels.\nI was proud of her. Truly.But slowly, the dynamic changed.\nShe started looking down on me because she earned more than I did. The same person who once needed my strength began to see me as less. Still, I loved her. I accepted everything about her—her flaws, her past, her insecurities. But she couldn’t accept me the same way.\nIn December 2025, I had to let her go.Not because I stopped loving her—but because loving her meant losing myself.\nThat breakup destroyed something deep inside me. Since then, life hasn’t just been bad—it’s been unbearable. Every day feels heavier than the last. My family is in chaos. I’m in chaos. It feels like no matter how much I give, how much I endure, how much I try to be strong—life keeps taking without mercy.\nI’m exhausted.I’m hurting.And for the first time, I don’t know how to move forward.\nBut if there’s one truth buried under all this pain, it’s this: I survived things that should have broken me completely.And maybe that means my story isn’t over yet—even if right now, it feels unbearable to continue.\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768019130.0, "id": "1q8uhua", "author": "lxdragneel", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q8uhua/life_story_of_a_lonely_cat/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Hello, that zoned out and autopilot feeling sounds like dissociation. That happens from stress. Anxiety often causes it. It's harmless. It cannot progress into anything. \n\nAnd you can help it. I just explained it to someone, so I can copy it here: You need to understand that at the core it's from having low tolerance of uncertainty. That results in your fight or flight being triggered very easilly. That's what causes anxiety. The anxiety then causes the need to do something about it to make it stop. For example making sure how what you're afraid of isn't going to happen or to somehow get away from what you're afraid of. And when you do that, you further reinforce your low tolerance of uncertainty. It works like addiction. Do you understand the logic of this? It's improtant to understand it.\n\nAnd the radical acceptance technique. That means telling yourself how if what you're afraid of happens, it's fine. As if you don't care. No matter how terrible it would actually be. Being like \"So what?\" about it. This works as outsmarting the fear.\n\nAt all times you should let the feeling of anxiety to come and stay, not try to resist it or distract yourself from it.\n\nAlso it's crucial you get enough sleep regularly, that affects anxiety a lot. Also ideally no caffeine if you drink any.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767994968.0, "id": "nyoajdy", "author": "AntonioVivaldi7"}

Usually after a good panic attack or a significant hit of anxiety the brain protects itself and gives some disassociation and or a heightened level for a while.

I would do your best to keep busy and surrender to whatever it wants to take from you ,which is nothing, you are going to be fine.

Just like when we are having a panic attack we are so scared to avoid anyone seeing we are having one, perhaps you are going through the \"burden\" thing and you really are not. It's life and people who love and care for you show they do in the tough times, that's how you know they are for real. It's easy to be there in the good times, you will be there when they are going through tough times because that's life. Try to focus on good times ahead, keep busy physically doing things to help your brain to just focus on those things. When I am in a spiral I understand it's a process to get to baseline and I get out and go for walks, do things you enjoy that are physical, like painting, gardening...anything like that.

The constant breathing awareness, chest heat, dizziness, weakness, being exhausted even after sleeping, appetite dropping, all of that is super common when your nervous system is stuck on high alert. The mental side too, the fear of death, aging, getting stuck like this forever, suddenly feeling different about games or things you used to enjoy, that’s also very typical anxiety stuff. It doesn’t mean you’ve changed as a person or that something bad is happening to your brain. Anxiety can make you hyper-aware of your body and your thoughts, and once that loop starts it feeds itself.  The fact that reading other posts gives you moments of calm is actually a big sign this is anxiety driven. Anxiety can absolutely feel nonstop for weeks and still calm down, even though it doesn’t feel like it right now. You’re not weak for feeling this, and it doesn’t mean your future is ruined. One small thing that sometimes helps is gently shifting attention back to the present when your mind goes to the “end of the road” thoughts, like noticing what’s around you or what your body is touching.

Literally like 2 days ago I posted in here talking about a mix of health anxiety and the fear of dying in general. A lot of y'all gave good advice and I thought I was gonna do better today but now I'm just thinking like... What if it's literally just lights out? Well, I have a wife who I love and my job is to protect her at all cost, so \"lights out\" for her surely won't do.\n\nThat really hurt me a lot just typing that last sentence man. My God that was PAINFUL. I'd rather be skinned than have to have that thought again...\n\nAnyways, I'm at a loss here. I haven't the slightest idea of what to do. I spend my days going through a mix of grief, extreme anger, and creating scenarios in my head where I can somehow \"protect\" her in the afterlife somehow. \n\nLike I've run it through my head SO many times I'm pretty sure I'm insane at this point. I've got this very very well thought out situation where I die, and return to earth in the spirit world as this giant titan like thing, beating the f*CK out of demons that try to torment my wife and son for the rest of their lives even though they can't see I'm there. \n\nIt actually makes me feel better thinking about it but then I realize it's just some nonsense I made up in my own mind, and in reality, I'm completely powerless.\n\nOne day she will just.... Turn off... And so will I, and our kiddos will suffer for it. I believe In an afterlife but the lack of hard proof just makes me want to consume the entire multiverse out of frustration. Like you have NO idea how ANGRY I get on a daily basis thinking about my inability to stop this from happening. Thinking about my wife's smile and laugh being forever lost makes me want to go full medieval torture on whatever being is responsible for making that decision...\n\nI didn't used to be violent. But thinking about how powerless I am to stop death really does make me want to be violent. Problem is, it's nobodies fault, so there's nobody deserving the level of violence I wish to inflict.\n\nI'm literally shaking, like BAD shaking just typing this out...\n\nThis video basically sums up the vision I have of returning as some kind of monster to kill those MF demons or whatever. I don't know.

This could be greatly improved with professional help IMO.\n\nAlso, I deal with a similar albeit much less intense thing. A big relief for me is making sure I'm prepared, I feel a bit better now that I have life insurance and a will. I know that when I die all of my assets will go directly to my family. I think it's important to work out your preferences with your partner, what level of life support you want in the event something happens. Discussing it openly has helped me a lot too, letting my family know that it's okay to let me go and my feelings towards death. \n\nAfter a few losses I've really figured out what matters to me. I want to spend as much time as possible with my family while they are alive and mentally well, and I want to be there with them through death. There's nothing we can do aside from spend more time with the people we love, and I've found maximizing that genuinely helps. I've cut back on work and video games so I can have more memories with them. \n\nI've prioritized health as well, taking my mom and grandparents to the park to walk and enjoy nature. Also trying to improve healthy cooking to minimize fast food. The reality is modern medicine is fucking incredible, and if you go through all your check-ups and live a generally healthy lifestyle you will have plenty of time with your family.

But for that, you have to abstain from acting on it. Or acting on your anxiety as a whole. So none of the preparing for afterlife or anything. And not doing anything to somehow make sure there isn't anything wrong with your health. It works like addiction. You must abstain and that way slowly get used to uncertainty. That's always at the core of it, not tolerating uncertainty. This way you start tolerating it, slowly resulting in this worrying being weaker and less frequent. \n\nAnd medication might be needed, since it sounds severe.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1767961418.0, "id": "nyl1jxc", "author": "AntonioVivaldi7"}

So insane I had to take several weeks off of work. No, nobody died. I haven't had a family death since I was like 14. I was driving my semi one day and it smacked me in the face. \n\n\"Hey you inconsiderate f*CK, you're wife isn't gonna live forever and sooner or later, one of you will have your heart broken by the others passing. K thx bye\"\n\nAnd I just started sobbing literally while crusing down the highway.

That's basically someone who assumes they have every fatal disease in the book. Example, I had some lower left abdominal pain that comes and goes depending on my diet and occasionally a bit of back pain that's forgettable.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "I’ve been in your same seat, at almost the same age so you’re not alone. I had terrible health anxiety and panic attacks for maybe 2 years and all of the advice around therapy and reframing are correct. I also second that the book DARE (and app) really helped me when I was at my absolute worst (3+ panic attacks every day for over 6 months and almost complete insomnia).\n\nI would say I’m now cured and am living a normal life with just regular mild anxiety. A few additional things to consider: your microbiome and general health. In my case, I was on a lot of antibiotics which I realized after the fact is what started my extreme anxiety. When your microbiome is disturbed, it can cause extreme anxiety and depression (the gut brain connection) which was absolutely the case for me. I started (and continue) to have 1 Greek yogurt per day no exceptions. When I find my mental health suffering, most of the time it’s when I’m off my regimen. \n\nThe second is your general health. I went to my doctor and got a full blood workup, and found my Vitamin D and Magnesium were DANGEROUSLY LOW! I took a Magnesium supplement that afternoon and felt almost instantly 25% better. So in addition to the yogurt I take a daily multivitamin religiously.\n\nLastly, exercise. In the peak of my anxiety and insomnia I was maybe only able to sleep a couple hours a night. I ended up forcing myself to get out of bed and exercising every day, even just 15-20 minutes of yoga and ate a healthier diet. That way even when you’re in a midst of panic you know you’re taking care of your body the best you can.\n\nYou’ve got this, and you will eventually become cured and feel better. ❤️\n\nEdit: I also second medication. I got a very low Xanax prescription I’d take when a panic attack set it and it really helped.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "The issue is obsessive thoughts that are providing very small (and I mean negligibly small) satisfaction, either through the mind relishing in its own powers of observation, or through its predictive powers of harm detection. A mind is a beautiful, wonderful, powerful thing, and, especially when given limitless time to ruminate, will create cavernous realms of fantasy and imagination. Normally most thoughts don't affect people on an emotional level because the thoughts aren't deep and they are quickly replaced by real-world events. However, for sensitive people (which it sounds like you are), it can be an upsetting phenomenon when you fixate on a painful idea or memory. \n\nI have two suggestions to help deal with this. First, try not to let your imagination wander (called maladaptive daydreaming). If you have to drive for work, listen to podcasts or music. Second, try to learn how to avoid repeated examination of something that is causing you pain and outside of your control. Your eventual death is inevitable and should, ideally, not be causing you grief while you are still alive and, indeed in the prime of your life. It's OK to worry about things. When that worry stops being commensurate with the benefit it's providing, that's when it's time to stop and simply let it go as something beyond your control.\n\nAs others have mentioned, an SSRI can also help with obsessive thoughts. You're a sensitive guy, like me, which is a good thing and the world needs more of that. But too much sensitivity is not good for anyone.

Sometimes it's about something that could happen right now, something in the future, or even just thinking about life and death in general. I also desperately searched for a way to believe in an after life, and I also felt like I was making myself absolutely insane (yet not insane enough lol).\n\nI'm 21, and though I don't have everything completely figured out, something that I highly recommend looking into is a therapy called ACT. If you are having trouble changing the way of thinking, or the thoughts pop into your head no matter what else you are doing, this type of therapy has been exponentially helpful for me. I also agree with other's suggestions that it may be helpful to try a medication like an ssri or snri, it's something you can bring up to a doctor. \n\nGive yourself things to do, when the fear is paralyzing, when you can, plan an activity and do it. Spend time with your wife and make your #1 goal to feel the present moment. Life is both endless and very short, but whatever happens, however it happens, once it's happened then that is exactly what was meant to happen.

If that's to appreciate the colour of the car ahead of you, or think about dinner plans when you get home, whatever you think you'd like to focus on experiencing. It won't necessarily change how things are right away, but creating distance between fears of the maybes and the what ifs and whens, noticing that that is separate from the reality right now can be very very helpful in being able to enjoy and appreciate the moment you are actually experiencing at the time those thoughts come up! \n\nI'm wishing you the absolute best, keep on pushing for a way to work with your thoughts to feel the experience of life and love you have right now :)", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767923624.0, "id": "nyin0gz", "author": "Mother-Expression-16"}

Just try to live in the moment and if anything major health wise does come up, you can face it then. As for the afterlife thing, I don’t fear death like I used to because I know there is life after death, in a place where there will be no more anxiety, no more aches, no more pain.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Hi. M23 here.\n\nI\"ve kinda had the same experience.\n\nNote I have been suffering from panic attacks and anxiety for a couple years now.\n\nThe first time, my FIRST panic attack was triggered by a mix of health anxiety and derealization episodes. I felt a weight on my chest, felt like I couldn't \"fully breathe\". I was at a birthday party, I was talking to a friend of mine, and suddenly I sort of \"became aware\" that I was alive, idk how to explain that, and began panicking so much that I had to go outside and catch my breath while a friend tried to reassure me. Like there was a monster in the room all the time.\n\nGot diagnosed with anxiety and panic attacks and got started on citalopram. It saved me. Took it for a year, fully, 20mg per day. Then (surely a mistake) at the beginning of 2025 I began tapering off as I knew that with SSRIs you CANNOT go cold turkey. So I started taking 6x week instead of 1x day, after a month 5, after two months 4, when I felt that I was having some strange sensations I went up to 5, and so on. In May / August I was off of them and felt good.\n\nOccasionally I would find myself panicking or being anxious because of crowded places, of highways, etc. Nothing that couldn't be reversed with me thinking \"alright, it's just a panic attack\". Well. On Christmas evening I ate with my girlfriend and her parents, then we went to sleep. And it started again. Weight on my chest, accelerated heartbeat, \"empty\" breathing, anxiety, sensation of impending doom, and fear. Because I thought that I was lowkey going insane. That night I slept, and the next morning it was ALL the same. The whole fucking day. Couldn't eat, couldn't think straight.\n\nThen it was time to go home and my gf drove me home. Halfway there I had the WORST panic attack of my life. I called the emergency service as well as I thought I was having a heart attack. I came back home to my parents crying as I didn't know what was happening. The next three days were hell. Couldn't leave my bed, couldn't eat, couldn't do shit. \n\nIt was like a switch was turned on in my head. As if everything around me felt strange, as everything was unreal, especially my parents and my close ones. Imagine living with a sensation of dread the whole day.\n\nDay 3 I threw up. Day 4 I called an ambulance to pick me up cause I felt I had no other options. Ran an ECG, everything was fine, had a talk with the hospital doctor, she told me to start citalopram again.\n\nDays of hell. Then I went to my doctor. She told me that I am depressed, that I need to continue taking citalopram and Xanax drops as well 3x/day until the ssris started kicking in. Since then I feel fairly better. Day 14 of Citalopram I no longer have panic attacks (for now) and can do some things during the day. I eat kinda the same amount of food I ate before *even though a bit less, mind that I lost 3kg because of that week where I ate straight air*, I walk the dog, I do stuff at my PC, etc.\n\nI know that SSRIs take a while to kick in and that the timeline can be different for anybody, but I think the meds are helping me a lot.\n\nToday has been the best day so far. It took me a while to get out of bed, but then I immediately sat at my pc and did something to keep my mind busy. I ate something, and then I walked the dog. It was a sunny and clear day, and I felt happy when I was outside. An emotion now rare because right after I have a moment of happiness, I think about the same things that bother you. \"It'll end anyway.\", \"It can end anytime\", \"What's the point\", etc. Especially the first days, when the SSRIs had their \"initial rebound effect\".\n\nI think the context I lived in had a lot to do with this. During the last year i lost interest in going to uni, even though I'm in last year. I lost my part time job (where there was a toxic environment) because the place closed up, so now I am unemployed and not finishing my studies. I have been trying to start a personal project with trading for a year now, have seen some results (I have two funded accounts) but haven't got a payout yet. Ofc I worry about being a weight on the shoulders of my parents, I feel like I'm useless at times because I'm obsessed with being productive. But right now I understand (or at least I try to) that I am on a path of healing from possibly years of suppressed anxiety and traumas.\n\nEveryday I feel slightly better, even though it comes and goes \"in waves\".\n\nTo that thought of yours I say I feel you and understand you. It's NOT easy, but I think appreciating the small things and focusing on the present moment might help. I try to tell that myself when I'm feeling blue. I like to think that my purpose is to make my family and my close ones happy, and maybe one day, help people around the world.\n\nGood luck to you friend.

If your kid remained 6 forever, the definition of “my six year old child” would change for you over time, if you remained 26 forever, your mind would shatter and collapse on itself eventually, because the working principle of the biology itself assumes aging and mortido.\n\nif your family and current life, was something you’ve worked hard towards, cherish, and was sort of like a milestone, it can turn into one of those things, that you strive for, and once you get there, or close, all of that energy gets misdirected from “chasing the dream” to “not lose what was achieved” .\n\nPersonal experience (optional read) when I was 21, I was doing 80 on a motorcycle, at midnight, blinding rain and risky winds, in hindsight I was kinda asking for it, but I had years of experience to rely on for everything that could go wrong… except a fucking stray dog lunging out of a bush at the exact fucking time I passed it, essentially t boning me.. never in a million years could I have foreseen getting t boned by a fucking dog while flying down the highway at midnight… I survived, and that was the oddity, I shouldn’t have, I had zero protective gear on, not even a helmet. I have friends who died going the speed limit in broad daylight because they happened to fall at an angle that was fatal, I survived because I didn’t. \nYou can control every single variable and still get fucked over, which should make you realize it’s not about controlling every single variable.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "So I have 2 totally different age/situational POVs to share that I hope might help you find some peace. First of all, my mother was a hypochondriac, and I strongly suspect she had Munchausen syndrome, which she used my brother Jimmy to get attention, so that was fun growing up, having my grandma come WALK to \"pick me up\" at Junior High to tell me \"mom was in the hospital \"again\"! Jimmy was non-verbal and had Down's syndrome. I'm now 65 and still alive! I've watched my dad die of congestive heart failure (although cigarettes, a terrible diet, and basically being \"underinsured\" meant the doctors basically let him die at only 64 years old (yeah, try living to a year older than the year your dad died!) because his unsurance wouldn't pay for the triple bypass I later watched my ex-husband and his father receive! They were all smokers, too. I have never smoked, but have had terrible respiratory problems during flu season, since I'm a Special Education Teacher and around kids a lot. I've had Bronchitis several times, pneumonia 3 times, and COVID once. The first time I had Bronchitis, I was only 18, and I missed a lot of fun stuff in my senior year, and that was the first time I thought I was going to die! I wrote my will.                                                                                                           \n\nI am older myself now, and watching my ex-husband, John, die at only 54  was awful (who I married at 18 and was married to for 18 years, so we still loved each other). We had a daughter who is the light of my life, along with my 2-year-old grandson. But I also lost my mom in 2010, John in 2012, my brother in 2013, and the cousin I was like a sister to in 2022. I feel like I'm playing the scariest, most terrifying game of musical chairs sometimes, and I'm the only one still here! \n\nBut seeing my son-in-law survive after being born with PKD (a chronic kidney disease), and go through his battle with getting his 2nd transplant at only 33 years old, as well as surviving Stage 4 Lymph Cancer that he got because of the immunosuppressant drugs and being on dialysis and Chemo at the same time during 2020! That was scary as hell! I asked him if he believed in God (which I used to, but now I just don't know), and he said no, but he still had hope. Branden is my example of how to be a real man! He and my amazing daughter fought through all his illnesses, and he never wants sympathy. He is such a sweet, loving dad. And my daughter went through so much to be a mom (including IUI treatments because Branden had fertility issues until he got his transplant). They are both incredible parents! And my grandson, Dylan? He is a little miracle in himself! After thinking they couldn't have a child with Branden's health problems, and using donor sperm, guess what? Six months after his transplant, Katrina was pregnant the old-fashioned way! \n\nLife is often shitty, and then you die. So you might as well enjoy the ride! Travel, spend time at the beach. Notice the fall colors and the fresh air. Go hiking in rainforests and waterfalls. Go to Hawaii (I lived there for 5 years and visited the Napali coast, and all the main islands). Go to Rome, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, the Columbia Gorge, and any place that makes you gasp with wonder at the beauty of nature. But most of all, spend time with your family, because sooner or later, it WILL really be \"Your turn\" to go. None of us gets out of here alive. Death is at the end of the road for us all. But we MUST enjoy our lives while we can and be grateful for all that we have right here, right now. Today is all any of us have! Much love! \n\nThe old lady!

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "You've probably seen a doctor or two about this but maybe not the right one or maybe not the right tests. Sometimes anxiety happens with an endocrine disorder. Sleep disorders also which initially cause anxiety then a couple of years later, fatigue sets in. \n\nOne can still have sleep apnea or UARS even if trim and fit, even if sleeping the usual 7 hours. Anyone would begin to lose it with getting less oxygen during sleep. Or just restless legs syndrome, there are a few sleep disorders causing an unrestorative sleep. It's even possible to get schizo like symptoms but not true schizophrenia if this goes on too long untreated. Sleep is the time for the brain to repair and restore itself. \n\nMore trouble mornings with both endo and sleep disorders and anything medical really because cortisol is the highest the first hour of the day (it begins to rise half way through sleep). Easier to feel nervous and pace. Cortisol is the lowest at night, but with some conditions, the mind races before bed since it's more difficult to fall asleep and really, the body becomes afraid to fall asleep knowing what's going to happen. REM, the dream stage is when we work out daily stress too. \n\nCortisol is the stress hormone, more adrenaline too happens when it's high. Lofta at home but an in-clinic sleep study is better to catch all sleep disorders. Endocrine full panel blood tests. Many PCPs and family doctors don't consider sleep disorders. Many doctors only do TSH blood tests not the full thyroid panel (also there is cortisol, ACTH, etc). A heart holter monitor is worth trying if you're older since cardiac reasons happen more. Smart watches are not really accurate for heart, oxygen levels, sleep patterns but a clue.   \n\nWith any anxiety reason, small problems become magnified and harder to cope with; but, it's a good idea to explore more physical body medical reasons first before jumping to a mental health disorder. Talk therapy helps to cope in the meantime. \n\nGood luck with your investigations and path to recovery!", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767986440.0, "id": "nynfr5o", "author": "erika_nyc"}

Continuity only matters to an observer who remembers the break and in no way would our memories survive the death of the brain anyway, which I view as a blessing actually.

All my tests are normal.\nI’ve seen a lot of doctors, but still don’t have a clear answer, so I’m looking for people with similar experiences.\n\nMain symptoms:\n\n- constant thirst\n\n- dry mouth and dry lips\n\n- feeling like water doesn’t really quench my thirst\n\n- because of that, I drink a lot (around 4–4.5 liters / ~1–1.2 gallons per day), which leads to frequent urination\n\n\nSleep is a separate issue.\nI fall asleep easily, but about 4 hours after falling asleep I wake up, probably because of thirst and the need to go to the toilet. The problem is that I don’t fully wake up. I stay in this half-awake, very shallow sleep state until morning. By the time I’m actually awake, it’s already time to get up.\nAs a result, I don’t get proper, restorative sleep, and this has been going on for many months. It’s really exhausting.\n\nWhat doctors and tests have ruled out:\n\n- diabetes mellitus\n\n- kidney issues (ultrasound + labs are normal)\n\n- electrolyte imbalances (but recently I learned that test results can be normal, yet someone may still benefit from additional electrolytes, so I'm experiment with that) \n\n- autoimmune causes\n\n- endocrinologists consider diabetes insipidus clinically unlikely\n\n\nSo basically, no organic cause has been found despite long-term testing.\n\nOver the past 10 years, I’ve had similar episodes of constant thirst and frequent urination before. But back then, they didn’t last long, didn’t affect my sleep, and went away on their own.\n\nAt this point, all doctors keep referring me to psychotherapists, saying it’s related to anxiety, stress, nerves, etc.\n\nSince about a year I've actually been going through an existential crisis and depression, and since around that time these symptoms appeared and have been gradually intensifying month by month.\n\nI’ve seen two psychotherapists so far. Both say this is a somatoform disorder related to anxiety and depression. At the same time, they openly admit that they haven’t had patients with exactly the same presentation as mine, which honestly makes me less confident in the treatment plans they suggested.\n\nThe first doctor prescribed: Gidazepam (anxiolytic / benzodiazepine tranquilizer) + Quetiapine (atypical antipsychotic).\n\nThe second doctor prescribed: Phenazepam (benzodiazepine tranquilizer) + an SSRI antidepressant.\n\nI’ve heard about the risks of dependence and withdrawal with these meds. And since I’m a bit of an anxious / cautious person already, plus the fact that these doctors don’t have direct experience with cases like mine, I’ve been hesitant to start taking them.\n\nFinding a really good doctor is difficult in my city, it’s always been a problem here. That’s why I'm here. Sometimes I get more helpful advices on the internet than from docs. \n\nI’d really like to hear from people who’ve been in a similar situation.\n\nWas anxiety or stress actually the root cause for you?\n\nDid you try antidepressants or anti-anxiety meds?\n\nWhat helped you specifically?\n\n\nI’d really appreciate any shared experiences.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767961377.0, "id": "1q86vxh", "author": "danick_bmf", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q86vxh/constant_thirst_normal_test_results_32m/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Performance anxiety triggers your nervous system into fight or flight. The shaky voice and breathlessness happen because your body floods with adrenaline and cortisol, preparing for a threat, even though the \"threat\" is just speaking in class. When anxiety is manageable outside of school, that points to context-specific triggers. The classroom environment itself activates survival responses, likely because past experiences involved judgment or embarrassment. Your body remembers even if you don't consciously recall specifics. The anticipation is often worse than the actual moment. The pit in your stomach grows as your brain replays worst-case scenarios and your nervous system stays activated. The pit in your stomach grows because your brain is replaying worst-case scenarios and your nervous system stays activated waiting for the perceived threat. Distraction works in the short term, but it doesn't address the underlying activation. Grounding techniques help when you notice the anxiety building: focus on physical sensations (feet on floor, hands on desk), name five things you can see, four you can touch. This pulls attention away from the mental spiral and signals safety to your body. For participation anxiety, prepare something brief beforehand. Have a few go-to responses ready so you're not caught off guard. Practice saying them out loud at home so your voice doesn't feel foreign when you speak in class. Start small: answer one question per class, even if it's just confirming something. Each time you participate without disaster, you're retraining your nervous system that the classroom is safe. Medication can help if the anxiety is severe enough to interfere with learning, but therapy that addresses the specific triggers is often more effective long term. Many people find that working through performance anxiety requires addressing the underlying beliefs about judgment and failure. There are structured methods for processing these fear responses that can help separate the anxiety from your identity and reduce the physical activation over time.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767945966.0, "id": "nyk7f7b", "author": "zakhere78"}

I even encountered people with anxiety and they told me the same thing “get over it”.\n\n\n Several years ago I was diagnosed with OCD and GAD additionally MDD. These past two-three years it seemed like I developed a social phobia and I’ve isolated myself from the outside world. I’ve been anxious since I was a small child but it progressively worsened through my teen years and now as an adult I’ve completely shut myself from the world.\n\n\n Sometime ago I used to see a psychiatrist, and they prescribed me all sorts of medication to improve my depression, anxiety, etc. I had my dosage increase, I switched to another medication because it felt like the previous one wasn’t effective. At some point it felt like it made my mental health worse so I quit.\n\n\n One day I decided to attend a class at my local community college to improve my “anxiety”, it was a small and quiet campus but every morning I woke up I would feel anxious, sometimes I would jolt up in a panic. I would feel nauseous during my morning routine which I tried to keep low pressure. During the lecture I would start dissociating and I end up not actually gaining any information. \n\n\n A while back I decided to walk around an outdoor shopping mall and I just zone out walking aimlessly.

She told me that I have to try new things and get out of the house.\n\n\nI’m worried that it will worsen my depression being in an environment that is overwhelming.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Hello, \n\nThis sounds pretty much exactly what I deal with on a daily basis nowadays. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression over ten years ago now, and I’ve always had some related health anxiety that causes me to spiral and be hyper aware of every sensation in my body.\n\nI don’t have all the answers, but I can tell you that lots of people feel like this. It’s absolutely exhausting having all these symptoms and your bloodwork comes back normal, and the doctor just says it’s “just anxiety” and you’re young and fine.\n\nThings that have helped (but not a cure.)\n1. Mindfulness meditation, acceptance and commitment therapy. I mean this mostly helped at the time I did it. I’m guessing if you made mindfulness a part of everyday it would be more effective.\n2. Group therapy, individual talk therapy, addressing some of the underlying emotional issues and things in my life that made me this way. It of course can be partially genetic, but I’ve had some circumstances in my childhood etc and other unresolved issues with my family that I guess manifested themselves in this way.\n3. Lifestyle changes. I’ve had to quit smoking, I’ve tapered off my antidepressant, and I’m learning to cope on my own. For some people this might mean getting on medication. It might mean excercising, or joining a social group.\n4. Social interaction, having a routine. \n5. Knowing your limited and setting boundaries. Personally, I need to know what to expect from a given day. I’ve always been willing to do whatever it takes to get way more work done at my jobs in a day than I ever should have, and I’ve burnt myself out multiple times because I took pride. It’s incredibly hard to manage your anxiety and symptoms when you’re burnt out, even if usually accomplishing lots of stuff makes me feel “good” because I can tune out what my body is telling me.\n\nI needed to learn to rest and relax. I’m still working on it tbh. It’s likely different for everyone, but I think I can safely say It can get better again.\n\nWhen you’re having a moment of intense anxiety and symptoms and body sensations are popping up all over, that’s when I do things like \n1. Drinking water\n2. Breathing excercises, or progressive muscle relaxation\n3. Maybe not ideal but I’ll just give in and lay down and rest, either until it passes.\n\nIf the symptoms are really bad and you’re just absolutely terrified or have impending doom or are worried for your life, I would either call a crises mental health line, or go to an urgent care and explain the symptoms. You may or may not want to say it’s anxiety because sometimes then they’ll assume it is in my experience. I’ve only done this twice when i wasn’t sure if it was actually something or anxiety, but at least then I was just sitting in a waiting room, they took my blood pressure and triaged me, and if it WAS something I was in a place where I would get help quickly, and if it wasn’t, worst case I wasted my own time sitting waiting and talked to a doctor or a counsellor for five minutes.\n\nSorry this is so long, I hope it can help a bit.", "score": 21, "created_utc": 1767856759.0, "id": "nycx8rx", "author": "DarkInternational228"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Hi, sorry to hear you are going through this.\n\nOne thing about anxiety is that it can completely trick your mind, and there's often little you can do to override it with logic!\n\nHowever, here's some things you can do to help convince yourself that you're really okay:\n\n1) Take your temperature.  If it shows up below 100, it is unlikely you have any kind of moderate-or-worse viral illness.\n\n2) Get a pulse oximeter.  Ignore the pulse reading, as your pulse will go high when you are anxious (which is fine in the short term).  But read the oxygen level.  If it's 95+, you are fine, and shouldn't worry about the dizziness.  Note that it might be lower than 95 if you live in a high altitude place, in which case don't worry about a low reading.  (I once took it on top of a 14,000 foot mountain for fun, and it showed 81!)  Also give it 60 seconds to stabilize.\n\n3) If you do not have bad diarrhea, you likely do NOT have any kind of stomach bug.  So don't let the nausea scare you.\n\n4) Be aware that almost nobody under 40 has heart attacks out of the blue, unless they have a major hereditary issue they're likely already aware of.  I don't know your age, but if it's under 40, you can assure yourself that your heart \"symptoms\" are just in your head, and that your chances of having a real heart problem are almost zero.  (This is a little more challenging for me, as I am well over 50!)\n\n5) You mentioned that playing a game on your phone will push out the symptoms temporarily.  Good idea!  That works for me, too.  In fact, try playing games which require a lot of thinking or constant action on your part, as your brain will become occupied with that, and will force out all or most of the anxiety.\n\nGood luck!", "score": 4, "created_utc": 1767874420.0, "id": "nydvgs5", "author": "funto99"}

It didn't disappear overnight, but once my body learned I wasn't in danger, the intensity slowly reduced.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767905239.0, "id": "nygvxkk", "author": "Independent-Cod-4086"}

But for the last several years, I’ve had an intense fear of seizures and neurological illness, and recently it relapsed hard.\n\nMy brain hyper-monitors every sensation: smells, déjà vu feelings, lightheadedness, stomach sensations, muscle twitches, fatigue, zoning out — anything. The moment I notice something even slightly off, my mind immediately jumps to “this must be a seizure,” “this is the start of something neurological,” or “something is wrong with my brain.” It turns into spiraling panic, constant reassurance seeking, doom scrolling, and mentally checking myself all day long.\n\nI’ll be having a normal moment — driving, resting, working, hanging with family — and suddenly my brain hijacks the moment with fear. Even when I feel calm, my mind tells me the calm itself is suspicious. I constantly feel like I’m waiting for something bad to happen even though there’s no evidence that it ever will.\n\nWhat makes it harder is that anxiety itself creates physical symptoms, and then I panic about the symptoms, which creates more symptoms. It’s a vicious loop that feels impossible to shut off once it starts. I’ve also recently quit nicotine and caffeine which I know is making my nervous system extra sensitive, but my anxious brain still tries to turn everything into a medical emergency.\n\nI don’t actually want reassurance that I’m dying or sick — I want my life back. I want to stop living inside my body 24/7. I want to enjoy moments without scanning myself for danger. I’m exhausted from being in fight-or-flight all the time.\n\nIf anyone else struggles with health anxiety, especially neurological fears, I’d love to hear what helped you break the cycle or calm your nervous system.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "honestly, i don't really have any good tips besides just ride out the feelings. the rule of thumb i've heard is if it's an actual emergency, the physical sensations will worsen over time instead of improving (most of the time with anxiety, it improves even if it comes in waves). on a podcast i listened to, one of them said \"your body will know when it's an emergency because you won't be questioning if it's an emergency or anxiety\". i can't tell you that that logic works for everyone, but i usually just focus on my breathing (gives me something specific to focus on instead of the feelings im feeling, even if my breathing sucks in the moment) and give myself like 10-15 minutes to sit on the feeling to see if it improves or not. if it's a recurring feeling, i will usually message my doctor (who knows i have health anxiety) to just notify her of the symptoms im feeling, and worst case she will order blood work or ask me to come in just to double check things. the urge to go to the ER is so strong, i almost went back in the summer when i was having panic attacks pretty much daily, but my mom kept telling me i was crazy and that i would be taking aware care from people who actually need it which now makes me not want to go anywhere near the hospital, even when i don't feel the greatest. i hope going back on your meds helps your brain figure itself out a little easier 🤍", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767956595.0, "id": "nykr2f0", "author": "Upbeat_Cress2446"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Heart Palpitations", "text": "Hello everyone. Sorry in advance for asking questions that have probably been asked many times.\n\nI am 25M and have dealt with mental health problems for as long as I can remember. This is not really surprising to me as mental health issues are very common within my immediate family and seemingly from quite a bit of my extended family on both parents sides. I deal with what is in my opinion considered pretty extreme anxiety, as well as bad depression and panic issues. These issues have always impacted my life heavily, but it wasn't until about 5 years ago, shortly after turning 20 that everything took an abrupt turn that causes my life to be completely taken over by my mental health struggles. I'm not going to type out every mental and physical symptom I have had/have to deal with on a daily basis as that would make this an extremely long post. I know a lot of us in this group unfortunately have their own lists that seem to go on forever. \n\nSo the turning point started in early 2021, I was up playing video games way too late as I have always had bad insomnia issues, it had to of been around 3 or 4am. I will say I was playing some intense video games and all of a sudden I started to feel very weird, and for some reason I went to check my heart(that was not a typical thing I did) and I felt nothing. I am quite a skinny guy so usually I can always feel my heartbeat very well. When I had my hand on my chest and felt nothing it was like I was instantly paralyzed in fear, and then all of a sudden my whole body kind of jerked and I could feel my heart rate again and it skyrocketed to insane speeds. It's hard to fully remember everything about that night but I felt like I was dying, and thought I was. I proceeded to have what would best be described as a panic attack with extreme heart rate, frequent skipped beats, and at times my heart rate seeming off rhythm for almost a week straight without stopping. I could barely get out of bed to use the bathroom. With time I was able to function again but the heart palpitations have never stopped. That is what this post is primarily about as I'm extremely worried about my heart health and still after all these years am convinced I have serious heart problems. \n\nI'm aware I should've gone to a cardiologist years ago when this all started, but at the time covid was at it's peak and I didn't want to go to a hospital, as well as my mom convincing me it was just anxiety and it would go away with time. With the issues continuing and putting off going to a hospital, it made me deathly afraid of getting checked out so I still have never been to a docdoctor. For the past year or so I have overcame that fear to the point that I want to get checked out, but have not had health insurance. I have gone in to an urgent care once where they ran an ekg and said nothing seemed off on that but referred me to go to a cardiologist for further testing. Without insurance though I was not able to actually see the specialist. I have finally just gotten insurance yesterday through my new job and will be setting up some appointments but I also am aware that getting in to see a cardiologist can sometimes take months so I'm hoping someone can ease my mind and help convince me something isn't seriously wrong, well other than with my mental health or course lol.\n\nI deal with palpitations on a daily basis,  ranging from minor little ones I barely feel to intense ones that seem to rock my chest and make me cough and jolt. In the past 5 years I've had maybe a few days palpitation free. What worries me the most is what seems to cause the palpitations. They can happen from absolutely nothing, but they also seem to happen from physically exerting myself anytime I try to, and very often from very minorly physically exerting myself such as walking a short distance(10 minutes) or lifting a small ammount of weight(30 pounds). I have not ran or done any serious exercise since all of this started as it terrified me. What also seems to cause them is certain positions, leaning back too much causes them almost every time. Also laying on my left side causes them. I can lay on my back most of the time, but even then I have to lay on my right side for a little while first. Laying on my right side seems to be the only safe option most of the time. When I first lay down I also have to have my head elevated more than typical for the first 10 or so minutes, then it is usually is okay. I also can't bend over without having bad palpitatiojs most of the time. This has made life extremely difficult. What convinced my brain that the palpitations themselves aren't from my mental health issues are that physical exertion cause them and also the specific positions that cause them every time. They are terrifying as I know they are for a lot of people, and I get the violent ones very very often. If these things can truly be caused by anxiety then how do specific positions cause them? I know this all probably sounds very stupid, but I am currently in kind of a freakout mode. I have also probably left a lot out as my mind is jumbled but I will answer any questions people have.\n\nI'm sorry for how long this post is and I thank anyone for sharing their thoughts/knowledge.

My heart’s feeling like it’s beating out my chest almost 24/7 and I’ve gone to the ER for it like 5 times in the past year and a half. Every time they told me my heart was fine despite my heart rate being high af. Your heart rate is usually not something that triggers doctors to worry. Especially if your EKG came back fine you’ll be ok.\n\nPoint is that the mind is powerful and since those of us with Health anxiety are ultra aware of every single sensation with our bodies we go out looking for something that could be wrong with us. Truth is that we’re tricking our nervous systems into thinking something is wrong when it really isn’t.\n\nConsidering you’ve seen doctors and told you that ur fine it’s best to trust them even tho it seems impossible to believe that your ok. \n\nDon’t really have much advice other than that tho cuz I regularly struggle with health anxiety and palpitations but know that ur not the only one that’s felt these symptoms.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "Hi, I’ve had a similar story. I actually went to dental school. I’m a dentist in Missouri. And I started having a heart palpitations after dental school due to high anxiety and overstimulated stress in addition to taking too many monster energy drinks, diet, Mountain Dew‘s and coffees and not enough water no sleep three hours a night studying for tests that never end so it definitely was stress and anxiety that created a perfect storm along with a lack of sleep, but then you ask yourself. How do you get sleep when you can’t get your heart to calm down first things first make sure to see the heart specialist to make sure you don’t have any weak valves or any extenuating stretchy blood vessels that can cause complications second know that if you get good anxiety medicine, it will help the palpitations if it’s purely anxiety third make sure to be drinking a water amount that is beyond what you think is the right amount like literally drinking a jug of water a day is not enough because all the electrical imbalance is in your heart, require water and proper sodium potassium and calcium to effectively balance the channels that caused heart contraction making sure you have enough for electrolytes such as Gatorade actually is really important because that has to do with heart contraction next if your heart structure is healthy after seeing your specialist make sure to do a good amount of weightlifting and Biking to strengthen your heart that will reduce the palpitations. That’s why when you get palpitation some doctors will tell you to bear down like you’re trying to use the restroom and really pressure your heart such as if your weightlifting have your weights but only do this if you’ve checked out that there’s no weak heart structures when you’ve talk to your specialist last make sure to cut out all major, stimulants, energy drinks, nicotine caffeine weed, vaping anything that can stimulate the electrical portion of your heart. Also keep in mind Covid with or without the vaccine and the vaccine both have been known to cause palpitations so if it’s either of those things, they should actually improve overtime and then they’ll come back again when you get sick or something stimulates the spike proteins from either Covid or the vaccine that is supposed to mimic Covid but it will get better than the more you exercise and balance out electrolytes water, and sleep better. it will get better. Also make sure to pray and spend time with God asking him for clarity and peace and what avenues to take for improving the palpitations medically spiritually physically mentally. Whatever you do don’t lose. Hope you will find an answer.

It has always been manageable though. however, in september I had an anxiety attack the morning after drinking heavily, which I know is common, but it was my first SCARY attack. i drank some water and was back to normal. fast foward, to december 17th, i started to feel ‘off’. it got worse by the 20th, and i ended up having the WORST anxiety attack of my entire life. ( no i was not drinking prior to the 17th, i have no idea what ‘triggered’ this ) the panic was deep in my gut, I felt like i just wanted to die rather than live like this and that was a terrifying new feeling for me. this was 100x what i felt in september. my mom took me to the hospital and they ran blood tests, everything came back normal.. ive been drinking water like crazy, and the days ARE getting better… but. I STILL feel ‘off’. been having depersonalization, random fast heartrates then it stops, jaw clenching… I still dont feel completely normal. is it normal to need weeks to recover from an attack..? Im drinking a gallon of water a day and light exercise… i just dont understand. any advice is welcomed thank you 🩷", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767930929.0, "id": "1q7xwkn", "author": "Puzzleheaded-Owl7203", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q7xwkn/need_advise_sos_lol/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "Unexplainable Physical Symptoms", "text": "To preface, I am 20M. I’ve always had some form of anxiety or depression in the past, that I’m sure of, and have always seemed to have pretty persistent headaches that never really went away fully, and my muscles have always seemed tense. But this year, it’s felt like on another level, and it’s genuinely terrifying.\n\nStarting around 7 months ago, I started to feel lightheaded when I was at work, and also came with a really specific sinking feeling, a little bit in my stomach but weirdly mostly in my head. At first I thought it was simply me being dehydrated, but when I drank water and woke up the next morning and it was still there, I knew something was up. Then I started to get other symptoms: first it was brain fog, then the feeling of being off-balance, then I started to feel what I thought was sinus pressure, or at least fairly intense pressure in the middle of my head or nosebridge. After that, I started to have vertigo, or at least a kind where every time I would move my head fast it would disorient me. That’s the best way I can describe it. And then I started to have vision problems, almost like double vision but not, I knew I didn’t have it but it still felt weird. All of that developed within a week or so.\n\nI tried so many things, I got a new prescription on my glasses (didn’t work, still don’t wear them because they make things worse) and I even went to urgent care twice, got told both times that it was likely sinus issues and got prescribed anti inflamitory medication the first time and antibiotics the second, which didn’t work. Saw my PCD, same thing and was prescribed antibiotics. I even got lab work done twice, and my results were fairly normal, nothing justifying the symptoms I had at least. Only thing mildly for concern was my bilirubin. Just doing research would send me into a spiral, though, and make me believe I had every condition listed. Eventually, I learned to live with it and even though it was annoying, it became a new “normal” of sorts, though I wished it would go away every day.\n\nFast forward to now, and my symptoms got better. I didn't feel the off-balance sensation as much and it was mainly the “vertigo”, slight brain fog and a sinking feeling sometimes but recently, around a few days ago, the off-balance sensation came back in full swing, along with another symptom happening multiple times today.\n\nThe only way I can describe it was as a “hum” or vibration in my head (that I can’t hear but feel) and it’s the one of the worst things I’ve felt. It feels like I can hardly think when it comes on and lasts a few seconds, and then lingers for about a minute or so. I’ve heard people describe something similar like brain zaps but I’m not sure it’s that since I’ve never been on any medication or smoked weed or tobacco or anything.\n\nI just want to know if there’s any solution to this issue, I haven’t felt like myself in months and I just want my life back. I’m so scared it could be chronic or life-threatening, but I’ve been told by pretty much everyone I know it’s not that serious. It might not be, but it’s really harming my mental health and overall life enjoyment. It feels so hard to enjoy life right now, and finding a solution or answer is all I really want, or at the very least knowing someone else is out there who’s been here before. I don't even know it's anxiety, but I'm getting anxious just thinking about it.\n\nEdit: Added additional details about labwork.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1767928573.0, "id": "1q7x26i", "author": "Cheaper-Pitch-9498", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q7x26i/unexplainable_physical_symptoms/"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "text": "You mentioned urgent care but you didn’t say anything about talking to a general practitioner to investigate the symptoms. Urgent care/emergency are there to deal with an acute issue and get you back to baseline, not investigate what is not urgent and life threatening. \n\nIf you haven’t been falling or losing consciousness, your blood pressure and heart rate is fine, no fever or low temperature, breathing is fine, pain is manageable, no clear signs of infection, etc etc, they’ll send you home and should be telling you to follow up with a general practitioner. \n\nSure, yes, there are a number of things that could cause your symptoms. It could be as simple as an issue with iron. It also could be psychosomatic due to anxiety (very real physical symptoms that you have when your nervous system is affected by the anxiety). I’m sure you’re finding info online that says “cancer! Epilepsy! Dementia! Chronic mini heart attacks!” But you can’t rule those things out without starving an actual investigation. \n\nTrying to solve it yourself by seeking random acute care or getting yourself new glasses sounds like actions taken in the throes of a particularly anxious attack. You need to bring this to a doctor who can do proper work ups and make proper referrals. And the biggest no-no for anxious and borderline hypochondriac people (me as well) is to go looking on the internet for answers. \n\nFirst and foremost tho go get your doctor to check your labwork, how is your iron and all that good stuff.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "Anxiety", "title": "From hell to light - drug induced panic disorder", "text": "Hello, \n\nI've been getting a lot of messages about how I overcame my panic disorder, so i decided to write a detailed story about my 5 months in hell. I (29M) am from East Europe so some things may be different, than from your culture.\n\n**Intro**\n\nFor 1 year I've been using Speed (Amphetamines) or Cocaine every Friday and Saturday + Alcohol of course. I've never had any problems with anxiety before. One day I tried LSD and we were taking it every weekend (6 weeks). One time I was high on LSD and I had my first ever panic attack. I just stood up from couch and went to toilet and I had started to feel really intense fear. It came out of no where. It lasted 2 hour and I just focused on breathing. I thought I was having a \"bad trip\". After that I took a break from LSD for few months, but I was still doing lines on weekends. Few months after i took LSD again and everything was perfect until one moment where I got panic attack again. I said, well this drug is not for me.\n\nFast forward 2 months, I was on that same couch where I had my first panic attack, we were drinking our second beer and we were doing small lines of Cocaine. I felt tight in my chest so I skipped a line. After half hour I wanted to go home and took one cute, small, baby line and my life changed. I snorted that line and in instant moment i felt rush of some kind of energy  through my body and my ears were beeping - i think its called tinnitus on English.  \nMy heart started to pump so hard, I thought I was having heart attack. I was also having intense derealization. I was paralyzed from fear. I was feeling like I will die. It lasted for 3 hours. It was nightmare. My friend drive me home and I decided to take a break from drugs and i feel asleep.\n\nI woke up and felt dizzy and like I was in carton, like I was in some game... It's hard to explain the feeling. The whole day felt so weird. I had huge pressure in my left boobs and I was 100% sure I have some heart problems because of drugs. I was talking with a customer and suddenly I felt like i was in fast elevator while standing still, that cause me anxiety and I had panic attack. Again I was dying for 20 minutes. I left my work and I somehow drive myself to doctor and I was sitting in waiting room. While I was there i felt perfectly normal, nothing was bothering me. I went inside and talked with my doctor and told her everything and what drugs i took and she told me: \"I think you are having panic attacks\". I was like huuh? What are those? I don't think so! Something is wrong with my heart. She gave me Xannax 0.5mg (Aprazolam). She said I have to send you to mental hospital and drink Xannax sometimes if your having panic, if it helps, it's your anxiety. You are healthy. I tried Xannax next time I was having panic attack and it helped me a lot. I did some research on Xannax and I said, oh boy, im not going to drink those too much, they are so addictive!\n\n**Here the hell begins.** After few days since my visit to the doctor, I woke up with huge pressure on my chest. I felt like someone was standing on my chest (left boob). I felt  derealization (everything was cartoony), dizzines, headaches, insomnia, tinnitus, random stabbing pain, I felt like someone put rubber bands around my head above my eyebrows and my brain was numb. My throat was small, i could barley breath. I was so scared, I didn't know what was happening. Panic attacks every day. But, when I drink Xannax, everything is gone. I didn't want to drink those. Literally from the time I opened my eyes until I went to sleep I had these side effects. I didn't know what was happening.\n\n  \nI was so afraid and alone. I wanted to kill myself. I thought I got stuck in LSD trip and that my life will be until the end like this. I couldn't sleep for 2 days sometimes how scared I was. When I wanted to sleep I would have brain zapps. I would get scared (from the sound) when someone closed the car doors in front of house. It was pure hell. I couldn't work, I couldn't hang out with my friends. I would cry and cry so much because I was so afraid and I wanted to feel normal. At that time, this sounds stupid, but I noticed when i do masturbation i feel perfectly normal and then when I am done, I am back to hell. I said okay Ill go to mental hospital.\n\n(keep in mind this is East Eu) I went to mental hospital and doctor laughed at my in a way oh here is another junkie. He gave me some SSRI and I said I will not drink that. he said: Oh you can do drugs, but your afraid to take SSRI?. I said okay ill give it a chance. I took one pill of Paxil and I had the worst panic attack ever. He told me that its normal, it takes 2-3 weeks for SSRI to start working.  I threw those in garbage. He didn't explain me my situation, he just wanted me to drink pills that will \"fix\" my problem.\n\nAgain I was in hell, all those side effects from moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep my anxiety is over the roof. on lucky days it would have very high anxiety, but on bad days extreme anxiety. Helpless, depressed, tired I again was thinking about killing myself. I felt like I was being tortured alive. I felt like this was the end, I can't live like this anymore.\n\nAfter one and half months I was feeling a little better, I wasn't having panic attacks every day anymore, but the rest of symptoms were still extreme. I also wasn't having head aches anymore. But new everyday whole day symptom showed up. It was dizziness and half of my vision was blurry. My dizziness so was extreme, I felt like I was walking on a boat whole time. I was scared to walk because I felt like I was about to lose balance or consciousness.\n\n  \n**The healing begins.** I was desperate to feel better. I tried a lot of supliments like Ashwaganda, Magnesium Glycinat and so on and nothing helped.  I tried to get drunk and it worked, i felt better, but next 2 days my anxiety was extreme - not worth it!  \nI was reading about CBT and i decided to try it. I only seen her 3 times because it's expensive here. When I started to talk with that lady, it was the first time in 2 months that somebody understands me. I was so happy, somebody finally understood me!   \nshe thought me 2 things:  \n\n\n1. Anxiety is normal emotion. Your anxiety is really high and manifests itself physically.\n\n2. Challenge your fears. Example: Go to work today without Xannax pill in my wallet (I drink it maybe like once or twice a week when I was having panic attack or I could feel it coming)\n\n  \nI just accepted my anxiety and I ignored it. It was so hard, don't think that I did this in one week, It took me at least 1 month to master it. \n\nI remember walking and I was so dizzy and I just said to myself: Well, I don't care anymore If I fall. If I die, I will be at better place because this is hell!\" I was just practicing that mindset and I gave myself a lot of challenges. The hardest one was going out with my friends clubbing. Keep in mind I still feel all those symptoms i mentioned above. I said to myself while having panic attack in club: \"I don't care if i die, at least I won't die home alone, ill die here with my friends\".  \nI noticed when I changed my mindset i started to get better and better. I didn't see improvment in 2 days, it took at least one month to see it so don't be impatient!   \nThe summer came and I went to help my dad lawn the mow at our summer house. I was so focused on it that i forgot about my anxiety. I was in shock. I noticed when I am away from WIFI and flat screens and phones, my anxiety is reducing. I couldn't believe it. I started to go to solo walk in forest and focus on my breathing, i reduced my time on TV/Phone/Computer and I could feel my body healing on weekly bases! I also added some cardio and swimming and I was just spending my free time outside of house. That's it, after 5 months, my anxiety went from extreme to very low. Just changing my mindset saved me.\n\n  \nI have few words for my Anxiety community;  \nI know what you are going through. I know in what hell are you. I promise you It is not forever. I promise you that you will get better. I promise you you will not die.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767914557.0, "id": "1q7rlzz", "author": "Own_Foundation_497", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1q7rlzz/from_hell_to_light_drug_induced_panic_disorder/"}

Him moving out was super tough on me, I was crying like everyday non stop and was terrified for how lonely I would be without him. I eventually went back to college late august which helped distract and ease the transition for me, however it’s still been pretty quiet at the house with just my sister and my mom. My mom unfortunately suffered a stroke so there’s some things that she needs help with (like walking the dogs) which I don’t mind to do but with my siblings home the tasks were more spread out and manageable (everything felt easier and less serious).\n\n\nBack to now: I’m on winter break and i’m heading to London to study abroad but honestly I’m not super excited to go. While i’m gone my childhood house will be put on the market and most likely sold, and my sister plans on moving out in July potentially taking the dogs with her (i still have one more year of college so she would have to take them so she could walk them). I’m struggling so badly coping with this. I don’t see my sister much now but I know that once she moves out i’m probably not going to see her at all besides thanksgiving. Even though she won’t be more than a 30 minute drive from me when she moves out (due to her job location) i know i still won’t see her often. I feel i really attached to my family especially not having many friends in my hometown compared to my college town. I’m devastated about selling my house, my dad passed and it holds a lot of memories for me. I’m also terrified about where i’m gonna end up and what this new house holds for me and my mom. I know things can’t stay the same forever, and I know even if they magically did I would probably hate it, I can’t help but feel so much anxiety, grief, and sadness about it. I’m supposed to feel excited going to study abroad but all I feel is dread for the future. I’m coming back to a new house (potentially i don’t even know if me and my mom have to live in an apartment for a while), my sister moving out shortly after and taking my dogs with her, and soon in a year i’ll be graduating college with no idea on what I want to do with my life. I cannot stop spiralling for the life of me. All i keep thinking about is the future and stressing out over what’s going to happen.

In mid August my doses were 1mg clonazepam per day, and 1.5-2.0mg alprazolam every 2-3 days for emergency use against panic attacks. These are the amounts I've taken for well over ten years.\n\nIn mid October (after going completely without for a while because of having to change doctors) clonazepam was completely eliminated and alprazolam was reduced to ten 0.5mg tablets a month. (Two months later she reduces that to 8 tablets a month but I'll get back to that.) I was given propranolol to replace what was taken, and I'm in agony every day. Does this sound like a sensible taper? Should this be reduced that fast? Oh, and if I my panic attacks get severe I'm supposed to hold an ice cube in one hand while I'm sniffing lavender oil out of a Kleenex in the other hand. And no, I'm not joking.\n\nBefore I forget, I was previously taking hydroxyzine for my nose (though I preferred Benadryl) and I'm allowed to use that for panic, not that it does anything.\n\nI may have a clue, though, and I hope to God that it is actually a clue because it just might save my butt. In preparing to make a complaint to the patient advocacy office of her medical group I was checking over appointment notes. In the meeting notes from out first appointment, she wrote that I had previously been taking 0.5 (¼ of a 2mg tab) every 2-3 days. This is 100% incorrect. Also, last month she reduced me from 10 0.5mg tablets a month to 8, and I'm thinking like, uh she already took most of my medication away from me why would she care about two tablets. If she wrote this down wrong, imthat might explain why she would reduce by 1mg for a month (not per day, per month).\n\nThis IS one of those \"I will never prescribe Xanax to anyone\" type of doctors who treats Xanax as something worse than the panic disorder it fights, and wants it completely eliminated off the face of the earth. She was nice (heh) enough to give me a small fraction of my Xanax to help me taper off.

Went on for days, I checked constantly cause I felt a pulse in my sternum and flutters. Tuesday, for like the third time, I started feeling shaky randomly. Thought it was because I fasted too long (15-18 h sometimes, my meals have been kinda eh lately), so I had food, did not really get better. Next day, I went to the ER, they did a finger prick test 2h after my last meal, came back as 124 and I got sent home, no hypoglycemia. But my shakiness persists.\n\nI had very stressful two months recently, filled with ER visits, panic attacks (had like 4-5 in a span of 8 days this month alone) and lots of hypochondria. Usually, when a symptom appears or sensation, I get scared and focus on it, till it goes away, but that just makes it worse unfortunately. I had shakes during panic attacks but they were extreme jittery full body tremors. This is more subtle. Like shaking when I move my arms and hands, shaking when I get up, walk, stand. Tried to work out, my legs started shaking after the first leg raise. I even have muscle twitches everywhere, although I notice hotspots, like my hip, arms or back. It is like when you hold a sit up for too long, this is how my shakiness feels like, not really visible from the outside, if no, minimally, like internal to slight external trembling. Muscle fatigue sort of.\n\nI have been vegan for 4 months now, I am not sure, if that correlates. I do take supplements occasionally, but not strict rigorous. Found out the supplement I been taking only has 56mg Magnesium, so I started hydrating more (2,5-3l daily) and having electrolyte sachets which add 150 g of Magnesium. The fizzy tablets I used to drink had 250 mg but apparently the absorption is bad and anxiety insanely depletes your magnesium. I do not go outside much, I am too scared of a panic attack in public. I sleep from 4-5 am till 10-1pm usually, my schedule matches my LDR.\n\nI have a check up with my doctor soon, but I am so tired of coming over and seeing him for stuff like that because at this point, I am not sure, am I sick? Or is it anxiety again? I tried Zoloft but after one pill my anxiety spiked like crazy to the point I ended up in the ER with pains again, got prescribed [promethazine.

It was initially painful but is now only slightly palpable, flat, smooth, and movable. A few weeks ago, I had a swollen lymph node on the other side of my groin, which had a normal morphology and disappeared after about two weeks.

I'm sorry if this may come off as silly, i dont even know if I could assign a name to this phobia, but everytime I'm in an exam hall, I'm doing absolutely fine if the ac is on/ light ambience going on in the background. it's almost comforting to me. but as soon as the ac is switched off, the classroom goes dead drop silent, so silent u could possibly hear ur own heartbeat and the person next to u breathing. I start panicking internally like crazy even tho I may seem fine on the outside. yes I do ask the teacher to switch on the ac but some prick in the back feels cold 24/7 and most of the time the ac is busted and it's also winter at the moment. adrenaline rushes up and I feel my heartbeat increase, breathing gets harder and tears start to well up in my eyes. my brain and body instantly go into fight or flight mode for no reason at all, and as a response to adrenaline my stomach starts roaring like crazy; stomach rumbling noises and random bodily noises get triggered. their so loud and it gets me so embarrassed and scared that I need to flee from the situation. \n\nHad a test of 3 hours today and ran to the washroom and broke into tears and had a small panic attack. On the other hand, when the room is occupied with the noises of ac, chatter, or anything at all I feel completely alright and my stomach is no longer rumbling anymore.\n\nalways wondering of what the person sitting next to me thinks, \"ew wtf are those noises..?\" \nI dont know why such a problem even arose in the first place or what triggered it. it started off in school and now I suffer from it even outside school.\n\nI was always a good student but now my grades keep falling down because of a stupid phobia. I freeze midway my test and start to genuinely freak out. I always tend to avoid silence. I feel like I would genuinely pass out from it. In the beginning it was tolerable but now I just keep crying everyday and lose my appetite easily. I'm crying as I type this. I genuinely don't know what to do, I've told many people about this but no one takes me seriously. and its makes me mad that why am I the only one who's panicking this way and no one else? why are everybody else calm? do they not suffer from anything similar?\n\nI've told my parents about this but it was a long time ago. they're always there for me no matter what. I feel like a disappointment to them cuz my academic performance keeps falling down and they keep having hopes. \n\nand yes I've tried everything to get rid of stomach growls, eat more breakfast than I usually do, breathing exercises, self-reassurance that it's just you and ur paper and no one else cares. but nothing seems to work and my brain is being way too stubborn. at this point I would like for someone to knock me out in the head so I wake up not remembering some things and specially not this.\n\nfor ppl who suffer from this or something similar, what do u do? Im so tired that I wanna approach a therapist or a psychiatrist for pills because logical reasoning isnt working anymore.\n\nand please do not say things like just clutch ur stomach in or hold ur breath I'm sorry I've already done that and it makes my situation even worse. \n\nThank u all for reading.
