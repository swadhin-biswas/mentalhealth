Also I smoke weed everyday lol I got diagnosed with a weed dependency but it keeps me sane😭love my plant. Thing is today is the only day I was fully sober, and now I'm having this little episode. That's what prompted this rant. Just me not smoking enough weed today. This is what hides underneath my addiction. The smoking is Probablyy not the best for me longterm... I am even growing two in my closet so fucking illegally and they're my babies oh how I love themm anyways, my mom actually bought me a lot of dbt books for Christmas and you've reminded me I need to get on with reading those instead of texting people I want to kill them! \n\nAlso I've got a psychiatrist, just feel like I'm hitting a wall with her. She prescribes me meds and does the basics but I feel like there could be better ones out there honestly. I suspect I have BPD and my therapist agreed I probably do but didn't want to diagnose me. So here I am just waiting. I don't have therapy right now we because I'm not 18 yet so I have to wait for my mom to find a therapist for me and she's having a hard time with it. She calls some places but no answer or they don't take our insurance. I get overwhelmed by the idea of searching for a therapist to call myself but I guess I could if I tried, I just don't make the financial statements cuz I can't drive, my parents are holding me back.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "text": "Upon reading all the other responses, I see most people sharing the belief that someone (whether it be their mom, their family generally, or their pets) would be utterly devastated if they were to pass, and that is their reason for not doing so\n\nAnd yes, this is true. I don't have any reason to believe your close ones wouldn't be devastated by your death. But then again, what would be the case if, say, you didn't have anyone who would miss you? What then? As upsetting as that sounds, I feel its a legitimate concern\n\nHere's how I think about suicide: suicide, as well as any degree or form of self-harm, is something which is fundamentally illogical. I find that most of my suicidal ideation hits me completely uncontextually, almost inappropriately. Moreover, it doesn't go anywhere—very rarely (at least as I've felt/seen in others) do people legitimately work out the kinks and logistics of how their suicide will be conducted\n\nSo, I think of self-harm as a whole to be a sort of immediate, instinctual reaction to the throes we face in our life. It's always when I'm face-to-face with something so seemingly-insurmountable that it immediately comes to me: \"I wish I was dead\". In theory, it's very promising: we would be rid of responsibility, of guilt, of mistakes, etc.—of course, at the price of everything else we actually care for\n\nBut if we leave these suicidal thoughts undeveloped, unelaborated upon, we end up never reaching the absurd conclusion for which it leads to. And suicide is absurd! No other animal desires its own death, and realistically, neither do we necessarily\n\nBut self-harm, as well as suicidal ideation, allows us to, just for a moment, have a sense of control over our lives. By either actually doing something harmful to ourselves, or even just imagining it, and all the people who would care, we can reclaim a sense of lost mastery\n\nSo I suggest for you to have an open monologue with yourself. Reflect on the sources of your dismay and elaborate on them, to yourself. Consider when, where, and why you begin thinking suicidally\n\nThough suicide feels like a triumph, like surmounting an impossible pole-vault, but of course the other side of that vault is a canyon\n\nAnd moreover, I think it would do you good to look beyond the belief that \"it will get better with everyday that passes\". The passage of days alone doesn't constitute development, and you know this, but rather what you can accomplish; what you can learn and come to understand in that time. So be active! Even if that just means talking with yourself and others\n\nI wish the best for you", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768038576.0, "id": "nyrg0bz", "author": "Few_Alarm3323"}
{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "text": "I thought removing me would end the problems. I wasn't particularly causing problems for others but I know I annoyed both my parents with my inability to cooperate with society. I hated myself wondering why i couldnt just be like everyone else, normal. Turns out I have autism and adhd so my brain is fighting me and fixing me all the time, never ending cycle.\n\nSo the first thing that stopped me, at 14 I tied a piece of rope to a wooden upright in the loft and lowered myself into a noose. The piece of wood snapped as soon as it pulled tight but I felt a fear that I'd never felt before and that was enough to hold me off a few years.\n\nSecond time, pre diagnosis of AuAdhd. And totally bizarre. My partner of the time compounded my negative thoughts by vocalising everything that was wrong with me, despite my best efforts to fit in i couldnt hold down a job, couldnt pay bills on time, forget birthdays, anniversaries etc and lose everything, poor concentration and memory. I walked to the top of a hill on Christmas day, expecting it to be empty and leave a few days after for news to spread that I'd died, my partner of the time said \"take your dog with you\" when I said I needed to go for a walk to clear my head. I took an unhealthy amount of oral morphine with me, my plan was to drink the bottle on the way up, watch the sunset and morphine myself into a coma where I'd stop breathing or die of hypothermia. I'd drank half the bottle by the time I got to the top, safe to say I was spaced out. Took the collar and leash off my dog and set her free, thinking she would find her way home. I know she was frustrated all the way up being on a leash but as soon as I took the leash off she laid next to me and we watched the sun set together. I was starting to drift away and 2 ravens showed up, I guess they were assuming we were carrion that they could eat but my dog got up and chased them. The ravens kept flying off, circling low but not attacking, going from one perch to another but heading downhill, back in the direction of home. Don't know what made me get up and follow but i stumbled all the way down and found the ravens were perched on my car, my dog was sat with them and all 3 watched me until i got back to my car, as soon as I opened the door, dog jumped in and curled up in a ball. ravens flew off and I sat in the drivers seat and slept a solid 16 hours. Was it real or a hallucination I don't know. Felt very real, either was something guided me back. When I woke up I felt rougher than a 3 day bender hangover but made it home. Only ever told a therapist that.\n\n Few years later but when my dog died it broke something inside of me, I felt loss second hand and realised that's what I would do to everyone else that knew me. So that pain is my reminder not to inflict that on someone else. Whether they love you or loathe you, you not being there at all takes away the chance of reconciliation. It's expensive as hell but an investment in yourself and your future, even if you feel like you don't want one now...book a couple of sessions with a therapist and tell the whole honest truth from day one. You might find the first few can't help but if you persist you'll find someone suited to your mental needs. They can't cure you but they can help make connections and offer an impartial view on what Is cycling through your mind\n\nSorry, I've rambled on more than I expected but if you've made it this far, your death isn't the answer. Life is an ocean and you're swimming to the shore, there'll be crests and lows. To quote dory, just keep swimming\n\nEdit to add, I'm 37. I've been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts/attempts since I was 12. Nothing can stop the dark thoughts other than yourself, the consequences of your death outweigh the benefits, you arent ending the darkness in your mind you are spreading it and infliciting it upon others. There might be a defining moment for you, like the loss of someone or the failed attempts that let you know suicide isn't the right choice, or there might not. I've found the most important thing is if you are depressed, allow yourself to be that. Bed rot for 3 days. Turn off your phone. But when the negative self talk becomes too loud you need to find a way inside yourself to silence it, or argue with it until you win.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768038951.0, "id": "nyrgorb", "author": "bozwold"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "text": "I was gonna but then someone I cared bout died, and I saw what it did to the people around me. Being suicidal does this really fucking annoying thing where this pretentious voice tells you that everyone would be better off without you, and yeah they’d be sad for a bit but I’m the end you’re doing what’s best. And I do mean pretentious, because this voice is CONVINCED that nobody else understands, and if they say they do then they *think* they do but they don’t, and also the voice knows what’s best for everyone. It doesn’t feel pretentious while it’s happening but looking back it’s actually infuriatingly annoying to deal with for both you and the people who want you alive. \n\nAnyways the voice is like “trust they’ll be fine. They’ll be sad for a bit but then they’ll thrive” and then my aunt was killed.\n\nSome background on my aunt, she was a single mother of 3. All 3 kids had different dads. People would come into her life and she was a yeller but she did take care of them. She would baby terrible people for a chance to be loved and they would leave her pregnant and never look back. Her life was so fucking stressful, and admittedly a fair amount of it was her fault, she struggled with drugs and alcohol, had trouble making friends with good people, and invited danger in her life convinced she could fix it. She did however, always keep her kids fed , clothed , and housed. She worked 3 jobs and did her absolute best. She was born poor to two of the worst parents on the planet, and she died doing her best but not quite enough to break the cycle. By all means one would think “she’s at rest now, and her family will be able to move on and thrive “\n\nWrong. All 3 of her kids were separated. The youngest went with her dad who had to get sober quick but did manage to pull it together. The middle child went to live with his dad who tanked him. He would tell his kid that his mother was a slut bitch anyways and it’s good she’s gone, he got him hooked on all kinds of shit and would sabotage any efforts to get a job or education so he could have someone else convinced that “the world just isn’t good to people like him.” The oldest was homeless for a long time, but eventually made his way to Oregon where he got a girl pregnant. She went to jail but when she got out they got married and he lives in her mama’s trailer with her.\n\nMy uncle was never the same. His sister was another half of him. He was already an alcoholic, but now he’s incomprehensible. He told me he stays away from me because he’s a fuck up , and I’m doing so well he’s scared his fuck up will spread to me. I miss him a lot, but I know it won’t be the same. \n\nMy mama lost everything with them. My mom was raised by the same garbage dad my aunt was, but she cleaned up and fought her way out of poverty in the 90’s. Her whole life all she wanted was a relationship with her siblings but she kept getting passed from house to house. Only in her adult life did she finally get to have that sibling relationship with them, just for her sister to die and her brother to retreat. No amount of money or success or really anything can make up for the loss of family my mother feels. Those siblings are the only ones who understand the hell they were raised in , and it’s isolating not to have that ever again. \n\n\nThe voice in your head , the pretentious one, swears up and down that your absence will eventually not be noticed , you are a weight or danger and the sooner you leave the better, but I have seen what it looks like when someone who *actually* could be considered dangerous due to the company they kept passes away, and it doesn’t solve half the shit that little voice thinks it does.

Now you can mention them and stay present. What you share changes too - you used to only describe events, but now you're talking about how you felt, what you're noticing about yourself, what you want to try differently.\n\nYou're doing things you avoided. You went to that family thing. You took a different route. You said no when you wanted to. These feel tiny but they're not - avoidance getting smaller means you're expanding what you can handle. You're catching yourself. You snapped at someone, then actually went back and apologized. That pause between getting triggered and reacting? That's new.\n\n# \n\n**BUT! The self doubt!!**\n\nTrauma teaches you not to trust yourself. So even when you ARE making progress, your brain finds reasons to doubt it. \"Maybe I'm just having a good week.\" \"Maybe this isn't real, maybe I'm feeling better randomly.\" That doubt often comes from the same place as the original trauma. If you learned early that you can't trust yourself, your brain will apply that lens to everything - including your healing.\n\n  \n\n\n**Here's stuff to know if things are working:**\n\nYou're still showing up, even when it's hard or feels pointless. You're being honest in sessions about when something feels off. You're noticing small things - that you got triggered, that you went numb, patterns you're seeing. Noticing always comes before changing.\n\n**Healing doesn't feel like you think it should. You expect some big breakthrough moment. What actually happens is quieter** \\- you realize you didn't check the locks obsessively last night, you had a difficult conversation and stayed present, you felt angry without spiraling into shame about it.\n\nIf you're in trauma therapy and wondering if it's actually doing anything: Are you still going? Are you being real about what's happening? Are you noticing anything - even tiny things - that feel different? If yes, it's working. Your brain is just really good at convincing you it's not.\n\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768029762.0, "id": "1q8xsji", "author": "drantoniodcosta", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8xsji/the_weird_thing_about_trauma_therapy_you_dont/"}

But honestly you just kinda gotta try to focus on being healthy overall and not weight itself.

Try to focus on healthy foods in healthy amounts, ideally stuff you like the taste of, or at least enjoy to make. And you don't gotta do \"working out\" as your exercise either. If there's any sorta sport or other physical things you like doing, you can do those. I've gotten into hunting and tracking recently, which essentially is just off-trail hiking, it's really been helping me out with exercise while still having a lot of fun doing something I enjoy. \n\nBeing at college can actually help out with achieving both a good diet, exercise, and mentality. Whatever the student health and support resources sorta department your school has, give them a call and see if they have dietitians and/or mental health counseling. Usually the school will provide stuff like that for free for students. Your school likely also has a good several clubs, events, and sport teams you can look into partaking in for some fun or guided exercise. Schools don't always have the Best when it comes to support resources and mental health professionals and all, but hey it's free and you don't gotta travel anywhere and sometimes you get lucky with a super awesome counselor or something. And if you have some good friends, absolutely ask them to do some fun stuff with you that contributes to your goal, like going to the beach to swim or just playing some Frisbee or something out on the green. Company and encouragement from someone you trust can be really reassuring. My point is, you don't gotta deal with things on your own. Whether it's mental struggle, or physically taking steps to be healthier, ask for help where you can. \n\nGood luck and stay safe 🫡🫡", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768023905.0, "id": "nyqo98p", "author": "Gatsby_Soup"}

So I've become so hobby-less and extremely bored at home. \n\n\nI also retain from doing things that require mental effort because I get frustrated and I become too much of a perfectionist and overthink everything, for example: I used to be really good at drawing and it was one of my hobbies that I really enjoyed.

My best friend is my FP, and honestly, I feel like my life revolves around her. When something happens with her, even small things, I crash completely. My emotions go nuclear and I can’t stop obsessing.\n\nFor example, today they were on a call with someone else just a two-hour call. Logically, I know it’s fine. They’re allowed to talk to people. But emotionally? I felt like the world was ending. I got jealous, panicky, and my brain kept spinning. That's OUR thing like we call till late in the night.I think stuff like : “Why aren’t they talking to me? Am I not enough? What if they like them more than me?” My chest tightened, my stomach sank, and I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I had a complete melt down\n\nOr when something goes slightly wrong between us, I misread a message, they don’t respond immediately, I spiral. I get this deep, sinking feeling that my whole world is collapsing, like everything that matters is slipping away.\n\nI am always checking if she's online, her reposts like a crazy person. I can't express how insane this feels. I plan my whole life around her. I logically know i'm being unreasonable but I physically can't stop. I get so jealous when she's talking to other people especially her other good friend. I see her as competition. I hate the idea that they're talking because wtfdym you talk to others when i'm here? \n\nAm i in the wrong for feeling this way? I barely eve tell her about my struggles so..\n\nEven when we’re fine, I’m exhausted. My mind constantly loops through scenarios: “Did I do something wrong? Did they like what I said? Are they going to leave me?” I know it sounds extreme, but I can’t help it.\n\nI’ve tried framing this as attachment issues, anxiety, panic disorder, or depression in the past but when i got diagnosed with bpd everything finally clicked.\n\nI just want advice on coping. How do people manage when an FP dominates their entire emotional life? How do you stop yourself from crashing, obsessing, or feeling like everything is falling apart whenever something happens with them? I feel trapped in my own head, and I don’t know how to handle it anymore. Nothing has helped me exept constant reassurance from her.\n\nThanks for reading.

When I hit high school, I faced friendship drama typical for teenagers, but at the time, I was attending a rigorous and competitive boarding school during Covid so we were not allowed to leave the school’s campus the entire semester. The friendship drama felt like my whole world and my anxiety increased tenfold. I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t sleep and the following summer, I experienced a massive period of depression where I couldn’t home.  \n  \nThe following school year, my senior year, my friends apologized for how they had acted towards me and we graduated on a good note, but since then, my mental health has taken a huge blow.  \n  \nI struggle with severe social anxiety and the idea of being rejected by people (friends, family, classmates and coworkers) drives me into major panic attacks. I spiral and make up scenarios in my head that all my friends hate me and actually don’t want me around even if they have never give me an indication of that. Before high school, I never used to place so much weight on the opinions of other people, but now it’s almost the value system I use to determine my own self-esteem. I genuinely can’t be around myself if I think someone is upset with me but it’s like a never-ending loop because I’m constantly convincing myself that everyone hates me. I genuinely feel so out of beat with everyone else and it’s so painful to feel so different. It’s like I don’t know how to properly socialize with others.  \n  \nSince high school, I have seen three different counselors (graduate students from psychology departments at universities), been placed on various Lexapro prescriptions and am currently being assessed for ADHD to understand my restlessness and inability to sit still.  \n  \nI’m now in my final semester in my senior year of college and I don’t know what to do.

He's a veteran who is innellidgable for VA assistance and our line of work doesn't provide healthcare and neither one of us can afford it independently.\n\nThings have been extra rough for us socially and financially this last year and he's been on a pretty steep decline mentally from all of it and has been turning to a lot more self destructive/self harm type behaviors. I've been doing my best to address these behaviors and support him through all of it but i feel like i'm not helping at all. \n\nToday was a big turning point I feel for him.

I love my boyfriend he’s done so much for me and without him I wouldn’t have stopping SH but when I told him how I wanted to give up cause all I do is fuck up he just said ok and now I’m wondering am I being to much for him to handle.\n\nAm I just as awful as I say I am and by pushing my problems onto him am I making his life worse. How can I stop the stress and pain and how do o stop the tears and shakiness every time I think about how broke I am and what all I need done. Why am I not perfect enough for my mom and sister, why am I so stupid I can’t figure out some paperwork. I just wanna make the internal pain stop and I wanna SH so bad but I know I can’t but I need it. I need it to make the voices stop.\n\nIdk if anyone will ever read or respond to it but I need something or anyone to make me realize how stupid I am for feeling this way and that I’m over reacting. I need clarity cause I’m going fucking crazy and I need a person who doesn’t know me to look at it from another angle and help me….please….i don’t wanna relapse please….", "score": 1, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768014777.0, "id": "1q8t0co", "author": "snow_baby_2025", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8t0co/i_wanna_relapse_and_im_scared/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "title": "Only Going To Share What I Want/Feel Comfortable Sharing About My Life", "text": "I like to share some things that go on in my life because it’s one of the things that help me cope with my severe mental health problems, but then I worry about others making false assumptions about my life based on what I share. I mean, I feel a strong temptation that I have to share everything about my life, but I’m training myself to just share what I want to share and not share what I don’t want to and accept whatever false assumptions others think about based on what I share and don’t share instead of sharing nothing because that’ll lead me to even more avoidance and self-isolation. For example, I like sharing how I’m currently doing in online college, if I had a successful holiday celebration with my family, or whatever I want and know is safe to share. Things I don’t want to share are- I’m not sharing what I don’t want to share about my life. I like to keep a secret personality like all the big social media influencers that have secret personalities off their account. I decided that I’m only going to share what I want to share and not mention even the tiniest of what I don’t want to share to avoid accidentally giving hints on what I want to keep secret. That’s how everyone does sharing their life, so I should do the same. Choosing to quit sharing everything over this mindset is just avoidance and will result in me avoiding and self-isolating even more. It’s all about balance. I share what I want to share and avoid mentioning what I want to remain secret, while accepting others making false assumptions about what I do and don’t do in life based on what I share because that’s how everyone does it. If someone asks me about something that I don’t want to share, I’ll respond with something like “maybe, maybe not”, or lie, because nobody needs to know everything about my life, just like most people would never hint at or lie about what they don’t feel comfortable sharing or telling the truth about. I know that sometimes lying about my life will cause some of my truth to be falsely assumed as lies, but I shouldn’t care anymore. Others can choose whenever they want to believe my response to their questions about what I’m currently doing in life. Now I’m not saying I’m going to start telling others lies about my life if you’re wondering that. I’ll mainly only lie if I’m asked something I don’t want or feel comfortable being truthful about. That’s how everyone does it, mainly to protect themselves from uncomfortableness. It’s better to not answer or lie about what I don’t want or feel comfortable sharing than to increase my avoidance and self-isolation behavior. Even though lying or responding “maybe, maybe not” will make me feel uncomfortable for not answering truthfully, sharing what I want to keep secret about my life will do worse damage, like having me avoid doing things I don’t want to share or haven’t shared yet.  Another thing I want to say is if I want to share something about my life, I’ll think about if it’s something that’ll backfire. For example, let’s say I entered a lottery and won a huge amount of money. It feels like something I want to share, but it’ll backfire if I do. (I can privately share that with trusted people though) In conclusion, I should be able to do whatever I’m able to do without having to share it. They can assume whatever they want about what I'm doing and not doing in my current life.\n\nThis post is an update to my last, by the way: https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/s/u7rjd5xraq", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768011685.0, "id": "1q8rvvd", "author": "FestiveGiftOfFun", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8rvvd/only_going_to_share_what_i_wantfeel_comfortable/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "title": "Choosing peace of a career when you have BPD", "text": "I’m a 27-year-old woman recently diagnosed with BPD (about a year ago), after a lifetime of being misdiagnosed and medicated only for anxiety despite multiple ER visits for severe mental health crises. The diagnosis was devastating but also a relief — for the first time, things made sense and I started receiving proper treatment. My major breakdown happened during my first job as a graphic designer. I have a master’s degree and genuinely love the field, but the work environment was extremely toxic: constant pressure, unpaid overtime, emotional manipulation, lack of boundaries, and a boss who believed the company should come before health or personal life. I had panic attacks almost every night, daily headaches, extreme exhaustion, and I often lashed out at my husband due to bottled-up frustration. The only days I felt less anxious were when my boss wasn’t in the office. I eventually suffered a severe burnout, went on medical leave, returned barely able to function, and when my schedule was extended even further, I realized I couldn’t physically or mentally handle it anymore. I quit the next day. I’ve been unemployed for about a year and a half now. I consistently apply for jobs but get almost no responses. I tried freelancing and had multiple bad experiences with clients who delayed payment or disappeared entirely. I’ve since started studying for a Scrum certification (I also have a bachelor’s degree in IT), but I have no real-world experience yet. What scares me is that many job postings use the same “hustle culture” language my former boss did (“high pressure,” “constant change,” “company comes first”). At the same time, something important happened: since I stopped working, my mental health has improved dramatically. My husband says he has never seen me this emotionally stable, present, or happy in our 7-year relationship — and I feel the same. Our relationship has improved significantly. I have the privilege of having a husband who can financially support us, which gives me stability. I genuinely enjoy being at home, taking care of the house, and living without daily anxiety. I feel deep guilt and shame because being a homemaker is often looked down on, especially for young women, but if it weren’t for social judgment, I would choose this life without hesitation. I’m afraid that going back to work would destroy the stability I’ve finally achieved. At the same time, I feel ashamed for wanting a slower, quieter life.

OCD, depression, anxiety, panic attacks, phobias, BPD, etc. It's been really tough for me to maintain stability for as long as I can remember. \n\nBUT! Lately, I've been improving. I had a wake up call about how identified I had become with my struggles and how it perpetuated a need to think about them, have them validated by others, and thus gave them immense power over my life. \n\nFor depression specifically, it was a toxic cycle of wanting to improve -&gt; relapsing into bad habits -&gt; feeling so much shame and guilt that I stayed low -&gt; finally crawling back out of a slump. I decided that I needed to break the cycle somewhere. I couldn't prevent relapsing into bad habits, but I could prevent how long I wallowed in the shame of failure. So I've recently tried this thing about letting myself fall. I let myself have a day, be sad, be lazy, etc. But I will get back up tomorrow. And it worked! Over time. \n\nIt's important to celebrate the win of \"this time I got back up within one day!\" instead of wallowing in \"I cant believe I let myself be so lazy today\". \n\nI'm happy to report that now when I have a particularly disruptive emotion, I have more control over how I allow it to guide my decisions. I very rarely even call out over mental health episodes anymore - something I used to reguarly QUIT jobs over!

I’ve been abused by past partners and had no good relationships with family growing up so it’s like a breath of fresh air. He’s patient, kind hearted, fun, loves me for every part of me. Consistency is a big thing for me and he shows up 100% of the time when I need. Has learnt how to handle my emotions when I become upset and spiral with anxiety. We have never had a big argument. \n\nI legally changed my name a few years ago and socially in high school. This was for many reasons but I don’t like to mention it and haven’t told anyone newer in my life about my name. Hearing my old name can trigger me sometimes and I turn back into the little girl neglected by everyone and spiral a lot. It hasn’t happened often since it was legally changed so I don’t think about it much. Go to therapy to work through my triggers. It’s great.\n\nLast night we were having a conversation and I don’t remember how it came up but the idea of a “real name” came up and he suddenly blurted out my old name unprompted and laughed. He genuinely seemed to think it was silly and nothing at all serious. I immediately closed up and said that’s not my name - because it legitimately isn’t even legally anymore. \n\nI had mentioned to him that I changed my last name legally recently and he seemed to not fully believe me. He knew my old last name because I do not hide that, it’s randomly scattered everywhere but not as triggering for me. When we were speaking then I really emphasised the trouble I went to so that I could change it (took a lot of paperwork and money). He said he understood but almost hesitant? Hard to explain. Then after that he suddenly blurts out my old name last night and I realise he’s somehow found out. \n\nI never intended to hide it forever, it’s a part of me and my story, but I felt it maybe wasn’t a good time and since it’s changed now it wasn’t as pressing to mention. I asked how he knew and he said he didn’t know he accidentally found some mail or documents somewhere in my room and that it was okay. \n\nI got upset and told him I had really changed it, pulled out the legal documents to prove it, and shut down. \n\nHe was apologetic and clearly felt bad. He said he just didn’t realise it could be serious and it genuinely never occurred to him that it could be a sensitive topic in a bad way for me. \n\nI suppose I am upset not just that he used my name, but after telling him multiple times my name (last name) changed he just didn’t believe me? And he clearly didn’t because he saw old paperwork sometime recently but also any mail from years ago would clearly be from years ago and not recently delivered. He could have like clarified with me more about when I changed it etc as well even without mentioning my first name. It hurts to hear the name used so casually but equally hurts to not be believed when it’s such a silly thing to be dishonest about. \n\nI have overthought many times about my name and wondered if I was honest would people view me any differently or think I have deceived them or lied. I know I haven’t, and even if legally it never changed it’s my decision to be called whatever I prefer. \n\nHow do I get over this feeling? I just feel …. empty? Hurt and a little angry. We did kind of talk about it but it didn’t help. I’m scared this feeling will never go away. I feel guilty for being upset with him.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "title": "Feeling very demotivated after a \"feedback\" session", "text": "So I was in vocational school (still am since I'm not officially certified it takes time) and I'm doing animation. \nSo long story short, last year was an absolute nightmare. My dad was SEVERELY sick to the point where we wouldn't even know if he'd survive. God knows how many times I cried myself to sleep thinking I'd wake up to a news i wasn't ready for. On top of that I got into some competition where I was worked to death as one man army for over a month in the school. And in October my grandpa from mom side got worsened condition. October and November was spent in hospital as I'm the only one who can fill in forms in english. And he unfortunately (or fortunately given how bad he'd gotten) passed away. It is still a fresh wound and I had blamd myself for a while because I was there and I didn't do enough. But according to mom and dad , grandpa was already too old and had gotten dementia. Even theyd wished hed pass away peacefully (which he did in sleep).\n\n\nSo last year all in all was just a year I'd never want to experience. Truthfully I've forgotten it. I know the details but no memories of what I was feeling. Maybe it's a way for my brain to defend itself. \n\n\nRegardless, today I went for a feedback after a few days. And I have 2 instructors (A for animation, M for modelling)\n\n\nI went to M without calling first. And he was like \"you should've come after calling or informing me\" and I told him that just last month I tried contacting him 5 different times and he never once answered. But he was like \"but did you call today?\" Like . .. what? Regardless he did nothing. He didn't bother looking at my references and told me he's going for actual human anatomy (the character was humoid) and I kept telling him that I was using a real human to sculpt the model in zbrush and to at least look at the references I was using. He just moved some stuff around and fixed precisely 1 thing. And then when I showed him archviz he accused me of downloading assets. I felt so offended but again didn't say anything.\n\n\nBut I think the issue truly began when I was in room with A (had set up an appointment) and he started talking about superficial concern of how i wasn't good enough despite it been one year since I started doing animation full time. Like at least ask me why I wasn't improving as fast but he labelled me as \"slow\" and was like \"&lt;my name&gt; please tell me if you're seriously hitting a limit because what is this animation you're showing me\" and M entered the room and made it all worse. Instead of feedback, it became character assessment. Nd i received 2 half assed feedback that I'd probably post on reddit later and get some actual feedback.\n\n\nBut I think it did hurt me a lot. \"Slow\"? He labelled me without even asking me why I wasn't improving as fast as my peers? I felt so hurt and given how fresh every other wound is, this is more like a breaking point. \n\n\nI tried my best and i want to be an artist. Whatever mental capacity I had, I put it in art. I didn't make friends, i didn't hang out with anyone, i stopped watching anime and movies. I did what I could with what I had. It wasn't enough. So now I'm thinking should I just give up? I know I'm currently in emotional turmoil and maybe it's best to not reach harsh conclusions. Maybe i should cry and then tomorrow morning go back to animation again. But I just don't know why I'm THIS hurt. Like these instructors were never kind or respectful to begin with but today hurt me.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768006815.0, "id": "1q8q2cn", "author": "forhaniseyo", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8q2cn/feeling_very_demotivated_after_a_feedback_session/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "title": "Are hallucinations worth seeking professional help over, or is this normal?", "text": "\n18M\n\nI’m not really sure how to start this without sounding like I’m insane, but it’s becoming a genuine issue in my life to the point I’m considering whether or not I need to go in and get evaluated for anything. I’m sorry for how ridiculous this sounds.\n\nThroughout my childhood, starting around the age of 8, I began experiencing long-lasting and vivid hallucinations. These ranged from demonic figures in windows, to cameras watching me, to eels swimming around my bedroom.\n\nMy longest hallucination (that I know of) occurred non-stop over a period of roughly 36 hours. I was about 9, and vividly remember being sat at the kitchen counter doing homework while my mother washed dishes. At some point she came up to me with my grandmother on the phone, telling me that my grandmother was going to die and she wanted to say goodbye. I had a full 2-3 minute conversation with my grandmother and went to bed that night crying because I thought she was dead. This belief that she was dead continued for the next 24 hours until the next morning when I asked my mother who was going to take care of her dogs now that she was dead, and my mother told me she was fine, had never called, and nothing like that had happened. I was left incredibly disoriented and confused, but nobody ever actually looked further into this event or others that I had. \n\nWhen I turned about 12 the hallucinations mostly stopped for a good two years with the exception of small things. Around the age of 14 they returned, but I only had ‘big ones’ in two events:\n\n-Someone putting their hand on my shoulder while in the bath\n-Waking up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and seeing my face contorted into a jumble of features when looking in the mirror\n\nAgain, following this they stopped for another two years. At the age of 16 I had two  more events:\n\n-Watching my sister drive off for college only for a white van with LED headlights to come speeding down the street, intentional swerving into the back of her car and killing her. I heard my mother next to me screaming \n-An orange cat being torn open and strewn about my kitchen. I can still hear its insides squishing under my shoes.\n\nAgain they stopped for two years. Well, I’m now 18, and the past two weeks they’ve suddenly been back full force. I’m hallucinating daily, especially during the night, but nothing too long or extreme yet. More frequent smaller things like:\n\n-Faces watching me\n-Figures standing next to me\n-My pets contorted into horrifying creatures\n-Things falling or being thrown \n\nMy longest hallucination was about 36hrs, and the shortest was about 20 seconds. I’ve never had any auditory ones. I don’t know what it is. I’ve never spoken about these to anyone before and I’m embarrassed. More than anything I’m honestly terrified. I constantly feel paranoid, and they scare me badly when they happen even though I know they’re not real. I’ve also started to have more paranoid thoughts like my pets are actually demons that are going to kill me or people are watching me through my windows or my food is poisoned. I can’t sleep at night anymore because I’m scared something that doesn’t exist will happen to me.  My parents don’t believe in mental health or mental conditions so I could never bring this up before, but now that I’m 18 and moving out I’m wondering if I need help. Do I go to the doctor over this?

So in one bedroom with several single beds for me and my siblings  and he, slept there too. \n\nMy family is very \"conservative &amp; known to be highly religious\" so being the youngest , stupid, coward, and naive one i never said it anyone or made a big issue out of it , because i wanted to maintain peace and harmony in the household without causing issues anyone, except me\n\nMAIN STUFF (what i remember)-\nAnd i don't remember when it started but it suddenly happened after him  pampering me up to eventually touching me. So, he started with grooming my butt and also said things like \"you like it don't you, or if you didn't like it you would scream or make me off you\" (not exact words), and as days or weeks passby he became more and more comfortable \"because of my dumb naivety\" he started touching my 'PP' through the trousers and shorts. Then as me staying silent, enduring it and acting normal, he got super comfortable like before he only slightly groped me but now he groped me anytime anywhere he wanted.\n\n And then those nights , which i still relive the memories. It was night as usual i was as always watching youtube videos ( i loved watching pewdiepie, jacksepticeye on my ipad mini) and as usual he started touching,  molesting me (the single beds in the bedroom had approx one leg space in between them) and then he scooted over my bed area so his front and hands touches butt and PP (and i ignored as it was \"usual or normal for me\" at this point) but then i felt something go inside my butt and i first ignored because like i didn't want to assume anything (because i didn't have any concept of sex or anything i hadn't talked to a girl yet, i was the \"quiet good student\"). And then he started to even slap my genital i didn't know why he did that? \nAlso it was a quite common nickname he and other uncles to make fun off my body (particularly legs/hips) or appearance or being too \"female-like\" (i don't know what they meant by it). \n\n(i mean i was like fifteen and was among the taller kids in school and i was constantly reminded that i have big thighs and butt, i mean i was introduced to gym and workouts since age of nine/ten)\n\nEXTRA\nI never wanted to speak about it to anyone especially any of my family members. \nI still relive those memories or sometimes feel it\n (i still am virgin, not been in a relationships for various other reasons which frankly no one needs to know , simply  i don't want to waste other person's valuable time) and I'm scared of being vulnerable again. \n\"PS: I'm in my early 20s currently\"\n", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768001781.0, "id": "1q8o3vy", "author": "Kool-Aid-Kool67", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8o3vy/guilt_and_shame_with_thoughts_of_ending_probably/"}

I would often get silent treatment or hitting as punishments and i think thag has really shaped how I am. My parents also would never accomodate to me and how i felt which makes me feel extremely unseen and have to put on this act that they tell me is the right way to act when its honestly so tiring. \n\nI dont want to be the kind of person who self diagnoses but I think I have either autism or borderline personality disorder (bpd), this being said with years if extensive and obsessive info searches being done.

But i also started to get bored which is honestly so common with me. \n\nEven back in my like shitty bullshit teenage relationships I always obsessed around them but then got bored easily and would move on to like hyperfocusing and revolving my world around someone.

I feel like I dragged on my previous relationship because I had considered breaking up with him multiple times but I just felt bad, was scared he'd khs or i was scared to get out of comfort. But either way my ex somehow found out about the guy i was talking to and they talked to each other, and honestly i'm not too bothered, but i genuinely feel like im a horrible person. I didnt flirt much with the other guy but i did like a little, and it is my fault for never explicitly mentioning i have a boyfriend and calling him my ex a day or two before we broke up, which he somehow understood as we'd been broken up for a month.

I know how it sounds but her personality hasn't changed. I doubt she started this relationship in any different way than before or thought of it any differently. He just made her feel differently. Hopefully comfortable in comfort.\nI would even say her interest in drama hasn't changed but now she prefers to observe it outside of her own life rather than living in drama herself.

She said she wants more than a thing to be able to do romantic things again, but her body won't let her. We planned on trying a sort of impromptu exposure therapy where every other week we try holding hands and also holding hands during really happy moments to try and get her brain and body to associate that contact with happiness and comfort again rather than more negative emotions.

Firends don't understand. I doubt classmates who also lost thier mothers will. It's a different grief. Loosing my mom so young doesn't mean i \"miss\" her..I have no memory.. the fact I will never know my own mothers voice, her laugh, what its like to hug her, be told she loves me. It's unbearable. \n\nIn 2024 am art teacher I had offered support as many women have to me but I shortly stopped messaging her due to the fact  I am very anxious in person and can't share feeling,  she is often busy and she doesn't reply to my texts cause of it. I understand I can't expect anyone to replace my mother, but I can't deal with the isolation. Even when i did share i often feel like a burden since they arent my mom and have no obligation to care. \n\nI want to be hugged and comforted and I don't have anyone and all I ever think about Is a mother I can't have. I don't have memories to remebr her by, I don't have anything but photos and what others tell me. I don't know what to do anymore, I've tired a depression and anxiety line for my country, but every resource seems like the same coping mechanisms that do nothing.

I was sexually assaulted several times when I was a kid. Always had been down but my mental state shattered during college. All I did was not going to uni (if i had chance to skip) or come home and sleep right after classes without talking to anyone. My grades got terrible, i failed classes because of absence etc.\n\n\n I just wanted to tell you that there is a light behind the tunnel. The things that happened to me, I will never forget but I learnt how to function better and enjoy life like my peers. It is not going to be easy. But you shouldn't forget being gentle to yourself during your healing time. Allow yourself to be sad, don't guilt yourself for not being able to enjoy life. The things you've been though are devastating, so let yourself breathe. You don't need to rush yourself to be happy. I recommend you to surround yourself with people who love you and genuinely care for you, cut the ones who makes you feel worse than you already feel off immediately, taking clinical support helps a lot, a good therapist can make a significant change, don't bottle your emotions up (share them with a therapist if you can or write them down). Give yourself time to recover, it is okay to be sad. The mental state you are in is perfectly normal reaction for what you experienced. \n\n\n\n\nOne last thing, for me therapy and using medications lasted for 5 years. But now I got back to  college and I am about to graduate. At first I felt like i am behind my peers, i still do at times. But I know I've came a long way. Rn I can enjoy life like I haven't before.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "text": "Processing trauma can manifest in a lot of different ways. One way or another, your brain and body are going to process what happened. Why the processing is happening in a particular way is something only you can really figure out - it may be that you associate old habits with the trauma, or want to be a different person to escape it. It may be that the stimulation of engaging in reckless behavior is a way to numb intense emotions. The important thing to remember is that you haven’t lost the person you were or your capabilities. Your system is just trying to compensate for a painful wound. \n\nI strongly suggest seeing a trauma informed therapist. \n\nPersonally I thought I was handling my own issues for about the past decade, and then a recent event showed me I was pretty much just coping through avoidance. I think I would have been in a much better place by now if I had gotten myself some support at the beginning. The professional guidance really does help. \n\nThe university I go to offers free mental health counseling to students - maybe yours has a similar program?

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "title": "My mother is in a psychiatric hospital", "text": "Our relationship has been really difficult for years. To start: I never loved her. She never respected me, and that left me with after-effects of the anxious attachment type. She would check my things, my messages, and my room all the time. She stole things from me like clothes or perfumes and made me feel bad when I bought things with my own money. She has insulted me, threatened to kill herself because of me (without me having done anything, really, she had left my father recently) and made noise with knives outside my door (I was 16). At 14, she invented that there was a p*** video of me circulating, just to know if I had already had relationships (she didn't like my boyfriend at the time). She did it the day I turned 15, so I cried on top of the cake. When my ex-mother-in-law wanted to involve the police to support me, my mother backed down, and that's how I realized it was a lie. A few months ago, she checked my room and found cigarettes, insulted me a lot, and threatened to take away the child support from my father. I left the house for two weeks, living in friends' houses and seeking help from the state, but I didn't find any. I wanted petisuis. She got angry because I told her I was going to leave and told me that being alone was the best thing that could happen to her, and lied that my boyfriend hit her. Yes, out of nowhere. I even recorded her saying that before leaving the house, although I had to go back after a while, unfortunately. These are a few episodes that have happened, to summarize. And I don't remember many. For many years, I was ashamed to have relationships. And that was my life always\n\nA few years ago, she suffered from a labor lawsuit that traumatized and marked her a lot, and I understand, but the mistreatment worsened (although never physical, I would have liked her to do it so I would have a real reason for what I feel). Now I'm 20 years old and I'm living with her, scared, without leaving my room. I spend days without eating so I don't have to go to the kitchen and run into her. I'm disgusted to see her, to hear her. I'm scared. She behaves like a child.\n\nToday I'm 20, and I found out about the hospitalization from my sister, not from her. She didn't tell me she was going to go or that this could happen. She asked my aunt to go get her things and left me completely out of the situation. I live in the same apartment, so now I'm alone. On the one hand, I feel relief (and guilt for feeling it), and on the other, a huge weight.\n\nMy family is going to take care of her, and I feel very afraid of the judgment, as if I were the bad one, without really knowing everything I went through. They are going to give me visiting hours, but I don't know if I want to go. In fact, I know I don't want to go, but if she gets out of the hospitalization and I'm still in her house, she's going to treat me worse. I'm very confused, afraid to see her, wanting to start my life, and I don't know what's right.\n\nAlso, I just got a part-time job (I start next week), I was happy because it's one more step closer to moving away from her and cutting ties, and I'm trying to organize my life and think about starting from scratch, but I feel like my life still depends on what happens to her. Like I'm never going to have control.\n\nI don't know exactly what I'm looking for by writing this. Maybe support or reading experiences of people who have gone through something similar.

I have no degree, I have average GCSEs, couldn’t join the army due to a back injury back in 2017 which is what I wanted to do with my life but had no back up. Moved out at 17 because of abusive alcoholic mother. Got a girlfriend not long after, started a job in manufacturing where her mother works, moved in with her in 2020 and been together since. She’s a lawyer.\n\nI just constantly feel so shit about myself. I’ve been in the same manufacturing job now for 7 and a half years, I reached the highest I could go in my current role 3 years ago, I have tried progressing such as doing a stand in supervisor role twice in a year, as well as talk to managers about progression, only to see my girlfriends sister be considered over me when she started less than a year ago all because her mother pulled some strings and helped her get funded for a uni course which I was in talks with management to get funded for but she got it instead but they didn’t tell me or my girlfriend about it. Since then, both of them blank me in work and make it very awkward as they act like I’m a stranger to them now.\n\nI just feel I’m not getting anywhere and nobody is taking me seriously. To escape, I just jump on my Xbox. But then I scroll through my friends list and see my old school friends who haven’t been on for years because they’ve actually made something of themselves and are living life, whereas I’m sat here in my flat in a rough area playing Xbox with a job that isn’t even a career at this point. The Xbox just makes me reminisce of good old days of being a kid again when I didn’t have any worries about paying rent or trying to start a career, family issues, mental health issues, when I actually had friends I could laugh with everyday.\n\nSometimes I just feel like I’m lost and have wasted my life so far even though I’m only 25 but just seeing everyone else saying how they’ve got degrees, diplomas, completing uni, starting careers, having kids, buying homes etc. god it sucks man!", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767989222.0, "id": "1q8irin", "author": "AlrightMateyBoi", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8irin/i_feel_like_ive_accomplished_nothing_with_my_life/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "title": "This is the story of my life. [TW: ẞA, SH, ABUẞE, ATTEMPT]", "text": "It all started when i was still a kid. Maybe 5, or 6. It all begin when my family started fighting with eachother because of money, property and buisness. These fights quickly turned into abuse. Blood, hitting, and verbal abuse. I used to be clueless at first, innocent and unable to comprehend what was happening. Slowly when i began understanding, i would go sit in a corner, cry, or lock the door and be alone. My mom would always break down due to the fighrs, and my family was always tortured. There was alot of pain. At the same time, at school, i was being bullied by the school's \"popular rich\" girls. And for the rest of the kids, i didn't exist. I used be bullied for not being rich, for being quiet, and not fitting in. Half of the memories that my classmates still talk about are things i listen and nod to but don't remember. I simply was never there. I used to be a skinny girl. I had iron deficiency, i never looked like i had life in me. Always told i am ugly and built like a stick. And then in my childhood my mother tried to kill me. She locked me in a room, choking me for a few minutes until grandma came to save me. She was the only decent one in the family. But she is dead now. I miss grandma. I got ẞA'd by my mum when i was about 6 after school during a nap. And ever since then i got ẞA'd by my cousins as well. This lasted for 3/4 years. Till i was 10 i think. For a while, till i was 14, my brain had blocked this memory, that these things had been done to me. Suddenly at 15, i remembered. It was as if it happened to me again. It affected me BAD. Now i am 15. And i am FUCKED. I even self harmed but i am 1 year clean although the scar on my wrist stayed forever.\n\nI took care of my looks alor, and now i am the popular pretty girl in school, and everyone thinks i am a slut. Or maybe thats just whag i think of myself as. I am not worth more than that. I am worth nothing more than being a useless whore. Although i have never had a relationship except for one, and no physical intimacy except for what happened, i still think i am a bitch. I can't say no to men, continuesly manipulated. \n\n\nBut am i ? Am i a slut?\n\nI want to be held gently. \n\nIs that too much to ask for? Fuck...\n\nSo what is happening now is that now that all this shit has it, and it is 2026, and i am loosing it. Not popular anymore, well known, but quiet. I built myself different, i changed, but now i am back to zero, now that it's all come back. It's been getting worse.

It all started a few months ago when he stopped letting kids leave the class. I have accommodations for anxiety which lets me leave the class on a certain schedule which teachers can’t refuse. So I figured that I could still leave so when I asked he said no then I asked why and he said “I want you to stay here” so I just left because I was about to pass out from a panic attack and I told my irt teacher about what happened and she had a chat with him and I never had another issue, until yesterday he said no again so I said it’s my quiet space accommodation and you have to let me go to which he said it’s pretty quiet in here to which I just left because the irt teacher told me too. I tell her about the whole thing and and she’s pretty upset. Then the period ends so I had to go to my next class and when I entered all the people start starting at me and were saying rude comments saying “accommodations are for Pusey’s” I didn’t know what brought that up so I didn’t think about it until my friend come up and apparently after I left the teacher went on this whole rant saying I was disrespectful, there is no pass in high school and I needed to wake up to the real world. The next day when I had math my schedule didn’t allow me to go to my spot so I went to the guidance councillors and I was then told that he cares about me which is complete bs so it was kinda left at that and I was told to stay for instruction (which I did) and he won’t get mad. I was distraught about that and felt hopeless so the next day when I had math I could leave because it’s my schedule and he let me and when I got there my pass teacher told me that even if I have a panic attack and I’m not scheduled to be with irt I have to stay. I was beyond furious and then I started to cry and she was upset about it too because she tried so hard and no action was taken .later in the day the  principal called called me down and said if I keep this up I could lose my accommodations to which I said I have crippling anxiety and me leaving isn’t “skipping” it’s self preservation. So it was left at that as she just told me to go back to class to which I had the worst anxiety I’ve had in months and was to the brink of passing out when my social studies teacher gave me water and helped me out. When I got home I had a full mental breakdown and and was screaming and crying at the fact that I’m completely hopeless and my only way out is the mental hospital or death. I’m completely terrified of him and after this I don’t know if I can ever forgive him or the school.\nThere’s were issues at home as well so the day this all happened I just started a new adhd medication and my mom is very against medication and she’s claims I experience different side effects which I don’t at all and they help me really well. But my mom completely ignored my fucked up day and blamed it all on the meds. She said it’s what’s making me anxious and causing me to overreact when it was literally the worst days of the year in school and barely gave any compassion and said I need to stay in class and have panic attacks in the class instead of leaving. She then started talking about how her day was horrible because she had to do things at home and I got it easy.

But don’t worry, I’ll get to the negatives-I just have to get the positives out there first: I’m an accomplished woodworker, have written a novel, completed an associates degree in business, and most people in my inner circle consider me to be extremely intelligent. \n\nThe negatives:\n\nI let my anxiety rule the first half of my life, wherein I really never did anything worthwhile outside of playing music. I’ve pigeonholed myself into working mainly retail management jobs, which has been OK, but it has showcased the worst parts of myself-the parts of my personality that is the reason for this post.\n\nEverywhere I work, no matter what type of retail or restaurant, I’ve always been treated an invalid or a village idiot. When my supervisor shouts something from across the sales floor, everyone else understands it but me. Everyone else can look at a planogram or receive simple instructions, and immediately know what to do. Not me. Everyone else seems to get it and understand, whereas I keep making simple mistakes, silly screw ups, or foreseeable problems that I never catch onto.\n\nIt’s torture, because I know that I’m an intelligent person, but every day I have to go into a job where I know everyone’s rolling their eyes and looking at me like “here comes the idiot”. I’ve noticed this once in a while throughout my childhood, young adulthood, and now well into my 30s. \n\nWhat is wrong with me? Do I have undiagnosed autism? Some kind of processing disorder? I’m just sick and tired of having to spend so much more energy and mental cognition just to function up to par with everyone else. It’s essentially constant maintenance to make sure I’m not being an idiotic, living cartoon character. I’m tired of it, whatever this mystery cognitive issue is that has been holding me back my entire life. I’m social, I laugh, and carry on conversations with people and don’t have any issues being around others. It’s like I’m just cursed to be an idiot.\n\nFeel free to critique and tell me what you guys think, I’m at a loss.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767986304.0, "id": "1q8hhyn", "author": "TheCuriousMonke333", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8hhyn/tired_of_being_this_way/"}

Basically: you’re not horny, you’re stuck.\n\nAnd I’m like… okay, but what does that mean for ADHDers and bipolars?\n\nFor ADHD: sex can become a dopamine shortcut when everything else feels flat.\nFor bipolar: during hypomania/mania, libido can spike and judgement can tank and sex becomes gasoline, not release.\n\nSo Reich’s “orgasm as cure” can sound seductive: just discharge the tension and you’ll be okay. But if your brain is chasing stimulation, the release can turn into compulsion, shame, and relationship damage, and sometimes it’s literally a mood episode waving a giant red flag.\n\nIn my opinion, Reich’s take, filtered through ADHD/bipolar reality, is basically this:\nsex can be medicine, but it can also be a symptom.

We are students in one group in university. At first he was really sweet and caring to everyone. He is the type of person to spend hours driving a drunk person from a party to their home and walk sick student to their house from university, even though that student live pretty far away. Plus we had a lot of common themes to talk about and he never once acted weird around women. So when he asked me to date him i said yes after some hesitation.\nAfter that he changed completely. He kissed me forcefully. First time i let it slide, because i thought it was normal (i live in a conservative and patriarchal country). But later i told him im uncomfortable with that since it was the first day of dating. I told him multiple times that i want to take thing slow and that im uncomfortable with everything related to intimacy and kissing. I told him i liked being hugged, maybe caressed, but i i made my boundaries clear for a few times. Each time he apologised, but continued touching me inappropriately, like slapping or pinching my ass, groping, pinning me to the walls or a bed (i invited him over to watch a movie, actually meaning a movie, since we did it even before dating, just as a friends) so i couldn't really fight, kissing me forcefully, touching me where it made me uncomfortable. Few times i had to physically push him away to try to make him stop. And he talked only about sex. \nI obviously dumped himafter few of those instances. We never even been on the dates and he still acted like i owed him my body now. The worst part is that i cant cut him off, since we are a part of the same friend circle and are in the same study group. He keeps showing up everywhere i go if we have plans in the group chat and he sees that i go too, even if he wouldn't go to those places/events before. \nNow i feel so gross with my body and everywhere he touched me.

My mother(the only family member i opened up to) told me that all men are like that and what was i expecting when agreed to date, so basically, she sees nothing wrong and even blames me for breaking his heart.\nI know its stupid to vent, since he didn't r*pe me so its probably nothing serious.

On the off-chance you are involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, that’s the only time you will be forced, in which case you could comply, get let out as quickly as possible, and stop taking the meds. Quitting psych meds cold turkey is bad though. Trust me, I’ve done it. \n\nI’ve spent the last ~5yrs unmedicated (basically since I turned 18 because before that I didn’t really have a choice) when realistically I probably shouldn’t be.

Society does not get to chemically alter people just because they are unconventional, difficult, or uncomfortable to be around. There is no obligation to “function in society” according to passive cultural expectations, especially in private life or off the clock.\n\nThat right changes only under very specific conditions.\n\nWhen a severe mental health condition significantly impairs a person’s ability to understand reality or evaluate risk, and when that impairment creates a credible danger to themselves or others, the issue shifts from social conformity to capacity and safety. In those cases, temporary, legally regulated treatment may be required to reduce risk and restore the person’s ability to make their own decisions.\n\nThis is not about enforcing behavior standards or chemical compliance. It’s about preventing serious harm when illness removes the ability to choose safely. Once capacity is restored, the justification for intervention ends, and the person’s right to refuse treatment resumes.\n\nIf someone is unconventional, socially nonconforming, or difficult but still capable of managing risk, there is no ethical or legal basis for forced medication.\n\n.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767991041.0, "id": "nynweh9", "author": "hateboresme"}

I had realized I was sleeping my weekends away simply because I didn’t want to be awake. I have always slept a lot due to some previous issues in middle school so my average is more like 9-10, but I don’t sleep ignoring food and health for literal days when i am feeling good. I often describe my mental health as a place or world where everyone lives happily, but an atmosphere of fear and silence permeates because in a far off corner in the shadows of my mind is a cage. In the cage is a monster or beast bound in chains and locks just sleeping. No one wants to wake it up, because once it wakes up it will easily break its restraints and bend the bars to run havoc. I am worried that whatever is in the cage is stirring. I am scared because I have been able to keep it under control for the past year, but I feel that hold slipping and I worry about what might happen when this monster in my head starts rampaging and I have no control or ability to stop it on my own. \nI don’t know when it started , like I often do when I start slipping, but I am doubting myself everytime I do something. Do I actually like this or just want to? Am I actually feeling this way or am I just showing an emotion others expect me to? Who am I really if my entire personality is constructed to show a person I want others to see? Do I actually have depression? ADHD? What about the anxiety? \nI can’t seem to stop these thoughts from flowing into my mind everytime I have a moment to think. I used to bottle up all my unwanted feelings and thoughts until I exploded in an ugly and very dramatic breakdown, dragging anyone around me into it. I really thought I had moved past this years ago, but what if I fell into old habits without noticing? I try not to think to deeply about my health due to it starting this very thought process of self doubt. I guess I chose blissful ignorance to allow myself to swim through the sea of dark thoughts that I now will never really go away.\nI am holding onto my stable points and am praying the storm will pass. My dog who makes me feel needed and loved unconditionally, family time with my parents so I can feel that I am not alone, and look at my mantra tattooed on my wrist to remind me of my worth, “Every drop leaves ripples”. (Being able to know that ‘Even if my life is just a drop in a bucket, every drop leaves ripples’ is probably one of the best things to ever happen to my mental health.) \n\nI really do hope I am not lying to myself about who I really am, but in the end hope or not if that monster wakes up there is nothing I can do to stop it.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767978160.0, "id": "1q8dsrq", "author": "JoJoBee2256", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8dsrq/worried_about_a_mental_crack/"}

I started documenting everything in a notebook kept under my bed, writing down every night what I felt during the day and who might have been the person whose emotions I was feeling.\nI tried to explain this to my old therapist, who diagnosed me with schizophrenia and prescribed very high doses of medication. This landed me in the hospital, living like a vegetable for an entire year of my life (keep in mind I was only 12 years old at the time).\nAfter that long year—of which I still don't remember much, and likely never will—I was admitted to the best hospital in my country. There, they diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and told my parents that I was not schizophrenic. About a year ago, while scrolling through TikTok, I saw a clip from an American TV series where a girl felt other people's pain just by looking at them. The only difference was that she only felt their physical pain, whereas I apparently feel their emotions.\nAfter that, I discovered that this is called Mirror-Touch Synesthesia (MTS). It is a neurological condition where a person physically and mentally experiences the sensations of others within their own body and mind.\nIt can also cause nervous breakdowns, which I have often, and I don't know what to do.

Please, I'm not a narcissist. I know the world doesn't revolve around me. But yet I'm still paranoid? And going back to school made me more paranoid..? am I a narcissist?\n\nI've been acting avoidant this week, too. I go on long walks to set aside the emptiness, that hollow feeling. I try to walk with the posture and stride of somebody with direction in life. I radiate confidence, I seem okay. But I'll admit, I'm not okay. \n\nI emailed my psychologist the day after my birthday. I thanked him for the gift, and then followed up w/ a termination request. \n\nIt isn't working, therapy isn't helping.\nI'm wasting your time.\nI don't want you to feel complicit in my destructive actions.\n\nI was pushing away and I don't know why. He said that's fine and our next meeting can be the last, should my decision remain the same. I think it will—I don't know if i want it to be, but I don't want to be the boy who called wolf. I made my bed, so I must now lay in it.\n\nI just don't know why I was so impulsive, and does he perhaps know my decision was so? The first line in the response was, \"I can see you put a lot of thought and effort into this decision.\" which made me laugh, for obvious reasons. Can you tell I'm in a crisis? Well hell, if you can't tell then maybe I _shouldn't_ be seeing you! I'm sorry, I'm being mean—I'm just upset. I'm pulling back. \n\nI've also been self destructive. Emotionally charged, I cut my self a lot. Some lacerations need checking as I can see fat inside the wound, and they gape like eyes. maybe they're watching me, urging me, to do more? Now that I've thought this thought, it'll probably encourage another episode. Sometimes I cheer myself on with those thoughts; \n\n\"Do a swipe for each time you bailed, bitch.\"\n\"C'mon, you can do _better_! nobody gives a fuck, so what's the worst that can happen?\"\n\"kill yourself.\"\n\"Go slower, push harder, the pain is good. that means it's working.\"\n\"go deeper so they don't think about you anymore. It's the only way.\"\n\nMy thoughts are contradictory—illogical. And yet i become emotionally charged and gain the confidence to go deeper. But wow, the morning after, it hurts. _why did I do that?_ Well, at least I'm untethered by my psychologist so logically don't need to follow the safety plan, right? At least I don't need stitches, but I probably need stitches.\n\nWow, I'm so tired. And I still don't know what's wrong with me.", "score": 7, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767976166.0, "id": "1q8cvsu", "author": "AdventurousAd6702", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8cvsu/turning_20_is_hard_tw_si_sh/"}

I kept my phone in a drawer so that if I really needed to use it I could go ahead, but I wouldn't get urges by simply seeing my phone.\n\n2- Making activities harder to do: I increased the number of steps in between me and doing bad habits (scrolling, texting, etc.) by deleting TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat. It's honestly funny- just like that, my brain thought it was too much effort to go to the App Store and reinstall them.\n\n3- Gradually decreasing: This is probably the most important point. Whenever I went on dopamine detoxes, I'd usually succeed but then fall right back into my bad habits. Then, I kept introducing more beneficial activities into my life (joining a sports club, starting content creation, working out) and gradually over time, I got used to using my phone less. Cold turkey just didn't work for me.\n\n4- Purpose: Definitely the aspect I overlooked the most. I was trying to quit my phone addiction even though I had basically no main motivation behind it. Basically, I was unambitious and never really considered setting huge dreams for myself. I know, this may seem irrelevant but trust me, just set big goals for your life. Then, you'll understand each and every way your phone usage is hindering your progress.\n\nHope this helps, take action ;)", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767983517.0, "id": "nyn4ssc", "author": "Weak_Dust_7654"}

I would just attack myself over and over again in my head. I still have those episodes but they aren't as all-encompassing/overwhelming , just painful and scary. I think I'm mostly able to hide it. I don't say it aloud to myself as often as I think it, but sometimes saying it aloud feels almost cathartic, and other times it's like it bubbles up from deep inside me through my throat. I've said it aloud without intending to multiple times, and I've been afraid that when I'm spiraling I'll blurt it out someone will hear it and theyll think I was aiming it at them. Which just makes me more anxious.\n\n Anyway I was on the phone and I was making an appointment right after leaving a different appointment and I was just in a state of anxiety and self hatred. I was put on hold and it just blurted out, I think because subconsciously I felt it as a minute to myself to take and release the anxiety and feel the pain. But immediately I'm horrified that they might have heard and thought I was being cruel to them. I hung up and made the appointment a bit later. But I'm just so worried that I said something cutting to them and I'm terrified that it's not getting better it's getting worse and it feels like I'm just backsliding when I'm already behind. It feels useless to try when I'm just going nowhere anyway. Im tired of struggling just to function normally and then fuck it up anyway. Not going to kms but I'm just so fed up with myself.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "title": "I Want to Finally Change My Life", "text": "I’m a 17y old in my senior year of highschool, and for the past 3 years i’ve had self-esteem issues. I’ve been so obsessed with my weight to the point that i’ve developed eating disorders (BED, Bulimia). At the beginning of my weight loss journey, I was losing weight at a steady pace and doing it in a healthy way, but I began wanting the process to go faster. I dropped down to 134lbs (I was still considered overweight) and my goal was and is 120. I didn’t look fat, I was only a bit chubby but it wasn’t very noticeable under the clothes I wore. Despite that, I felt like I wasn’t skinny enough. I began learning “tips” and “tricks” on how to lose weight and got sucked into diet culture. I began fasting, but if i’m being honest, it was more like starvation. Because of that, my binge eating episodes began and there was one time when I ate so much I ended up vomiting the next day. Then it hit me, if i ate a lot of everything I wanted, i could just vomit it the next day and not gain any weight. Unfortunately this mindset only made my BED worse. I would go to sleep with my stomach bloated and full of food and the next day I could still feel the food. It felt horrible, I felt fat and disgusted. I gained 30 pounds in just a few months and with that, my mental health declined. I’ve had motivation to work out and be active, but everytime I did, I would push myself too hard and then fall back into binge eating and laying in bed all day. At some point, I attempted to make myself puke, and once I did, I would do it occasionally. About 5 months ago, I began making myself puke more consistently, almost everyday. This month my body has become too weak to let out all the food at a daily rate, so I’ve begun gaining some weight again after losing 15 pounds. I’ve tried being active again and again but I give up after a few days due to lack of motivation and probably nutrition. I hate making myself vomit and i’m tired of it taking over my life, but i’ve become so dependent on it that I feel horrible and disgusted if I feel any ounce of food in my stomach. So, I’m going to hold myself accountable and change my life for once. I don’t want to make plans that I don’t follow through anymore. I don’t want to give up anymore, I’ve imagined a good life for so long, yet never did anything to get there. This year I truly believe that I can recover and finally get myself in good shape, not just for looks, but to improve my mental and physical health. If anyone could give me some helpful tips or advice, especially about maintaining consistency, I’d really appreciate it\n\nAdditional info: I am a 5’3 transgender male (not on Testosterone) and my weight fluctuates from 150-155. The whole reason I became obsessed with my weight was so I could look masculine. When I gain weight, I tend to get bigger in parts that make my body look more feminine, which alters the way I view myself negatively . Along with that, I wanted to match beauty standards for romantic attention, but I believe I’m straying further away from that mentality, thankfully.\n\nI’m not sure if there are better subreddits to post this on, so if there is, please share them. Thank you!", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767972691.0, "id": "1q8bbk5", "author": "Anonymouss3xylad", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1q8bbk5/i_want_to_finally_change_my_life/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "text": "First, do you know about different types of therapists and the type you’re looking for? Are you wanting to address a specific issue? Or more broadly work on understanding yourself and improving the way you relate to the world? \n\nI’ve been to many therapists over the years (currently studying to be one myself). I’ve been with my current one (a psychoanalyst -  but not so much old school “lay on the couch” style) for about a year and this is the best fit for me. I know the CBT techniques. I wanted something deeper and more exploratory than “fixing”. \n\nThe first step with any therapist would be to openly express the concerns you listed here. Ask them for ideas… this will, again, depend on the type of therapist you work with. For some, there’s a lot of “back and forth”, for others, part of the goal is to become comfortable “free-associating” and just freely talk - literally anything that comes to mind - even “I’m feeling anxiety because I don’t know what else to talk about and feel awkward that we still have half the session left”. Sometimes saying this will “associate” another thought or memory “I struggle with this at family gatherings…I feel awkward and then I worry about…” \n\nI started therapy sessions with my most recent therapist by bringing in actual lists of topics I’d gathered through the week. Eventually, she addressed this and encouraged me to practice free-associating more - or at least closing my notebook and just going off memory. For a few (virtual) sessions, I used random tarot cards (I don’t do tarot but happen to have cards) to prompt what they made me think of. You can also do this with movies, quotes, images/paintings/art. The goal is not to just describe it, but to see what it makes you think/feel/remember… I also use this strategy for journaling sometimes. \n\nFinally, it’s hard to define what it would mean to “suck” or “be good” at therapy. There are so many factors at play, and it’s NORMAL to feel uncomfortable and stuck/not knowing what to say. Your history of changing/dropping therapists is common. I ghosted many therapists over the years - turns out this was also indicative of how I handled anxiety and self-consciousness in many relationships in my life. My current therapist knows this, so it’s been a focus for us (even/especially when I skip a couple weeks, feel guilty, and then come back - this is part of my patterns I am in therapy for). \n\nFirst step is figuring out the type of therapist you want and finding a good fit. Do a trial session with a few - not all therapists are right for each person. They vary dramatically. \n\nYou’ve got this :)", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767973529.0, "id": "nym3lfn", "author": "PurpleAd6354"}

I spent 4 weeks in the hospital where I was watched and managed. I have taken a range of prescribed medication for treatment and have tried 3-4 different psychiatrists and countless psychologists. I am now 20 and have managed to gain a lot of control and independence in my life. This took a serious amount of work and trust building though...\n\nNow,\n\nAs I enter 2026 I am extremely grateful and am looking forward to the future. I can confidently say 2025 was the best year of my life. The craziest thing is, 2024 was one of the worst years of my life. I came very close to relapsing and losing it all. \n\nThe most important take away for me, is to find a support network that works for you. I have had amazing doctors and terrible doctors. My hospital experience was awful, but it lead to me finding the most amazing mental health nurse who became the driving force in the early steps of my recovery.\n\nToo many people think therapy is a “one size fits all”. Personally I think this couldn’t be more wrong. I HATE therapy where all they do is try and fix my problems. Most of the time I know what needs to be done or why the problems are happing… I just want to feel validated and have someone listen to what I have to say.\n\nSome words of encouragement. Believe yourself, you know yourself better than anyone. If you feel a doctor isn’t giving you the support you need. Change doctors!! There are so many wonderful people out there, you just need to find the perfect one.\n\nI spent 2025 in 7 different counties, working in each one. I moved out. Ended a 3 year long relationship on good terms. In 2020 a doctor told my mum that I would never be independent and would be medicated for the rest of my life. This couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nAs a final note, about a year ago I had my diagnosed removed.\nThis was a hard choice but was one my psych suggested. I was very high functioning compared to other people with schizophrenia and also wanted to prevent any potential stigma as I got older. At that stage I didn't fit the diagnosis requirements anymore so in the end I was happy to let it go.\n\nAs I enter my 20s I now feel that it’s the end of an era.

Please be kind…I’m sensitive as you might gather later lol \n\n35 yrs old, female. So, I find myself at my 3rd job in 5 years with the same issue I’ve faced before - I get frustrated and overwhelmed easily, I struggle to hide my irritation/frustration and ultimately my coworkers begin to feel uncomfortable with my unpredictable moods and seemingly negative attitude (justifiably so!). \n\nA little back story, I’ve struggle with mental health my whole life. I threw world ending temper tantrums as a kid, well past when I should’ve stopped, and if I’m honest, that’s kind of what still happens now. It feels pretty much the same. The lack of emotional control has touched every part of my life- my husband is a freaking saint because I can switch up in an instant. He’s told me it’s like whip lash. And it can be over a small thing, like someone cutting me off in traffic or me being frustrated with all the housework. It’s like I get a little annoyed and it builds into an explosion. Sometimes, I just rant and rave (feels like rumination out loud vs in your head) Sometimes I complain and will throw something or slam my fist (NEVER at my husband or anyone else for that matter. I haven’t ever hurt anyone or aimed my anger at someone). I am a rather sensitive person meaning I take these personally and can struggle with criticism. Shit, I get annoyed when people comment on small things like what I’m eating or how odd it is I’m wearing ankle jeans in winter. \n\nThe frustrating and confusing part is at my heart I love people and want to be open and outgoing. It just feels like once my shitty side comes out, there’s never any fixing it or getting past it. To be clear- I have never thrown anything or slammed my fists at work, but at past jobs I have gotten in trouble for being short and rude with people I didn’t like or I am seen as a bad attitude because I get frustrated when I make a mistake and can get annoyed. \n\nTo add an additional layer, I have an incredibly negative internal critic and that has made everything worse. It’s like I live in victim mode- it tells me everyone has it easier than me, is better off than me and everyone hates me or judges me. I become angry and then the other side of the internal critic starts saying mean shit TO me, like “no one has ever really liked you. They’re always faking it and just tolerating you. You’re awful to be around and are lucky anyone pretends to love you”. Again- struggled with this since I can remember. I cry at a moments notice, probably 5 days a week I cry about something.  I struggled with passive suicidal ideation and used to self harm from 13-21. Still think about it sometimes and I’m 35, so that’s no normal lol \n\nI KNOW this behavior is immature and unacceptable. It has ruined friendships, jobs, romantic relationships and even strains my familial relationships because I can be emotionally overwhelming. I have searched all over the internet, met with different mental health providers and gotten so many conflicting answers, that I feel lost. My next step is to see about putting myself into a psych hold just to get answers (don’t have money for a facility unfortunately). I know my grandmother struggled and I absolutely learned my irritability patterns from my Dad, but they feel like a symptom of something rather than just who I am, if that makes sense. \n\nAny insight or help is very much appreciated.

I was also really lonely. During this time, I did something I feel horrible about.\n\nOne day, I asked a girl I knew out on a date — asking if she wanted to go on a date — and she said yes. So we met up. After walking around a bit, I told her my house was empty and asked if she wanted to come over. She said yes, and we both went to my house.\n\nThen we started kissing, and suddenly I just ended up hugging her. After a while, she said she had to go, but I wouldn't let go. She then tried her best to free herself, but I grabbed her and hugged her again for a long time. After a while, I realized what I was doing was bad (or maybe I always knew) and let her go.\n\nShe was really polite throughout all of this, and I feel I have to add that I know for a fact I had no intention of hurting her or doing anything horrible like that. But from her perspective, it must have been terrifying.\n\nI was too worried to message her after that, obviously, and she never messaged me.\n\nIt wasn't until last year that I started going to therapy and got diagnosed with ADHD etc. that I really started to come back to myself and realize how crazy I was acting in the years before. But this interaction has been scaring me ever since.\n\nI'm too scared of joining clubs or going to events because she might be there. I'm scared of even going around the city with friends because she might be there. I'm even scared she'll see this post.\n\nI realize that I deserve to feel this way, and what I did was horrible.\n\nI really do hope she's okay. And most of all, I just hope I'm remembering it all wrong.\n\nI sent her an apology message yesterday, but she hasn't replied so far (which is reasonable). I also realize that there is definitely a selfish element to me hoping she'll forgive me, but she is an amazing person, and I really hope I didn't hurt her mental health.\n\nThis is probably irrelevant, but I'm also confused as to why she's still following me on Instagram.

So just gonna give my tips that worked for me as someone now in college with ADHD.\n\nSo first of all it sounds as if you are maybe asking too much of yourself. It’s really hard to study in highschool specifically because you can just kinda get your way through it (I barely studied in highschool to be totally honest). But if you wanna develop some study skills you need to drop the bar.\n\nStart with just 15 minutes a day and work up from there. You have a small attention span and most likely studying isn’t hitting your dopamine right. If you want to increase focus time, then you can try a few things, biggest game changers for me outside of meds are meditation, working out, and HIGH PROTEIN DIETS. Like seriously, chug like 40g of protein from a shake or some other source before your day starts and your brain is going to feel amazing.\n\nOther than that lower the bar for everything you want to do. Workout? 5 minutes is fine. Also if you wanna do long study sessions, go between subjects every 20-30 minutes. I cycle through my 5 college classes like this and it keeps each of them interesting because the most my brain can focus on one boring subject (like history) is about 20 minutes.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "text": "The things you are describing are quite typical of a normal and healthy teenager.\n\nYou are obviously quite intelligent, and you have learned over time how to harness the skills you have, in last minute prep.  \n\nOver time your brain has learned that it doesn’t need to take school work seriously, it doesn’t need to do things before the last minute because it can do things well in very little time.  Our brains are very efficient and  will do what it can to preserve itself, it’s nit going to give you the motivation to study for a week, if it doesn’t need to, your brain would consider that ti be wasted mental energy.\n\nYou can make all the planners, to do lists and study timetables in the world, but it won’t work if your brain has already discovered that it doesn’t need them.  Are you trying to study because people tell you it’s important,  or because you feel you should?  If you are still doing well, then it’s not something to stress about,\n\nLots people people (parents/teachers) will tell you “Well if you don’t develop good study habits now, you’ll never be able to do it when things start to get hard, like in College”.  But, for very intelligent people, that’s just not true.  Your brain will figure out what it needs to do, when the time comes.\n\nProcrastination is actually also a very, very common trait of highly intelligent people, and it’s not truly a bad thing.  If you are given and assignment and you do the assignment straight away, then you only have the things you already know to draw on for that assignment.  If you are given an assignment and you wait until it’s quite late to do it, then the assignment is sitting at the back of your mind for a few weeks.  Without even realising you are doing it, your brain will be putting ideas together, drawing on things it sees and hears in life, and by the time you come to do it, you have so much more information to draw on than the person who did it quickly.\n\nHighly intelligent people also tend to have quite intense emotions.  Imagine our brain is like a magnet, the average brain is like an average magnet, metal things will stick to it if they get too close, but it’s nit goimhnti be pulling metal things off the walls.  Then imagine you have a super strong and powerful magnet, it may drag metal objects from every where to stick to it.

I’m not saying those things aren’t present as well, just that yiu haven’t mentioned them.\n\nADHD is a brain disorder, so the symptoms are always present et from birth, extreme impairment, are seen from a very early age.

My parents either pretend not to know what going on or they genuinely can’t see something is wrong, mind you every time I’ve gone to get help from them I get told “maybe you should stop taking things so personally” or a new favourite of mine “stop being so sensitive”. My grandparents are the nicest people ever but also extremely out of touch, which means I get asked questions like “have you been seeing anyone?”, “how’s work?” Still unemployed btw and the one that hurts the most is “what have you and your friends been getting up to lately” every time I hear those words I just instantly deflate because god bless their souls but what am I going to say to them? “Sorry grandpa your grandson actually has no friends, is unemployed, and “chopped” (for lack of a better term)”. \n\n\nRecently it’s been getting exponentially worse. \n\nMy parents have started to yell at me to get a job even though I’ve tried every method out there minus finding the CEO. I get constantly compared to my older brother with bullshit like “look at him, he found a full time job out of high school and is already a team lead” mind you he was given the job from our cousin and “at least he’s productive”. \n\nBut physically? The worst thing is that I’ve been high or drunk every night since November 10th and that too has gotten progressively worse. I’m addicted to it and I know it’s wrong but being high or drunk is mostly the only counter I’ve found so that I’m not left alone with my thoughts. \n\nI’m tired of living like this \n\nI need to know what options I’ve got/how people have used to pull themselves out of this or if this is just what being a teenager is like because I’m seriously weighing some depressing options here\n\n(Sorry for the trauma dump I really needed to talk to SOMEBODY about this)", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767951260.0, "id": "nykh2si", "author": "xwelikefortnite69420"}

No harm in that. You don't need to have \"full\" OCD as a disorder in order to have OCD symptoms. GAD and OCD often overlap. One causing symptoms of the other. But one is still dominant. Though you can also just have both disorders. \n\nYou need to understand that at the core it's from having low tolerance of uncertainty. That results in your fight or flight being triggered very easilly. That's what causes anxiety. The anxiety then causes the need to do something about it to make it stop. For example making sure how what you're afraid of isn't going to happen or to somehow get away from what you're afraid of. And when you do that, you further reinforce your low tolerance of uncertainty. It works like addiction. Do you understand the logic of this? It's improtant to understand it.\n\nAnd the radical acceptance technique. That means telling yourself how if what you're afraid of happens, it's fine. As if you don't care. No matter how terrible it would actually be. Being like \"So what?\" about it. This works as outsmarting the fear.\n\nAt all times you should let the feeling of anxiety to come and stay, not try to resist it or distract yourself from it.\n\nAlso it's crucial you get enough sleep regularly, that affects anxiety a lot.

Antidepressants like Citalopram often help general anxiety and depression, but not so much compulsions and other OCD symptoms.\n\nYou first and foremost need to work on not acting on the worrying. So things like the checking of security cameras for example. Maybe you can check once in a while, but only what could be considered reasonable. It's good to give yourself some limit and rules. For example set times when you check and then make effort not to check outside of that. You need to become comfortable with not acting on your fear.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "mentalhealth", "text": "To be honest, I have a rather unique perspective on what it means to be \"clean.\" I also started using various substances because I needed to heal something that had been weighing heavily on me since childhood. And I really drifted off the rails a bit, shooting heroin intravenously, whenever possible with cocaine and a pill to maximize the effect. I was also on benzos and drinking heavily. Eventually, I couldn't handle all that crap anymore. I was constantly in and out of the hospital detoxing, sometimes involuntarily because I was simply admitted, and then there was the constant stress of making sure I at least had the three substances I needed to stay sane. Of course, I realized I couldn't go on like that, but I finally went into inpatient therapy one last time. I have to say, though, that I ended up in Fleckenbühl without knowing what I was getting myself into, because it's more of a community of survivors who have sworn off everything, and there were no detox medications available, and cigarettes were forbidden. It wasn't until I was there that I realized I was in a cult. An offshoot of Synanon, the cult run by Christiane F. Then I experienced the worst three months of my life because I had to endure everything cold. If I'd had the strength, I would have left, but I couldn't.\n\nAnd after I got through it all, I swore to myself I'd never use heroin again, never drink alcohol, and I've avoided benzodiazepines ever since. But in retrospect, I realized that I'm ill and need treatment, but I'm not getting any. And under these circumstances, I can't share the same understanding of a drug-free life as doctors or similar people. So I decided that I would no longer get high.\n\nAnd that's what I'm doing now. I take amphetamines as a stimulant for my ADHD, borderline personality disorder, and depression, and I smoke weed occasionally. I have to admit that sometimes I smoke a bit more than medically necessary, but it's within reason. I'm not on any kind of substitution therapy or anything like that. I've always been on my own.\n\nI also have to admit that I keep two fentanyl tablets in reserve. I don't take them, but it gives me peace of mind knowing they're there if I need them. But just because I do it that way doesn't mean I don't approve of you going through with it.
