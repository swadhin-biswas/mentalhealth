We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  \n\nOur new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.\n\n*****\n\n###Summary###\n\n**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** \n\n\n\"PM me anytime\" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.\n\n* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  \n\n* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. \n\n* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  \n\n* In our observation over many years, the people who say \"PM me\" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  \n\n*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.\n\n* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.", "score": 2363, "num_comments": 177, "created_utc": 1572360722.0, "id": "doqwow", "author": "SQLwitch", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/"}

OP should write the first PM which is very hard as many would feel like they are bothering the commenter are that they don’t deserve the time and attention.  \n  \nIt would only make sense if people first made a comment about OP’s situation or thoughts, ask some questions and only then end their message with “PM me if you want to answer privately”. Now OP won’t feel bad for PM-ing someone because the commenter asked them a question so OP doesn’t initiate a conversation — it has already been initiated. As you said, it’s better not to offer to PM and as it’s a rule now nobody should do it — I’m just saying that this was one of the reasons to implement the rule so if someone is commenting on another similar subreddit (where “PM me” is allowed) try to write more than that, ask questions and discuss the topic before you offer to PM.  \n  \nAlso seeing the same, standardized answers (even if some important meaning is hiding behind them) may make you feel really bad both as an OP or as a lurker.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "depression", "text": "*Let Me Add My Thoughts with this, I've  must confess I didn't  read the whole post* (or the wiki, wanna check it out later, full focused  in it, I'm  kinda busy rn xp, I promise)  *and I will appreciate  greatly all kinds of feedbacks you all would like to give me. Well, with your permission:\n\nI've suffered depression/been depressed since I was around 10 yo until this year's  February (2019).\n(Major depressive disorder, severe depression, you name it. The first  condition it's only a raw translation from my native language to English, although it may be different as the actual English name, sorry if I've made a mistake)\n\nI don't  want to offend anyone here or make this condition appear to be worse than it really is, but for me, it was Hell. Perhaps I'm  lacking the proper words to describe it but for me it feels/felt like that.\nAround the same age ( I've  started  my toxic relationship with depression) I've  developed anxiety disorder, I'm  still struggling/fighting against that B****.  A nasty combo.\n\nFor some reason unknown, even for myself, in some moment in that time I've started to think about both conditions as females, ladies, nothing against them obviously, they are more beautiful than men,  proved they are more intelligent than men and without the ladies we are just savages, love them all. Xp \n\nNow, as an adult (25 years old, male) I've took a phrase for myself, it says, more or less:\n\n\"Depression is nothing more than a sad lady knocking at our door in a rainy night. Let her in and listen carefully what she has to say, but do not let her stay. Once the rain has stopped, say goodbye to her.\nOtherwise, she *Will* get into every corner of your house( Inner me, mind, etc), and kicking her out it's hard, painful and takes lots of time, wasting life. You don't  have to be rude, though, learn how to treat her, listening her words and advising her are the best way to help her and yourself. Letting her stay and being rude will start  a war between both of you, a nasty one, and in the beginning, she is always stronger than us. \nTakes years to overpower her and acquire control.\n Listen the echoes inside of you, the voice around you and read the words dedicated to you. It may be someone nice trying to be nice with themselves or he/she could be someone struggling too, trying to make you know that there's others with their own wars, some of em had lost some battles, others had won, but all of em are fighting back, see them and learn from them. A few others have lost the will to fight and this lady took their heart, alongside their last breath. I never forget them, it could have been me.\nThere's stairs to heaven, highways to hell and the unlimited potential we all have to evolve, let me tell you my secret ;) :you seek outside the reasons, help, strength or anything you think you need to not give up. You NEED to go and look inside, think about  it. We are amazed by the wonders in the space, maybe because we already forget the beauty of the jewels in the deeps of the planet. That's the hint. \nI'm fool and forget to mention another possibility: if the written words were made for your eyes, the voices for your eyes, or the cheers for your heart, it could be a type of people I admire, respect and decided to become one of them in the future: The friends beyond all the fight. Because you'll find a friend in almost every one of them. And they will be one (or both) of two things: and adviser/helper, like masters, to share with you where they did stumble in their path and suggest useful things.\nOr your friends, doing the same as the first, and even more, much more.\nThey've learned to appreciate anything that shines in the darkness after living there for so long that they don't  want anybody to feel the same, and if you let me include myself with them, we will do such things because we like it, and we mean it. \nI am or I am not. Always. I'm always Too much of anything or absolutely nothing,  There's no mid points to me, I pour my soul in every thing I've decide to do, always help to anyone I can, serve the others and do good recklessly. That's one thing or two I believe in.\nSo, c'mon Bro, grab this hand I didn't had and take the strength I've lacked. Anytime you want, mate. That's why I'm here for.\"\n                                                                                                         The mind of Sun\n\nThat's a little thingy I wrote not so long ago, I've felt it would be nice posting it here,  it's  not the complete thing, it has some holes intentionally, but it's the first 80% of my own writings I've post ever. Hope it doesn't offend anyone, if it do not help you by any means, hopefully don't  hurt anyone either. I like to write, you know, my poison  of choice are poetry and philosophy  (damned poetry 😂),\nAnd if you catch even the tiniest bit of the deep meaning it also have, you already figured it wasn't a cute this half of my life. Lived in the bottom for years, pretended to be fine bc like we all do, I didn't want to worry not even one of my love ones, I was unable to have a treatment with a psychologist or psychoanalyst, and my whole list of sins didn't help much either.\nI've even tried to \"end\" myself  (sorry for this) four times.\nObviously, fortunately, unsuccessfully. \nAfter I've surpassed, the very first day after, for the first time in years, I've  woke up, happy. I don't  remembered the last time it happened. A couple of weeks after I've decided to believe in the things I've mentioned in my poor writing above, among others. And even more in those in the last two lines.\nI didn't had anybody to help me. Support me, freaking avoid I've tried those 4 things.\nI'm not fully recovered, I believe  this lady never really leave, it's always lurking but nice you won her, it's  more hard for her to regain full control. I've decided to always go beyond if I find myself a limit for anything, return anything good people do or give to me 10x  times better, if it was something bad, I'd return them something 100x better, don't  be cruel, don't lose yourself, do not treat people as bad as they are, treat them as good as you are.\n\nMany people here would probably know what cost me to learn these things too. \nThat's why I wanna help and give my full disposition when I've reply something similar.\nRegardless I do like to know all kinds people.\nAlthough I don't think of myself like a hero or anything.\nI'm trying to save pain to people that haven't reach that point, help the ones there, and for all the people struggling I'm  saying: I'm here for you, if you want. Just say the word.\nI don't start a chat, perhaps because I would be acting for my own selfishness at first glance.\nIt's  the way I respect people's desires. \nAlthough, I know how hard it is. \n\n\nTHAT'S IT, I'VE EXTENDED MYSELF QUITE MUCH.\nMY APOLOGIES HOMIES.\nI ASK YOU ALL TO FORGIVE MY GRAMMAR, I'M NOT A NATIVE ENG SPEAKER, LEARNED IT BY MYSELF, STILL POLISHING IT, I'M DOING MY BEST. \nTHE WRITING IT'S OBVIOUSLY PHRASES I'VE READ AND LIKED, MIXED WITH MY OWN THOUGHTS.\nI USE THESE QUOTE TO SYNTHESIZE MY OWN THOUGHTS/WRITINGS.\nI'm still a bit embarrassed for it.\nLet me quote a hero:\n\"Whenever you suffer pain, keep in mind that it’s nothing to be ashamed of and that it can’t degrade your guiding intelligence, nor keep it from acting rationally and for the common good\"\n\n\"My relationship to them. That we came into the world for the sake of one another.\"\n      MARCUS AURELIUS \n\nYou are more than you think, stronger than you feel, loved than you believe and unique than you perceive.\nSeek something you like or care about, make it a hobby. And do it relentlessly. \n\nThings like mindfulness, stoicism, a essay/book of a subject you like, even slightly interested in, are helpful too.  Learn more things, do more things.\nOnce you realize what's stopping you, bringing you down, you'll gain power over it and it will get weaker and weaker. \nYou are far more than you think.\nI believe that, soon you'll  do it too.\n\nRegardless the feedback you guys give me, I'm  here.  Keep that in mind.\nWhy not? ;)\n\nGood vibes homies ✌✌✌😎\nI send you all a Bro hug. \nYou can.\n\nEdit: I gave some format to this text, I'm on a mobile right now, you know Reddit don't care about formatting and stuff.\n2. I'm respecting the rule of no offering pm or smh, this was a last time. It could be helpful too, hard to measure and globalize something too random as the human being.

Both as someone who on other social media platforms have tried to help others and have tried to rely on people online to help through a tough time.\n\nThe crux of the issue I found is, you don’t know who you are helping. You don’t know them well enough to give that deep, personal, supportive advice they may be aching for.\nAs well as, being a counselor for free, though honorable, can weigh you down when dealing some people who have hours that don’t work for you or have heavier topics than you were planning and needing the help; especially if you don’t know the person well enough to know how being late, busy, or not being able to properly help an incredibly heavy topic is going to be perceived.\nAs was said, it also makes the receiver of the help very open to manipulation.\n\nMy own life has taught me that the best way to help people is to steer them towards counseling and genuine help that can be in their own life for them, or... if you feel the need to and the infinite patience, discipline, and love required, to genuinely change your life to help another person and be a part of their life.\n\nI’m not saying don’t help anyone unless you can do that; but setting boundaries and clearing up expectations are incredibly important with helping!\n\nBut as I said, you don’t know who you are helping and they don’t know you.\nAnd if you aren’t trained on how to protect yourself and the other person from that; sometimes helping people online can end up negatively for both parties.\nAccusations, things taken personal, personal issues, energy levels, reading a situation properly; hard to do if not impossible over text platforms.\n\nTo all the people who have helped me over the years when they could, under different profiles and such, thank you.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1579506181.0, "id": "ff2hcz9", "author": "IdealCanADate"}

If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule),  this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your intentions.  Neither is ever acceptable here in any form.  \n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. **Feelings that can be explained by person's circumstances are perfectly healthy no matter how painful they are. A depressive** ***disorder*** **only exists when someone's mood is out of synch with what's going on for them.** The \"what is depression\" wiki linked above has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but do NOT belong here.", "score": 11, "num_comments": 70, "created_utc": 1762296834.0, "id": "1oom3z4", "author": "SQLwitch", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1oom3z4/checkin_post_with_essential_information_about_our/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "depression", "text": "It sounds like you are going through alot right now. Its got to be hard to juggle your work and losing your dad. Do your coworkers know about your dad? They might be more empathetic if they did. But even if they don't care that still awful and im sorry you're going through that. Losing a family member is terrible. Im impressed with how hard you are working to keep everything together for your dad. Its alot of emotional labor to care for someone who's sick and yet you are still busting ass and working hard at your job. Your family is lucky to have you. I would be grateful for someone like you. I dont think it's selfish to get a new car. You need it for work im assuming and also you deserve to have nice things in your life especially with the monry you worked hard for. It might have been slightly irresponsible money wise at the time but not selfish. I got a new car too when I get my new job and it was definitely irresponsible. My apr was 15% and I had $1,000 payment. I understand feeling like you are drowning. That's alot of stress you're under. You sound like a really well educated and responsible person. Half the time I feel like a failure trying to understand insurance and keep up with all the bills. It feels impossible to be an adult and sometimes I just with my parents could still take care of me because damn this shit is hard. I think you're doing an amazing job for the situation you're in. \n\nAs for them saying you smell bad fuck them. If they didn't give you real advice on how to fix it then they're just being rude. However if you want some advice it's this: smells stick to fabric. Like your car or bed. Are you wearing an outfit twice or washing it before wearing it again? Always change your clothes every day if you can. Try to sleep in clean underwear and socks, or not go to work in the ones you slept in. If you have leather car seats, clean then with some lysol or clorox. If they are fabric you can spray them with lysol to kill bacteria and then spray them with a deoderizer to help them smell good going forward. Febr3eze has a fabric deoderizor that works great. Also wash your bedsheets at least once a week. Also sweat can soak into a mattress and then make you smell. When you wash your sheets, spray the mattress with lysol and then deoderizor and let it dry. If your shoes smell you can also spray the inside of them with lysol when you come home at night. They'll be dry by morning. Most smells are caused by bacteria. You can look into aluminum antiperspirant vs just deodorant. One covers bad smell the other actually helps stop you from sweating. You can try a different deodorant and see if that helps. If the smell is coming from something else like smoking or coffee then mouthwash and gum can help. I keep a small toothbrush in my car and just scrub my teeth and tongue then swish some water and spit it out once or twice a day so my breath isn't bad st work. If you are a heavier weight person and your skin sweats they also make whole body deodorant. \n\nThey were probably just being assholes but I hope some of this helps", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1763076130.0, "id": "nopv9p9", "author": "Other_Panda246"}

I live on a busy road, and lately I’ve become paranoid that my neighbours or people passing by must have noticed that I’m always home.

Not stronger, not lighter, just the same old me doing what I do (more like don’t do) when depressed. \n\nThe only thing that makes it “worse” is the disappointment in failing to emulate high me in a sustainable way when sober. When I’m sober and depressed, I will look around my messy room and not do anything, I will lay down with little feeling other than pain and exhaustion, even thinking is too much of a task. \n\nWhen I’m high, I look at my mess and think “damn haha how do I live like this, let me clean up” and actually do it. I will talk to my friends and family with a lot more openness, honesty, and care, even about my condition as my high self doesn’t feel the shame of depression, just logically understands why it may be seen as shameful and how to then educate about the realities of it to take the shame out of it and put the humanity back into it. \n\nI don’t smoke a lot when I do, I will roll a joint and that joint could last me a week (not even kidding). I will take two or three puffs and my high self kicks in “hey I don’t really need that much of this, I’m good as I am right now” then go on to do self-care tasks like brushing my teeth, showering, and drinking water that I’ve been putting off all day, as well as go on to manage some things that were being neglected in my space or life in general. \n\nIt gives me the freedom to think and be true to my values, and writing this is making me realise maybe that’s what I need to practice whilst sober, perhaps with a professional. As much as I want to have this state of being automatically with weed, I am aware of the downsides of weed long term and don’t really fancy trading my depression that doesn’t actually hurt anyone at the moment but me, for something like psychosis that can really hurt me and the people around me.

My boyfriend died in a car accident and shortly after the accident I found out about the pregnancy. I never got to tell him about it and it hurts but knowing there’s a piece of him inside me and that he’s not completely gone made it easier for me to get over his death. I don’t think that I will ever get over his death completely and I know that it’s going to be hard but I’m thankful for getting the chance to raise our baby even when he’s not really there. \nMy boyfriend was an only child and his mother was a single mom. The death of him really broke her. Since I told her about the pregnancy she’s been getting so attached and clingy. It doesn’t feel right to use that word for it because I know that she lost her son and I can’t imagine how hard it is for her. I’m a little concerned because she really thinks that my baby is a reincarnation of her son. She’s talking about my baby as if it was her son and she’s even using his name to address my baby. “…. Is growing so fast in there” \nI don’t mind her being close to me, I really enjoy her company and the support she gives me and I need it. I’m more than thankful for her support. But to be honest she scares me sometimes with her reincarnation thoughts and the things she says. Sometimes it feels like she’s possessed.

Anybody that says that tell them to kick rocks and take a long walk off a short pier. \n\nanybody that tells you losing a pet gets easier overtime they’re lying to you. It’s all about how you choose to look at the relationship that you have in the time you spent with your furry friend when I lost my beautiful Birman kitty of well I had her for 19 years but I got her when she was two or three so she was 21 or 22 when she passed, i’m so happy she passed in my arms. It was extremely difficult for me, but that’s the deal we make for the unconditional love they provide. I think this is the first time I ever dealt with something in extremely healthy way. I just had to honor her memory. I fostered a cat that was otherwise gonna be put down for about six months till she was healthy and able to be adopted. I did that in Mr. Kitty‘s memory. That helped me transition into finding the next companion. \n\nObviously, the physical aspect of their presence is the most difficult to deal with. You have to remind yourself that they’re not really gone. No one is they were part of your life for however many years in my case 19 I altered behavior patterns living situations life plans, goals I would not be who I am right now if she wasn’t part of my life for those 19 years, so she is embedded in my soul. She’s part of me and nobody can take that away. \n\nDepression is tough. It’s different for everybody and it hits different depending on the individual. there’s no end I’ll be all. my experience has taught me that laughter is probably better than any pill or other remedy. Watch a show that is always made you laugh for read a book does the same thing. It’s the most important thing is to always remember you are special and you are unique. There will never be another person like you and despite what anybody says or how anybody treat you but most importantly how you treat yourself you matter you deserve to be content and safe and you. And if somebody doesn’t like you for who you are, tell them to bugger off. I mean, I would rather be hated for who I am than light for who I’m not.\n\nI hope this helps.

I've already researched best spots to cut. I'm debating whether to go for my carotid artery or my radial artery. I'm a skinny man so it would be easy for me to cut it. everything is ready now. I'm ready, the blade is ready. should I do it? I have nothing to live for anyway. I'm just a burden to my family. I am a stepson and ever since I can remember I never felt part of the family. I am always told to keep quiet and stay in my room and  I'm also not allowed to talk to my half sibling. for anyone wondering why I still live with my family despite my age, I live in south east asia it's harder for us to just live on our own. besides that, I just lost a 3 year relationship last December and now she just told me she went out with someone yesterday and she felt calmness like nothing I gave her. she said it wasn't a date but they went to a beach and watched the sunset together.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "depression", "text": "You aren't worthless, you are just as valuable as me and as anyone else no MATTER what. You aren't a burden, you are a human being. Don't feel guilty of your failures and suffering - they are just as meaningful as the good stuff. They shaped you to become who you are. This world still needs you and your uniqueness in ways you might not be able to imagine yet, trust me.\n\nIt must be hard for you to go through not feeling loved in the family and being abandoned by someone you loved. I dont know who are these people, but I assure you that the hate they might have given you doesn't have to do as much with you as it does with themselves. It's just the way humans work, we can only spread so much negativity that sits in ourselves. For example, for your ex to deliberately mention to you that she went out with someone and felt calmness you never gave her, it seems that she as well suffers so much from your break up that she wants to forget about it trying to prove herself that she feels better now and this is her way of doing it. I dont say it to judge these people, I just want to say that you shouldn't take their own bad energy into yourself. Although it will be hard, it's worth it.\n\nI advise you not to commit suicide. Yes, life is always worth living despite any person and any situation out there, I promise you. But for you to understand that, you must find your own reason to live - this can also be called the meaning of your life. Friedrich Nietzsche said: \"He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how\". And believe me, it's true.\n\nOnce you find your reason to live (and it does exist and lurks around you, take my word for it), you will be able to become the one you are meant to be and live the life destined for you. You will be free of feeling unloved, because your love for the path in life you've chosen will outweigh any surrounding hate, free of feeling worthless, because you will realise your unique worth you've accepted, and free of feeling lost. And once you find your meaning, you will be infinitely glad that you decided to stay to pursue it, I promise.\n\nTo find the reason to live for may be hard, but it's worth it. It's always there. For now, have faith that you'll find it and let your search be the reason to stay today. But don't stop pursuing it until you succeed.\n\nI also recommend you to read the book \"man's search for meaning\" by Viktor Frankl. It's about finding this reason in whatever conditions imaginable. It might help you.\n\nAgain, you are still needed here in this world, with your experiences, your values, your beliefs, contributions and everything else that makes you your unique self.

My husband is an amazing person, I can open up to him about anything. But I got some secrets that if I open up with them everything crashes and burns, lives get ruined or no one believes me. I get ptsd flashbacks where its like im reliving moments and struggle to get back to reality. Im getting panic attacks. Im scared to leave the house. It makes me angry how people can hurt you, fuck you up for life and never have consequences for their actions. Im trying to heal, trust and be okay again but I dont know if its something I can do. Im a super bubbly person, I make jokes and whenever I try open up about shit face to face I just end up saying stupid shit. I cant tell people. I dont know. I feel like im failing as a parent. I want to be okay, I dont want my daughter seeing these ptsd episodes or panic attacks or depressive episodes. She is the cutest little girl, god shes perfect but im terrified of letting her out of my sight, I literally cant go out without her without breaking down. I have attachment issues and I dont want her to end up like me. I keep thinking if I was gone she would be better off but I cant do that to her either, I cant do it to my husband. My life is great right now but the past keeps eating me alive. How do you move on? What are emotional tactics that will help? How do you actually get help, like actually bring yourself to do it because everytime i try all that comes out is laughs. Im so unserious that its a problem. I write, I listen to music I avoid alot. But when it hits, it hits and I have a full blown melt down. Thank god my husband works alot and doesnt see it alot of the time, he deserves better than me. Thats not even a depression speaking thought. He is genuinely just that amazing. So why tf am I even complaining? It feels pathetic, I need to just get the fuck over my problems. Question is. How?¿ do i get a friend to talk to? I dont have friends bc im scared of leaving the damn house!!! I feel like im going crazy. I feel fucking crazy.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768039857.0, "id": "1q90j24", "author": "Candid-Phase2048", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q90j24/mom_guilt/"}

Here is what I learned about being alone.", "text": "I’m at a point, at age 30, where I’m looking back and realizing I didn’t do any of the things you’re \"supposed\" to do.\n\nI stopped making friends when I was 16. No long-term childhood friends, no college squad. I skipped the parties, the school events, and the milestones. I moved through school and college like a ghost—just showing up for exams, passing, and leaving. Now, my work is entirely solitary. There are no human connections in my day-to-day.\n\nBecause I’ve been alone so much, I don’t really follow societal norms. Sometimes I think I just don’t know them anymore. I’ve always been someone who values **depth and resonance** over numbers, so the \"small talk\" and \"networking\" side of life never clicked.\n\n**The Relationship Lesson** I had one relationship. They were narcissistic and took advantage of my \"niceness,\" which I now realize was just my neutral behavior—I overlooked red flags because I didn't have a baseline for what was \"normal.\" But through that, I learned the most important thing: **how to live without meaning.**\n\n**The Shift in Perspective** I used to feel the weight of \"wasting time,\" but I’ve come to a few conclusions:\n\n* **Life doesn’t have to make sense.** It doesn't need a grand narrative or a \"purpose\" to be valid. Sometimes, it’s enough just to *be* and to stop the constant cycle of overthinking.\n* **Success is temporary.** People chase \"success\" because the world appreciates it, but that appreciation is fleeting. It doesn’t last.\n* **The Final Room.** No matter how many friends you have or how high you climb, at the end of the day, you have to face who you are. It’s just you in the room with yourself.\n\nI’ve spent my life in that room. While it’s been lonely and \"unproductive\" by society’s standards, I have learned how to handle my own self.

It's been 11 years now living with a cloud that follows me everywhere.\n\nNo matter what I'm doing, who I am with, where, why, when. It doesn't matter. I haven't felt a spark of happiness in ages. I have actually literally forgotten what happiness feels like, it's like I never experienced it in the first place.\n\nI exercise 3 times a week, eat healthy, just 20 minutes on social media a day, go for a walk every other day, but nothing changes. I see people hanging out and laughing, and it all feels so far away from me. I thought a healthy lifestyle would help. Medication and therapy were useless, because not only is my depression chronic, but also treatment-resistant.\n\nI've gotten to the point where, even though I can function in society, I truly don't see the point anymore. Since I have persistent and not major depression, I can somewhat manage to do stuff, but it is always there, it never, ever leaves. I don't ever get a tiny second of happiness or relief. Believe me when I say the cloud is there from the moment my alarm goes off until I go to bed. Every second, minute, day, week.\n\nHow am I supposed to keep on living like this? Has anyone found an answer? In the last two years I watched maybe 2 movies. I used to love cinema, this illness took that away from me too.\n\nI do not see the point anymore, the only reason I'm still here is because I'm not struggling painfully, because I can leave my bed and get things done. I'll turn 40, 50, 60, 70 and will continue living like this, why would I want that for myself? I think about dea th and it feels so peaceful. I don't plan on doing anything, but the idea of not being here anymore feels so peaceful and calm.\n\nI don't think I can put into words what my life is like 24/7 if someone were to ask. If the point, despite any hardships, is to enjoy life, being happy or at peace, then why should I be here?

I know my problem isn't as hard as what others experience based on what ive read on this page,, but I just want to vent my feelings... A bit of background about myself: I’ve always been a good student at school, always on the honor roll, top-of-the-class stuff. Maybe because of this, the pressure to do better started to affect me. Lately, I’ve been feeling so down and exhausted.\n\nI’ve got work piled up (club proposals I need to do, homework I don’t want to do, and quizzes I have to study for), and I try to motivate myself to push through, but I just feel so tired. Life hasn’t been easy on us after all. My dad just lost his job and reapplied for a new one, but his salary is lower than it used to be, so my mom is also working to make ends meet.\n\nI feel so guilty that I’m not doing my best in school while my parents are doing their best to provide for me and my sister. I want to do better. i want to work hard so that in the future I can return back all their sacrifices.. I want to live a happy life where I won’t have to think about money or school, or whether I’ll be successful in the future or not. But I just feel so tired of everything, i dont want to move from my bed.. I hate everything. \n\nRecently at school, my teacher (notorious for her strictness) didn’t accept our research paper, just because we failed to print the three copies she required. We didn’t find this out until we submitted the paper, and by then it was already too late. Our school closes at 5 p.m., and we passed it at around 4 p.m.\n\nHer rule was simple: no research paper, no defense. Because of that, we won’t be able to present next week and will get a zero. Haha. If only I had done better and actually worked properly, we would’ve been able to submit the research. But my useless self... goddammit. \n\nNow she released the list of groups allowed to defend next week, and of course, our names weren’t there. Seeing it written down made everything feel more real... A zero. Just like that.\n\nI tried to laugh it off at first, pretending it didn’t matter, but it did. It really did. All I could think about was how one small mistake turned into something this big. I kept replaying everything in my head... what I should’ve done, what I could’ve fixed, how different things would be if I had just tried harder.\n\nEveryone keeps saying it’s “just one subject” or “just one requirement,” but it doesn’t feel that way. It feels like proof that I messed up, that I failed when I was supposed to do better. And the worst part is knowing that this could’ve been avoided… if I wasn’t so tired, so unmotivated, so done with everything. I just want to end it all... but im still so damn young and i have a life to live... and I keep thinking of the costs my family would have to spend just to bury my stupid body...

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "My story", "text": "My Story\nI was born the only son in a family with two older sisters. From a very young age, I was constantly compared to them—in school, in achievements, and in everything my parents could think of. I know I wasn’t as academically strong as they were. They were the kind of students who almost always got 100%. I wasn’t bad myself, though. In primary school, my grades were around 90–91%, and the lowest I ever got was 87%. But in my family, that was never enough.\nFor six straight years, I was compared to everyone—my sisters, my relatives, and especially my cousin who was my age. The words I heard as a child were too heavy for someone that young. They damaged me mentally.\nOnce, my father told me in front of everyone, “If you get 98% this year, I’ll buy you whatever you want.” Then he added, “But I’m sure you won’t.” Those words stayed with me.\nAll of this could have created hatred between me and my sisters, but thank God it didn’t. Even as a child, I learned to keep everything inside. I stayed alone in my room, holding everything in my heart, crying quietly so no one would hear me.\nWhen I reached preparatory school, I scored 95% and felt proud of myself. My sister was studying dentistry at university. She ranked third in her class. My father celebrated her success openly. When I told him my grade, expecting him to be happy for me too, he said, “What’s good about 95%? Someone who gets 100% is better.” He was talking about my cousin.\nThe comparisons never stopped. I just kept everything inside.\nThen came high school—the Egyptian public education system. I told my parents that I knew myself well and that this system wouldn’t work for me. I asked to join the American system because it had fewer subjects and suited me better. They refused, even though I kept insisting. The system was exhausting and mentally draining.\nOn results day, I overheard my mother talking to my aunt. My aunt said her son got 86% and was crying. My mother replied, “If he got 86%, then how much do you think my son will get?”\nI swear, those words felt like knives cutting through my body. I had a panic attack. Until today, my mother doesn’t know that I heard that conversation.\nI failed physics. After the retake exam, my total became around 55–56%. My father swore I would repeat the year, even though the system didn’t allow it. Later, he said he would transfer me to the American system—the same thing I had begged for from the beginning. I secretly retook the exam and passed, thank God.\nAt university, my dream was to study aviation. I truly wanted to become a pilot. My father refused and told me that even if I studied aviation, he wouldn’t help me find a job.\nMy friends were accepted into universities in Cairo like MUST, MSA, and BUE. I wanted to join them, but my father refused and forced me into a university in Sinai because my older cousin was studying there.\nThat was the first time I lived far away from my family—me in Sinai, them in Minya. From the moment I started university, depression hit me hard. I started to feel like I was nothing to my family, like a burden who didn’t deserve to live. I began having thoughts of self-harm.\nDuring my first year, a terrorist attack happened near the university city. Officers and a soldier were killed. The next day, my father called me and said he was ready to transfer me to any university I wanted. I went to him, but I told him no. I chose to transfer on my own terms.\nI became very isolated. In my first year, there were months when I spoke to only one person.\nLater, my family started asking me, “What’s wrong with you? Why do you look different?”\nBut I didn’t know how to answer.\nHow could I explain fourteen years of constant comparison?\nFourteen years of locking myself in my room and crying quietly?\nFourteen years without anyone asking me, “Why are you sad?”\nEven in small things, the comparisons followed me. My cousin had been going to the gym for six or seven years and had a great physique. I trained for a short time, gained weight, and people noticed.\nAt a family gathering, my father said, “Look at you, and look at your cousin—he’s been training for years.” Even progress was never enough.\nI went through periods of severe depression and reached very dark places. I survived those moments, but they left scars. What stopped me was thinking about my sisters, especially my eldest sister, who passed away in 2009. She was the closest person to my heart.\nFor years, I haven’t been able to sleep because of constant overthinking. I reached a point where I couldn’t sleep naturally anymore. Since my first year of university, I’ve depended on medical help to sleep, and now I’m in my fourth year.\nAt this stage of my life, I am under psychiatric care. I take prescribed medication, including sleeping medication and mood-stabilizing treatment. These medications don’t solve everything, but they help me function, sleep, and get through my days. I’m also seriously considering therapy, because I know real healing needs more than just pills.\nI love my family. I truly do. I try to get closer to them, but when I go home, I lock myself in my room. That’s what I learned to do to protect myself.\nMy sisters became doctors. I studied business. Since I was young, I’ve felt ashamed to ask my father for money, because I grew up believing I didn’t deserve to ask for anything.\nIn the end, I thank God that even as a child, my mindset was mature—almost like someone in his thirties. If it hadn’t been, all this pain could have turned into hatred between siblings.\nInstead, I carried it alone.\nAnd I’m still trying to heal.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768048747.0, "id": "1q931xd", "author": "Baraacomfortzone", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q931xd/my_story/"}

I was denied that because she “didn’t want her son to get addicted to cold medicine.” So everything, but his clothes, came from me out of my pocket I never complained. She repaid me by getting mad, because I didn’t want to change his clothes. She was trying to pick him up from me while we were at the park. She got upset took all of his stuff, and pretty much said she doesn’t need me. Mind you I did all of this from the good of my heart. I got into it with my child’s father none of my sisters helped me, instead they still were friendly, and spoke to him on a regular basis. They knew it was a toxic relationship, so much so that I ended up moving states to get away from him. If anyone calls me I’ll come.

Like life is just raw dogging  me. I feel like idk its my fault. I chose to move back home with my parents. And my room the total chaos and shame is right back infront of me. And when im supposed to be rebuilding my life. I can barley function in it. I started cleaning with a serious punch. But then it suddenly I just became overwhelming.  I just cant bring myself to it anymore. Life is so hard rn where I'm at. It brings back all the old horrible memories. I feel stupid af for making a rash decision to come back here to the place that doesn't even feel like home. But was my home for most of my life. I feel like most days I try to be strong. Everyone around me probably doesn't realize how deeply I'm struggling inside. My room feels like its my only safe space. But its not even my safe space anymore. Everyday I tell myself im going to clean more. Im going to take the trash bags down of the stuff I've already picked up. Tbh I could throw everything away in here and not really care except for a few things. But I just cant bring myself to it. Its like this mental block. I hate myself for being this way. Idk i feel very alone tonight and just sitting and looking at it all and wishing I could force my brain to function right. I think everyone gets tired of me. I think everyone will always leave me that I love or care about.

Some people recharge by being outside and constantly moving, and some people feel safer and calmer at home. Some guys are social, some are quiet, some are creative, some are steady, and none of that makes anyone less of a man. What hurts is the pressure — the idea that you have to perform a certain version of masculinity just to be accepted. That pressure wears people down.

I've lost my friends, and my freedom.", "text": "I am in my early to mid 20s, and the past month or so has been the most devastating time I've ever been through. I've had a pornographic addiction from a very young age, and it had got to a point where I did things that I am completely, utterly ashamed of. My ex found out and broke off all contact with me. She blocked me on all social and messaging platforms, and told me never to find her in real life, and that she thought that I was a disgusting person. Next thing I know, I was arrested. I am currently out on bail.\n\n  \nThe days after the incident, I was a walking zombie. I went to her house, hoping that she would be willing to see me, but she never did. I spent countless hours just roaming the streets. I didn't know what I was trying to achieve, but I guess I was trying to take my mind off the entire incident. It didn't really help. I tried to continue work, but my attention span has been close to 0. I spend 20-30 mins doing work, and the rest of the time I'm either lost in my thoughts, or wandering around.\n\nThe thing is, I poured my heart and soul into the relationship. I spent almost every waking moment with her, whether in real life, or in spirit. Perhaps I had dependency issues, but I truly loved her, and spending time with her made me really happy. But now that this is all gone, its like my heart had been ripped out of my chest. She took a part of me that I can never get back, and I feel so empty and lost.\n\nThe past month, I've been trying to get over her. I am going through therapy to help deal with my afflictions. I have also been diagnosed with clinical depression, and was prescribed antidepressants for the first time. I'm not sure how I feel about being labelled as depressed, but I think it doesn't help my mental state in the least.\n\nI've had dreams almost every night since the incident. Dreams of the good times that we had, dreams of the night that she cut me off, dreams that she forgave me and was willing to get back together with me. All these dreams only made things worse, and when I woke up, reality set in, and I was back in the depths of despair.\n\n  \nI think that both the emotional turmoil from the breakup, as well as the weight of my actions, have brought me to such a depressive state. I hate myself. I think that I am not deserving to be a human being. I think that I am the most vile scum known to mankind. Knowing that she doesn't care about me and hates me too also contributes to the pain.\n\nThe emotional pain had gotten so bad that I have considered ending my life. I do not have a concrete plan, but I have had thoughts of jumping off the building, particularly off her apartment floor. I have thought of overdosing on sleeping pills. I have thought of stabbing myself through the chest with a knife. I have thought of putting myself in front of a car. I have almost done the last one, but dodged the car at the last minute. The suicide squad came to my house one night, and apparently the person that tipped them off was my ex's friend. That fucked me up in the head more ngl.\n\nI am afraid to be alone. I've been meeting up with as many old friends as possible. Friends that, despite knowing that I've done horrible things, were still willing to listen to me, to see the good in me, and to help me through this ordeal. I am truly grateful for them, but they can't be with me 24/7. Once I am alone, I fall back into a mental fog, filled with thoughts of self-loathing, hate, regret, and longing. \n\nI know that being caught in this mental loop is useless. It doesn't help me in the slightest. But I think the prospect of the future being so bleak, and that I have lost everything in a single night, gives me little motivation to do anything productive right now. I wish to be able to sleep forever, and I've been trying to do so, but to no avail.\n\nNow the school term is starting, and I am extremely afraid of what is to come. I am alone, and with my mental state as such, I am afraid I might not be able to cope with school. Friends have suggested that I join new clubs and make new friends, but I don't know whether I can make friends with the depressed state that I am in.\n\nThat's all I can write for now. I might update on some stuff in the coming weeks about how it's going. But for now I'm just trying to survive day by day.\n\n", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768034379.0, "id": "1q8z2an", "author": "depressedDolph", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q8z2an/i_feel_like_ive_fcked_my_life_over_ive_lost_the/"}

I've posted about my upbringing previously and the abuse I suffered at the hands is my mother. My feelings are conflicted because I ended up with letters that she wrote as a teenager to my grandfather. \n\nMy grandparents sent her to a mental hospital when she was 12 until she was almost 18 where she ended up living with my great grandmother. And the abuse she suffered in that place was horrific. I couldn't even imagine. \n\nHowever, paying it forward wasn't the answer. I have thought about killing myself ever since I was a child and always chickened out. Then as I got married and had children I couldn't do it because I couldn't leave them.\n\nI think I realized that a few years ago when I had a mild heart attack. I'm not sure because I never went to the doctor, but I had all of the symptoms. I was telling my kids a year or two later and I looked at my son (mid 20s) and he had this look on his face like he was about the cry and had to stop himself. It broke my heart you see the devastation on his face. \n\nI became a completely different parent because of my upbringing. My mother never told me that she loved me. I have this joke I tell that I thought my name was Shithead until I was 10. I wish I was making that up, not that I really thought that, but that was because that's what I was called during my youth. \n\nI tell my kids and step kids that I love them all the time and even my step kids (I never use that title, they're my kids) hear it from me and they call me \"dad.\" I know I'm rambling. \n\nAnyway, I've tried counseling and have hated it every time I've gone. My wife tells me that I need to go. We had been married over 20 years before I told her even a portion of my childhood. \n\nI know I need counseling, but how do I get out of my own head I order to get help. I have tried two different psychologists, but maybe I'm a horrible patient. The funny thing is, I tell people every day that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But I have a hard time believing my own advice. \n\nI'm not sure if I made any sense, but any advice?

I didn’t find a therapist I clicked with until last year and moving away from home. She was the one that helped me realize I suffered from complex childhood trauma, unfortunately she felt too overinvested in my life and had to drop me. So, I would suggest just keep trying new therapists. I know how easy it is to say, and how hard it is to do. I also know how much time feels wasted after having to find a new one. I also understand how it feels to get very little out of therapy yet still go because it’s “better than nothing” I haven’t found my reason to live yet, but it feels like you may have. So it’s not getting “through” your feelings, so much as getting in touch with them, and you have to look for a therapist who can assist in that. It isn’t easy, it is annoying, and most of the time it doesn’t help the way you need it to. But continue trying, that’s the only thing I can think of. As terrible as it sounds, picture your son’s face in your head and use that awful feeling you felt as motivation to keep looking, in hopes you’ll never have to see that face again. You’re not a terrible patient, I’ve thought the same myself, you’ve just had therapists that weren’t designed for you.

My mom is even worse: everything I say, do, or don't do, every move, facial expression, or dress is an excuse to judge me, insult me, yell at me, and scream at me. My dad is still bearable for now, he doesn't say mean things to me too often, but my mom, on the contrary, does it at least 3 times a day. They don't let me go without anything financially, but they make me feel bad every single time I get a bad grade, every time I do something bad for them.

Three days ago I started school again after winter break. Needless to say, both the break and going back to school were traumatic. During the break, I kept getting yelled at for waking up late, for my parents saying I wasn't doing my homework, for trying to relax and take things slowly (but failing because of them). On the morning of the first day of school, I was woken up by my mother yelling at me to get off my ass (it was 6:00 AM, school starts at 8:00 AM).

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "14 Jahre – starke Angst ausgeschlossen zu werden, Grübeln hört nicht auf, obwohl objektiv „nichts Schlimmes passiert“", "text": "Hallo,\nich bin 14 Jahre alt und weiß gerade nicht mehr weiter. Ich schreibe hier, weil ich hoffe, dass Menschen, die Ähnliches erlebt haben oder sich auskennen, mir helfen können.\nKurz zu mir:\nIch habe Freunde, ich werde aktuell nicht massiv gemobbt und ich werde nicht komplett ausgeschlossen – und trotzdem geht es mir innerlich seit einiger Zeit sehr schlecht. Genau das macht es für mich selbst so schwer, weil ich mir ständig denke: „Warum geht es mir so, obwohl eigentlich nichts Schlimmes passiert?“\nVor etwa zwei Jahren hatte ich schon einmal eine depressive Phase. Damals war es in den Sommerferien besonders schlimm: Ich lag viel auf der Couch, hatte kaum Energie, habe mich zurückgezogen. Erst als die Schule wieder begonnen hat, wurde es langsam besser. Danach ging es mir längere Zeit gut.\nJetzt ist etwas Ähnliches zurückgekommen – aber anders und sehr beängstigend.\nDer Auslöser war, dass ich in einer Freundesgruppe (viel über Discord/Spielen) öfter kleinere Beleidigungen abbekommen habe. Wichtig dabei:\nDiese Beleidigungen gab es eigentlich schon immer, sie gehen nicht nur gegen mich, sondern auch gegen andere – manchmal mehr, manchmal weniger. Objektiv gesehen ist das in der Gruppe „normaler Umgang“.\nTrotzdem hat genau das bei mir etwas ausgelöst.\nSeitdem habe ich eine sehr starke Angst, ausgeschlossen zu werden. Selbst wenn aktuell nichts passiert, reagiert mein Körper sofort extrem.\nMeine Symptome:\nMorgens direkt nach dem Aufwachen starkes Grübeln\nGedanken wie: „Ich kann das nicht mehr“, „Was, wenn sie mich ausschließen?“, „Was, wenn sie sich ohne mich treffen?“\nStändiger Kloß im Hals, Übelkeit, kaum Hunger (oft kann ich zu Mittag nichts essen)\nErschöpfung, Kopfweh\nDas Gefühl, dass sich alles „falsch“ oder komisch anfühlt\nGedanken darüber, wie es wäre, nicht da zu sein – ich will mir nichts antun, aber der Gedanke macht mir Angst, weil mein Kopf sagt: „Dann gäbe es keine Probleme mehr.“\nIch kann schlafen, ich gehe in die Schule, ich treffe Leute – aber innerlich ist alles extrem anstrengend.\nEin klares Muster:\nMorgens ist es am schlimmsten\nÜber den Tag manchmal etwas besser\nAbends, wenn ich spiele oder mich treffe, wird es oft deutlich ruhiger\nAm nächsten Morgen beginnt alles wieder von vorne\nSoziale Situation:\nIch bin mit vielen Jungs grundsätzlich gut oder zumindest okay. Ich bin aber eher ruhig. In Gruppen habe ich fast immer das Gefühl, der Letzte zu sein – in einer 3er-Gruppe der 3., in einer 4er-Gruppe der 4.\nAndere sind laut, machen Blödsinn, beleidigen und werden dafür gemocht. Ich mache das nicht so, bin eher nett und im Hintergrund – und das fühlt sich manchmal wie ein Nachteil an.\nWenn jemand anderes fragt: „Kann ich mit?“, sagen die anderen meistens ja.\nWenn ich fragen will, habe ich starke Angst, dass ein Nein oder eine Beleidigung kommt – also frage ich oft gar nicht.\nObwohl aktuell objektiv nichts gegen mich läuft (keine neuen großen Beleidigungen, kein klarer Ausschluss), hört mein Kopf nicht auf, alles zu analysieren. Jede kleine Distanz fühlt sich sofort wie Ablehnung an.\nSchule &amp; Umfeld:\nFreunde aus Parallelklassen zu finden funktioniert bei uns praktisch nicht, weil die Leute dort sehr komisch sind und komplett andere Dynamiken haben.\nIch bin also stark auf meine Klasse und meine bestehende Gruppe angewiesen.\nHobbys:\nIch habe viele Hobbys im Umkreis ausprobiert (Sport, verschiedene Aktivitäten), aber ich konnte mich nie langfristig für eines begeistern. Dadurch habe ich dort auch keine stabilen Freundschaften aufgebaut. Das verstärkt das Gefühl, nur diese eine Gruppe zu haben.\nComputer / Spielen:\nIch spiele viel, nicht weil ich nur spielen will, sondern weil mein Kopf dann beschäftigt ist. Wenn ich nichts zu tun habe oder alleine zuhause bin, werden die Gedanken extrem stark. Von außen wirkt es dann so, als würde ich „nur zocken“, aber eigentlich ist es eine Art, mit der Angst klarzukommen.\nEssen:\nWenn die Angst stark ist, habe ich keinen Hunger oder mir ist übel. Das ist kein Trotz, sondern körperlich.\nWas mich zusätzlich belastet:\nDie Angst, dass das nie wieder ganz weggeht\nDie Angst vor einer neuen Schule und keinen neuen Freunden\nGedanken über Zukunft, Erwachsensein und Alleinsein\nDer Gedanke: „Einmal Depression – man erholt sich nie ganz“\nRational weiß ich:\nMan muss nicht überall dabei sein\nFreunde machen auch Dinge ohne einen\nKleine Beleidigungen sind nicht automatisch Ablehnung\nAber mein Körper glaubt das nicht. Er reagiert, als wäre ich ständig in Gefahr.", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1768025423.0, "id": "1q8wild", "author": "Intelligent_Rate_104", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q8wild/14_jahre_starke_angst_ausgeschlossen_zu_werden/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "depression", "text": "Putting this here because I just had to clean up a whole lot of dangerous misinformation in the comments.  \n\nThe only reasonable answer to \"What actually helps depression?\" is \"It's different for everybody\".  Depression is so varied that there's a lot of conversation in the clinical community about splitting it into several different disorders, plus individuals vary enormously in how they respond to treatments, support, and self-help techniques.  \n\nIt's never okay to say \"it never goes away\", because sometimes it does.  (It has for me, but I realize that's just one data point!)  However most of the people can be described as \"cured\" won't be found hanging out here.  It's also true that some people's experience is that the depression doesn't leave but needs to be managed throughout life.  That's not as good, obviously, but it's usually not terrible, either.   \n\nThe best tl;dr I can make is that at the current state of our knowledge, not everyone can be cured, but almost everyone can be significantly helped.  However, finding the best treatment(s) isn't always easy -- sometimes that's the hardest part of the whole recovery process.  \n\n&gt; ive honestly tried everything\n\nCould you be more specific about the treatments and your experience with them? \n\n&gt; im sixteen  \n\nAge *is* a factor here.  Your brain still has a lot of developing to do, and sixteen is an extremely tough age for a lot of people.  But if you've been depressed for 7 years there are probably some environmental/interpersonal factors at play (e.g. \" my mother being a drug addict and hiding it from me for the last five years\"), and those are things that will start to become less important and more manageable (including through making some people less present in your life) as you get older.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768019330.0, "id": "nyqdap8", "author": "SQLwitch"}

I deprived myself of smaller joys like setting aside money to buy a few coffees on my way to work or to eat out every now and then.

So when that sense of security collapsed, it felt like the final nail in the coffin.

My family has supported me financially, and while they don't fully understand what I'm going through, I don't feel harshly judged by them. Even so, my biggest fears feel as though they've come true, and I'm struggling with the sense that I'm not making any real progress.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "depression", "text": "Your depression sounds like it may be situational. At least in part. And it kind of sounds like your mum is struggling too, which while not an excuse might explain part of what's going on here.\n\nDo you have any family you can reach out to?\n\nWould you feel safe reaching out to something like Child Protective Services? Or if you're religious, somebody at your church? Any adult, really.\n\nWhy are you homeschooled? Is it possible to go to school or join some sort of club?\n\nOther that that, the things I'm about to recommend are very small but they may still be helpful. \n\nFirst, environment. There's not much you can control at your age but keeping your own space clean and uncluttered, having somewhere that is your sanctuary (in as much as it can be) is important. As is getting outside, if only for a walk or to sit in a park. Having something you have control over that isn't harmful to you is important, and sometimes that's a simple as making a choice between whether you scribble on a piece of paper with the red pen or the blue pen.\n\nSecond, creative outlet. You might not feel comfortable journalling but you can doddle, draw, colour, write stories, do crafts, etc. A way to get out your emotions and engage your brain in something \"productive\" can help stabalise your mood. Things like reading and gaming are also quite good for this. Having a less harmful way of releasing or dealing with emotions is important, and can also give you a focus. World building can be another fun one.\n\nThird, music / whitenoise. This helps create a space that feels more for you but can also be really rewarding/good for your brain. On a side tangent, I know that when I was severely depressed getting into kpop was something that really helped me. It was safe, gave me a focus, gave me something to look forward to. Finding something to invest yourself in like that can help produce a reason to stick around, even if it seems silly.\n\nBasically, you need to be able to unwind and let out emotions, and you need to create a hope for the future - even just a tiny one like a new anime dropping. It's not a fix, and it doesn't solve the root problem, but short term goals and survival are just as important as long term ones. In an ideal world you'd get the help you need. \n\nNext time you feel the urge to hurt yourself try scribbling on a piece of paper or running your hands under really cold water. Next time you feel the urge to kill yourself, give it a week. See if you still feel that immediate urge. Most people don't. Because, the truth is, suicide attempts that are impulsive are driven by deep pain/hurt, and those really extreme feelings tend to pass even if the rest of it doesn't. Most people don't really want to die, they just want to stop hurting. And that's not selfish.", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767965742.0, "id": "nyld9h5", "author": "Akagikin"}

I cannot just exist without feeling miserable. I don't even contact anyone from back home, I can't bring myself to for some reason, and when I get home, I just sit on my couch and try to distract myself with watching youtube videos.

I have been dealing with depression for a long time and lately its just keeps getting worse. I'm trying so hard to be okay and smile, but its so hard. \n\n\nThese past two months my family knows I have been depressed, crying almost every single day and trying so hard to work myself out of it. I thought I was doing good when I found a new job and moving out of my brothers apartment and live on my own. My brother was happy, but I could tell my parents were not happy, especially my mother. She was happy that I was going to be doing something in a hospital lab than a small clinic. But last night she started shouting at me saying how I'm going to be making a mistake leaving and there is no \"career\" growth for me there and that I need to get married (which she knows I don't want to at all), she continued on saying things about how I'm ruining everything all the time, bring things from the past, comparing me to others, and then brought something up I never thought she would, which hurt me so much.\n\n\nShe knows that I'm depressed as it is, but knew how this job was making me happy again, but she said all these things and she just crushed me. I went numb and couldn't even say anything. I have been trying so hard to get better but she always finds a way to crush me all the time. But she hurt me so much last night that I blanked and I cut my arms and legs pretty bad, I didn't even realize how bad it was.\n\n\nShe found me and rightfully said how stupid I am, why did I do, and all these things. Then started screaming at saying how I'm not her daughter anymore, not to call her my mother, while my brother is also screaming at me saying hes so disappointed with what I did, how I made my mother feel, I'm being selfish. I finally broke down and tried explain what's been going on, but each I tried to explain my brother shot me down and said \"I don't care, look what you did to her\".\n\nI feel a lone. I'm trying so hard to be happy, but I just end up screwing everything up. I'm so fucking tired of all this. Not a single person in my family asked me if I was okay or listen to me. I'm bandaged up now and been trying to be there for my mom now. I'm just trying to have her talk to me again and she won't. She won't eat and listen to me, but I'm doing my best she gets food so she can take her medicine. My brother told me before he left how, I deserve this treatment and I have to fix it. No one's talking me now and I'm just alone.\n\nI have tried opening up to my family and I'm physically crying for help, but it always ends up my mom being hurt more than me and we have to take care of her. Just leaving me back in the dark, and making her feel better. \n\nI feel selfish when I say, I want someone to hear me. I have no one to talk to when I'm hurt. I have no one listen to me. I have no one who cares. I'm just so alone and feel like I don't have a need anymore and somehow they would still blame me for everything when I die. I've been hurt so much and my family hasn't taken the second to see that I'm not okay. \n\nHonestly, I really don't know what I'm asking for. I'm just tired and I can't physically take it anymore...I'm just so fucking tired now and want to be happy for once. But I don't think I'll get it.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "My therapist SUCKS (rant)", "text": "tw: medical stupidity, maybe a bit of ableism??\n\nSo, basically had to get a new therapist after my old one quit. Met with new therapist (cannot be arsed to remember her name) like... three weeks ago, then went on vacation.\n\nAlready had bad vibes from her.\n\nThen today, had a (unexpected) expected appointment with her, because I was not notified whatsoever that I still even had the appointment, usually I get a text, which apparently they manually send out? Which, my old therapist would send it like three days in advance, new one sends it like an hour prior to the appointment, RAH!!\n\nSo, the entire reason I even went with current therapist, instead of the one my old one said I'd like, is because I wanted them to be the same date and time (Fridays 3 pm) and the one that my old therapist said I'd like only worked Monday through Thursday, so I went with this new bitch. You might think that's harsh of me, but let me explain.\n\nFirst appointment, it felt like she was controlling it. Which like yeah, I know they do that, but I just got the weird vibe like that, idk how to explain but it was almost like... a lecture? Yeah that's exactly the word I'm looking for, it's like she lectures me!\n\nSo for the first appointment, she went on about how she went to school and learned positive affirmations and how her other clients (WTF even *I* know you don't compare clients bruh!!) would do the positive affirmations every day for a week and come back in happier, like completely different people basically. Which uh... good for them? I... don't believe in positive affirmations. Like okay, I do a little, but not like, a magical cure all, y'know? Oh btw, I have major depressive disorder and am on meds, the therapy was just because I wanted a therapist. Also, my old therapist did NOT give me \"homework\"? Like seriously, first appointment was affirmations, journal, and I feel like there was something else I can't remember. I just... don't have the self esteem to look myself in the mirror and lie and say I'm beautiful (also also, I'm a transgender man. Nitpicky, I know, and men can be beautiful too, but she couldn't have said like handsome or something instead??).\n\nBesides the rambling, here's the main reason I'm making this post.\n\nSo just had the appointment today over the phone (thank goodness) and not zoom like usual, and she was blabbing on and on so badly that my grandpa who was IN THE OTHER ROOM could tell I was uncomfortable, despite not being able to hear what was being said.\n\nSo we talk for a bit, she goes \"everyone goes through a funk\" (barf, depression is not a funk bro), then asks me if I was doing the affirmations.\n\nI was like actually, no, I don't really believe that they work.\n\nShe goes, \"Have you tried them?\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah.\"\n\nHer: \"How long ago?\"\n\nMe: \"Uhh, idk... a year or two ago?\"\n\nHer: \"Oh, but did you really try to do them? I've never had anyone say they haven't worked, so you'd be the first, so did you like really put effort into doing them?\"\n\nMe: \"...Yes?\"\n\nHer: \"Oh, well I want you to do them anyway, just try it you'll see!\"\n\nI talked to my grandpa later and was all \"yeah I was pretty much I've tried them already, fuck you.\"\n\nHim: \"Did you actually tell her that?\"\n\nMe: \"Well no, not the fuck you part, but I told her I'd tried them already.\"\n\nHim: \"See, that's why she kept pushing it, she was trying to rile you up.\"\n\nAnd thinking about it... yeah, she had to have been.\n\nSee, at the end of the appointment (mind you, I imagine because I asked her, not that she was going to bring it up on her own), I asked her if she knew which therapist I was originally going to get after my old one quit. Also, she was like \"oh, she quit?\" like she didn't know, even though iirc she knew the last appointment that she quit, NOT that I had chosen to switch therapists like she apparently thought I had.\n\nAnyway, she told me she didn't know. I asked if she could find out, and she asked me if I wanted to switch therapists. I said yes. Then she reveals that she knew the whole time (possibly why she was being a bitch, although she was all up on the affirmations high horse at the first appointment too) and that her boss had told her I wanted to switch therapists.\n\nShe then says that there's no other therapist available, they're all full.\n\nAnd I was like, \"Really? Because the only reason I chose you, is because you had the time slot I wanted &gt;;)\"\n\nShe claimed she didn't know about that and she'd find out and tell me at the next appointment, and I was like nope nope nope, have your boss call me!!\n\nAlso at the end of the appointment, she asked me why I wanted to switch from her. I asked why. She said she wanted to see what went wrong so she could do better. I told her I wasn't comfy telling her, and she said okay.\n\nSo yeah. Fun times.\n\nAlso, forgot about this, but story from first appointment.\n\nShe claimed that she read the notes my old therapist left about me. But it was clear that she didn't and was lying.\n\nSo she asked me to explain my life history (kinda strange since that would be in the notes) because she wanted to hear it from me. Okay?\n\nSo she asks me about my family, and I say I live with my grandparents and my mom lives in the next town over.\n\nShe asks me about my dad.\n\nI was horrified, \"Surely the notes would've told you that much??\"\n\nShe had no clue what I was talking about. My dad *killed himself* before I was born. Why the fuck would you bring that up the first appointment, oh yeah, because you didn't read the damn notes!!\n\nPlus the fact that she (I forgot to say) asked me to repeat one of the affirmations aloud then when I reiterated AGAIN I don't believe in affirmations, she deadass goes, \"oh yeah, you were the one that didn't want to say the affirmations!\"", "score": 0, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768010918.0, "id": "1q8rlma", "author": "Particular_Camera571", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q8rlma/my_therapist_sucks_rant/"}

It made me very valuable. \n\nSo he came over and played the drums with me playing guitar for a little while and then we talked a little bit in my living room. At that moment, my mother came in crying because it was very very cold and Buffalo and I don’t know anything about cars, but I guess if your car doesn’t use antifreeze or doesn’t have any antifreeze, something called the block cracks and the car is no good anymore. \n\nso she comes crying because some mechanic is already told her that the card doesn’t work anymore and why it won’t work anymore, and that she’s got to buy a new one which she can’t. \n\nShe says, in a ferocious crying jag, tears in front of my friend and I “I don’t know what we’re gonna do for money.“ and I had never seen her so scared. I was about 15 or 16 at the time too. \n\nso my friend silently hands her a five dollar bill which is all he had on him (relative to me he had a pretty secure life).

We didn’t talk about it. I’m not sure what she did after that. We lived in the same house.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "I'm so scared of posting this", "text": "Hi I'm new to this community. I joined because, well, nothing else is working out and I don't have anyone to vent to but I need to just... Tell someone about it and maybe just saying it will motivate me to get better? Idk but anyway this is going to be long so I totally understand if this post just gets pushed to a corner.\n\nI'm almost 24(F), graduated university more than a year ago with a social science degree that most people call \"useless\" because most jobs in that field are given out through politics or whatever. Nobody told me that before I started this degree. Our teachers at University were also highly demotivating, talking about how we're all going to be either jobless or start a Masters in a different field. Despite that, I continued because I thought they were just trying to challenge us. Turns out, they were right. In the previous year, I have applied to so many places , I don't even remember where. I received not a single reply back. It's not that I don't have experience, I've done a few internships, graduated with a high GPA and I have good references from previous supervisors. I got offered 2 jobs, one was with a place that I knew wasn't ethical and another was a good place but the interviewer kept trying to convince me to do podcasts for them or become the face of their channel and that creeped me out (it's also NOT the kind of work I wanted to do). \n\nSo this post-university time has been super rough on me. It feels like I woke up a month ago from a long trance and actually looked at my life. And I realised I have nothing going on for me. Pursuing a MS (in my country at least) sounds like a waste of money because what if after I graduate I find out that degree will also not help me with jobs? Just to be clear, I don't think any degree is useless, just that in some countries, certain degree holders don't get opportunities. My classmates from uni are mostly doing unpaid or minimum-pay work, doing a Masters abroad or just sitting idle like me. There are a few exceptions working in really good places and I'm genuinely happy for them, but again, they're exceptions. \n\nI... have no talents. I have no sellable skills. I'm no longer bright after suffering from depression and anxiety. I took meds, didn't work. I'm living with my parents with no financial freedom, or freedom in general. My parents don't want me moving abroad alone for MS. I barely leave the house so my social life is also kinda dead. I have 3 friends and they're all busy with their lives and I just don't meet them anymore because i feel like when we do they get super concerned and iI don't want to dampen their lives too. I used to be good at arts. I used to paint, and draw and make all kinds of cool crafts but now I start a painting and just start crying randomly. There's a half done painting staring at me and I want to throw it away. It's also not good. My sleep schedule is messed up because I just feel so restless at night and just doomscroll or read something all night. I sleep well into the day, have 2 meals and then retire to my room to be alone. I'm suffering from fatty liver + pcos and my liver enzymes Haven been normal for 3 years now. I'm so tired of getting up every day and making food that's rich in proteins, low in fats, contains stuff that's good for pcos and liver, making teas twice a day, and eating like 7 supplements every day. \n\nEvery day is a struggle. When I'm alone at home while everyone is at work I constantly fight the urge to scream and cry. I have a boyfriend but I want to break up with him because he deserves so much better and I don't want to drag him down with me. \n\nI KNOW the only way to fix all this is by making an effort, doing things but I'm so tired of doing things and not getting results. I have no motivation and no energy and fight the urge to go 6 feet under every day. And nobody understands how hard it is for me. My distant family, at every event, comes to me and lectures me about how I'm wasting my life. How I'm so bright and intelligent and how I should be working or studying and doing a phd and so much more but I just CAN'T. And the fact that I can't makes me feel like an incompetent, completely useless person and I don't know what to do anymore.\n\nI'm so sorry this was so long and if you read through all that thank you, you're probably an angel in disguise and deserve a cookie 🍪", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767987415.0, "id": "1q8hz4v", "author": "Specialist-Use2218", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q8hz4v/im_so_scared_of_posting_this/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "I was good for a long time", "text": "I was…I was good for a long time (maybe over a year). Was managing well with 5 medications, receiving routine therapy, treatment, and have a good support system. I’m now down to 3 medications, because I felt safe enough to discontinue 2 of them, last one being last May 2025. But, with the state of the world, paired with a personal issue, I’ve found myself right back where I was when I started the “extra” meds. I have MDD (major depressive disorder) and PMDD, take Wellbutrin, Hydroxyzine, and the occasional THC gummies.\n\nAlso want to share, I’ve never been suicidal nor have I self-harmed and do not foresee that being an issue. I’m just right back to this overwhelming depression, crying and tearful, full of rage, slow moving, no appetite, no focus, disassociating, wanting to be completely alone, and so not want to talk to anyone. Sleep is ok at the moment.\n\nThe world news is, I think, what’s caused this massive downturn for me. Everything is so sad. Sure, I could choose not to read it. But I do read just enough to stay informed and I am barely on my phone as is. I have a great support system but have always been one to keep quiet and shut down, disengaging completely. Phone stays on Focus mode and I allow only certain notifications to come through.\n\nWhat bothers me the most, is that my creativity and artistic side are stagnant. I spend a lot of time coloring, drawing, writing and creating art in any way I can and I cannot focus enough to do that. House chores are slipping slightly which is also very unlike “me”. I’ve lost almost 20 pounds since May 2025 (due to coming off of one medication, also began meal prepping and exercising regularly, which I am not currently doing and believe this plays a big part however I cannot seem to get myself to that point at the moment). I’ve been canceling appointments, friend dates, and ignoring people altogether unfortunately and my productivity at work has declined significantly.\n\nNot looking for any specific advice or anything…just needed to write this down somewhere to get it out and if you feel like commenting, that’s nice :) Apologies if this does not belong here and if you’ve read all of this, I appreciate you.\n\nAdditionally, I am 40F, living in western USA, work from home, stable job and home life, no kids, 3 cats and 1 dog; I have ADHD (inattentive type, managed with CBT Wellbutrin and Adderral), MDD, PMDD, PTSD and GAD. Stopped taking birth control in May 2025 because I felt it was time to stop, had been on it since I was about 15 for cramps).

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "What is alone?", "text": "I’ve told some of the people I love most and hold closest to me that I’ve had these thoughts and feelings of loneliness since I was young. There’s a memory I have of being around 7-8 years old crying in my bed at night going down a list of everyone I know; mom, dad, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends, saying each of their names and how they don’t love me. I don’t repeat this memory to anyone as far as I can remember, but I have repeated it to different people throughout my life. There’s been so many moments of change and hopefulness, where my surroundings and the ones around me give me a new start. Yet everytime, it all comes crumbling down. The attention and affection I was promised didnt fade, it never started. It feels so selfish to word it like that. I’m 30 years old now with three kids, how could I expect attention and affection or support. Every so often it feels like I through a tantrum trying to get my loved ones to just. Do certain things or say certain things that need to be done or said. When ever I’ve begged and pleaded for what I’ve wanted to happen or be said in my life I’ve always made concessions to include or surround my wants and needs in such a way that it provides for someone else. I’ve been at such a low point in my life for so long. I wanted this miraculous change everyone says happens when you have kids. I bought a suit, I went to interviews, I researched online, I went to therapy, I did so many due diligence things to try to start building a foundation for my kids. Instead, I’m a stay at home dad. While I’m blessed to have a hard working partner to be the mother of my children, I’m blessed to have a step dad that’s helped provide a home next to his for my children, I’m blessed my partners sister stays with us providing the needed income. I’m blessed. And while I’m blessed, I feel stagnant. I’m treading water somewhere under the surface waiting for when I can peak my head up. When we have the money and time we will officially get married. When we have the money and time I can go to school. When we have the money and time. I can’t bring myself to do household chores like a normal person. We don’t wander through filth, my partner does a lot of cleaning, the kind you have to do with young children. I stay calm a lot of the time but sometimes I see my kids through my father’s eyes. The only massive shift I felt after having kids was how fast time flies by and how drastic every little mistake can feel. Every time I say no the hurt they feel is so dramatic and real for them. I have a whole life and list of things to be responsible for and yet I feel so selfish getting stuck blaming my past that lead me to be here with my kids. This weight on my chest of how much I want to do more with my life, to do something about the world and its problems, to help my family and friends and to help. I don’t know. Even now I’m hiding under the covers while getting my kids to nap. I feel so deflated, defeated, heavy. I also feel blessed, that feeling you get when you see something beautiful. Like a beautiful scenery in nature, or a beautiful scene of someone helping someone, or when you see someone achieve something they worked hard for. That love you feel when you hold your baby for the first time, or when you hold your baby and you’re remembering when you held them for the first time. I can feel all of that and this debilitating crushing weight all at once. So that’s, it, when I wonder what it feels like to feel alone. It’s like that. When you’re not alone, but you feel so segregated, from yourself and the ones and things you love. I superficially say I hate a lot of things, but this feeling, this loneliness, I hate this.

Im definitley not lazy but something about depression makes my enthusiam for something beyond my current degree of energy motivation makes me wonder would pushing that boundary help me or only make me more depressive\n\nMy ideal work is working alone as much as possible\n\nI was offered a job of drop offs between unmanned sub depos . Essentially id be alone all day in fact it was nights which was even better. But i missed the boat waiting on documentation .\n\nSo many jobs almost evrryone there seems to give a shit i mean its there lives.

Most days i couldnt be half arsed talking to colleagues either  the working enviroment can be a bizzare place of competitiveness and cliqueness, ive never been interested in that. When i start a job thats my job i have no desire to out work or play games to excel i work mostly on merit . \n\nThe eniroment in most jobs can be draining . \n\nTo me its just clock in clock out\n\nI think most people i meet think i dont want to be here in some capacity", "score": 2, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767969888.0, "id": "1q8a3g3", "author": "Logical-Sea-9545", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q8a3g3/imposter_syndrome/"}
{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "I think my brother is passing me his depression", "text": "Hi, I’m 18yo and my brother (21yo) is depressed. He’s always been lonely and never had many friends. During his high school years he was depessed and harming himself, but I was too young to understand. It’s been two years since he moved out to attend a music school. The first year was good, he made some friends and was happy about was he was learning. This year it’s been different. During the summer he started staying up all night and not doing anything during the day. During the family vacation, after fighting with my mother he cut himself in the bathroom and we all stayed with him and supported him. When he started the music school again, at first it was going okay. However, he started getting worse and couldn’t bear being alone. He wanted to call all day and have company. He said his friends were not good for him and started seeing them always less. He also started having thoughts about his future. He doesn’t know if he wants to continue with the music, or go to university. He’s insicure and this feeling makes him feel worse. My parents, my sister and I have been supporting him in any way possible, accepting all his ideas and encouraging him to start therapy. In november, on tinder, he met a guy who lived 100km from him. They started to see each other and kinda fell in love. We all thought he was good for him, but turned out he was just as depressed as him, even more and was only a bad influence. He started to be emotionally dependent and eveytime they would leave to go back to their own cities, my brother would be sad all day and would want to call all day long to have company. More than once they discussed over their relationship, as the guy wasn’t sure about it, and my brother’s anxiety grew and grew. Yesterday, they broke up. My sister left today, cause she goes to university in another country, and I don’t know what to do. \n\nMy brother doesn’t know if he wants to go back to his city and his music school, and my family and I are supporting him either way. He doesn’t sleep, and last night I stayed with him until 1 am. Today he started therapy and went okay, but it was the first session and they couldn’t talk about much. He says he has no one, that he’s alone, he doesn’t have anything in life that he can hang onto. \n\nBut i can’t not sleep, i can’t stay with him all day. I have exams i need to study for. And staying at home makes me feel sad, anxious, I lose my appetite and energy. Im scared of what he can do. I try to support him but I feel like he’s influencing me with his negative energies. I want to go out with my friends but at the same time I don’t wanna leave him home alone in his thoughts. I’m so sad for him. And I know that if he commits suicide,  my family would be broken forever. I’m so tired. But I can’t not do something.

You're probably going through a lot, you don't need to overwhelm yourself with heavy restriction and cruel weight loss content.

Im sorry that this world has failed us. please try to surround yourself with people who do love you and like you for who you are bc they ARE out there you just have to find them. even pretty people still have to find people who truly like them for them. try not to engage with media that puts down black women and tell yourself neutral not negative things about yourself to rewire your brain, it is possible. try to find black woman representation that does the same interests you do and its okay to vent, loving yourself wont happen overnight it takes time so be patient. sorry this is long but i hope this can help you. &lt;3", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1767955933.0, "id": "nykprmj", "author": "Mountain_World_644"}

I don't feel like anybody cares. I don't think anybody would notice if I was gone. If I didn't think I'd go to hell if I did believe in an after life or if I did believe in an after life at least I would probably kill myself in an instant. I feel so damn alone. I feel so misunderstood. By everybody. By myself. How the f*** is anybody supposed to understand me if even I don't understand myself. The only time I sometimes even feel sort of loved is when my animals are happy to see me. My parents are dead. I sort of have a family but I don't even feel like they care about me. And it's nothing they've done because they're truly amazing. I know it's my brain playing tricks, but it still feels real. I don't feel like it would negatively impact them if I were to die. I feel like everyone would be better off if I was just gone. I've been trying so damn hard to just enjoy something. To feel happy. Not to feel dread all the damn time. It feels like my entire life has just been going through a slow downfall and right now it feels like I'm at the end. It feels like nothing ever gets better. I can't even do a good job at work anymore. I'm good at nothing. I'm not driven. I'm not attractive. I'm not smart. I'm not good at talking to people. I'm not good at understanding people. The only thing I've even sort of proficient in is technology And even that I'm not that great at. I couldn't handle computer science in college and so I switched to an easy major. I just feel like I'm at a dead end of life. Everything sucks. And I am so alone. And nobody gives a f***. Not even my fiance. And I can't tell anybody this. Because if I do I'll just get locked up and my life will be even worse. And the last time I tried to tell my fiance she just called the police. I feel like I have to just sit here and pretend to be okay when I'm the furthest thing from it. I want to tell my family or somebody so bad. It just feels like nothing would change. There isnt getting help. I feel like I just have to keep putting up with it as long as I can and pray one day maybe just maybe I will feel happy for once. But I've been living in this hell my whole life and I'm in my 30s. When the f*** am I going to feel some relief? When the fuck do I get to be happy. When do I get to be with somebody who actually cares about me and makes me feel loved. I thought I finally found that somebody. But everything turned around and now I'm being abused. Physically and emotionally. I also can't leave because I can't afford to live by myself and living with family isn't really a realistic option. I really want to make this relationship work because it really was a dream come true for a while. I've tried so many things to make them see how they are to me, and they claim to want to change or want to listen to me or whatever. But they don't. But I'm just an ugly, fat, broke, loser who doesn't deserve any better. Because every relationship I get in eventually turns into this. So maybe I do deserve it. Maybe I deserve this hell I live. I certainly don't feel like I deserve any better. But how much longer am I going to be able to put up with this. How much longer am I going to be able to fight to survive. How much longer am I going to have the strength to not kill myself. Strength isnt the right word. Because I'm sure as hell not strong. I'm a fucking loser. A broken sad sack of a supposed man. I had to try to help save my dad unsuccessfully as a kid and then a few years later my mom died out of the blue. I was depressed even before then, but it feels like those two experiences have broken me completely. I run through the day my dad died all the time. I remember making dumb mistakes. I remember his eyes. I remember everyone telling me he was going to be okay, but I saw him. I felt him. I dragged his body. I saw the vomit spew out of his mouth as his eyes never wavered. I remember feeling like it had to be some nightmare I'd wake up from. I'm such a fucking loser and my parents would be so damn ashamed of me. I should just put myself out of my miserable existence. Maybe one day I'll find the strength to do it. Then maybe just maybe I'll finally have some relief. \nDrugs give me some relief. But for only so long. And I try so hard to not be on them. But it's the only time I even sorta feel happy anymore. I just want to be held and cry and feel like like someone actually cares. But at this point not even my fiance makes me feel comforted. I want so bad to feel understood. I want so bad to understand myself. I used to at least care about feeling clean but I can't even bring myself to shower everyday like I used to. I can't bring myself to clean the apartment as much as. I can't bring myself to do most anything these days. It feels like I'm just waiting for my life to fall apart enough to finally not care enough to finally kill myself. I wish so bad I could just be blissfally ignorant. It feels like I've tried everything and nothing will ever change. I know I sound pathetic. I know this sounds like phishing for compliments. But I just had to talk to someone. Even if it's into the internet void. Even if no one responds. Maybe just maybe posting this will make it that much more bearable to keep on fighting.

I need real help.", "text": "I’ve spent most of my life feeling like I exist slightly out of frame, like I’m watching the world through glass instead of living inside it. This isn’t a single bad moment — it’s the weight of many years adding up.\nI grew up without stable family support. From a very early age, I learned what it means to be moved through systems instead of held by people. I had food and shelter, but not the feeling of safety that comes from knowing someone is really there for you. When you grow up like that, independence isn’t a choice — it’s a necessity. You learn to rely on your mind because relying on people feels unreliable.\nI was always different. Social situations didn’t come naturally to me. Speaking felt hard; I would get stuck, lose words, feel exposed. While others formed friendships easily, I analyzed everything: how people talked, how they laughed, how they connected. I didn’t feel inferior — I felt misaligned. Like I was built for a slightly different world.\nWhat did make sense to me were ideas. Mathematics, logic, programming, electronics, AI, philosophy. I have a sharp, curious mind, and when I work with systems, patterns, and concepts, I feel alive and capable. Technology became more than an interest — it became a refuge. I dreamed of creating intelligent systems, robots, something that could help humanity and maybe give meaning to everything I’d endured. Not for money or status, but to change something for the better.\nI’ve always had a strong sense of justice. I hate discrimination, cruelty, and hypocrisy. I believe the world could be better, and that belief never left me — even when people disappointed me again and again. I don’t fit neatly into social or political boxes. I think for myself. Sometimes that makes me feel strong; other times it isolates me even more.\nOver the years, loneliness became constant. Not dramatic loneliness — the quiet kind. No one to message. No one to call. No one who really knows me or checks in. I kept telling myself I could handle it, that I was built to be resilient. And maybe I was. But resilience without rest turns into burnout. Strength without connection turns into emptiness.\nRecently, everything collapsed at once. I’ve spent days with no human contact at all. I can barely get out of bed. My body feels heavy and unresponsive, like it’s running on empty. I’m cold. I’m hungry. I’m exhausted beyond words. Even basic actions feel impossible, as if my system has shut down to protect itself.\nI tried asking for help. I reached out. I made calls. And when it felt like nothing worked, the sense of abandonment deepened. Not because I don’t want help — but because I feel lost inside the process of asking. Like I don’t know how to be helped anymore.\nI keep asking myself what the point of life is. Why I’m here. Not because I want to disappear, but because I can’t see a path forward from where I’m standing. The future I imagined — learning, building, creating — feels very far away when I can’t even meet my basic needs.\nI’m writing this because I don’t want to vanish quietly. I want someone to know that I existed, that I tried, that I carried a lot alone for a long time. I’m not looking for clichés or instant fixes. I’m looking for understanding, for human connection, for guidance on how to take the next step when you’re completely drained.\nIf you’ve ever been in a place where survival itself felt like work, and you found a way — any way — to move forward, please tell me what helped. Even the smallest thing.

I just wanting to say what is on my mind.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "26 y/o guy, tired of life", "text": "26 year old tow truck, honestly hate my life\n\nUsed ai to make all this btw, just too much shit to type\n\n26M Tow truck driver in Central Texas, feeling stuck and exhausted\n\nI’m 26, a Black man living in Central Texas, and I’ve been working as a tow truck driver for nearly two years. It’s kind of my first real job. I have a CDL, but I don’t use it — I don’t like driving big trucks. Towing has been a crazy experience: it’s stressful, sometimes dangerous, and every day is unpredictable. My boss is chill compared to other towing companies, but the pay isn’t great. I’ve saved about $11,000, but with low pay, it’s hard to see a clear path forward. I want to move somewhere else, get paid more, and finally have space to build my own life, but that’s easier said than done. Towing is the only job I’ve ever, sometimes I love it considering how spontaneous and fun it can be. I wanna possibly tow in a bigger area, had a driver from a bigger city tell me he makes 100k but idk\n\nI’m sitting in my truck outside the house now because I’d rather be here than in my house with my family. My family is toxic. My mom has severe mental health issues. Paranoid schizophrenic thats insufferable to  be around, I truthfully have nothing but hatred towards that woman. She even misused over $20,000 of my disability money. I had to take her to court to get a small portion back, and I’m still living with her because I can’t afford to leave yet. Took her to court late ‘24.\n\nI’ve been depressed my whole life and have had suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. Some days I wanna die — I just feel trapped in a life I never chose. I see other people my age moving out, building families, buying cars, and living their lives, and I’m stuck in the same town I grew up in, barely scraping by. Living with my damn parents, who’ve been arguing since I was a child. I hate that i’m related to them, wish I was adopted, better yet, never conceived would’ve been better.\n\nIt feels like happiness is something everyone else gets but not me. I dream about having my own place, hobbies, and freedom, but even those small things feel out of reach right now.\n\nI guess I just needed to say this somewhere. If anyone has ever felt like their life didn’t get a fair start — or like they’re stuck while everyone else moves ahead — how did you cope? How did you keep going? I just wanna be happy bro. I know everyone has shit goin on trust me, I work lots of car accidents and I know life can flip at any given moment, I know people in this sub have shit going on also, just wanted to get this off my chest. Idk if i’ll ever be happy. When I was towing a car on the side of the freeway recently , I contemplated just running into to traffic, just to end this shit. I just wanna be happy man.\n\nThanks for reading", "score": 1, "num_comments": 0, "created_utc": 1767978976.0, "id": "1q8e6e3", "author": "OccasionDesigner1877", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q8e6e3/26_yo_guy_tired_of_life/"}
{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "Finally done living. Best of luck!", "text": "\nYeah, so... i lowkey lost the war, if there even was a war in the first place. I always subconsciously knew this was supposed to happen, so it comes as no surprise; i never was supposed to live past 18, so i'd say this is long overdue. Thankfully, i had plenty of time to think of exactly \"how\" and \"where\"  i should die, so this decision wasn't an irrational teary-eyed tantrum, moreso a calm, calculated and liberating move.\n\nI can't exactly say i WANT to; however, i know i MUST. There's simply no point for me to continue forward, and definitely no point to try and find that point. I have COMPLETELY lost the plot. Even if i continue battling my, admittedly, rather shitty live circumstances (90% of which are entirely my own fault), even if i come clean on multiple daunting lies after years upon years of masking and no one from my social circle knowing or giving a shit, even if i somehow regain all my shitty friends who couldn't even try and reach out despite me calling for help in multiple different ways, i could NEVER get over the vile hatred and repulsion i feel for myself.\n\nI had all the calls to become something great. To, y'know, MATTER even on a scale of some crappy book i might write, or some painting i might draw, or even some great memory i might make with my friends. However, over the course of my entire childhood i continued to slowly lobotomize myself, with great help of my wonderful parents and undiagnosed ADHD, into what i am now. As a result, i have trouble calling myself a human. I look wrong, i move wrong, i breathe wrong. Everything i do is unnatural and ugly, as if i'm already dead and just being puppeteered around on [[silly stings!!!]]. I have completely lost an ability to feel INTEREST to anything i enjoyed to do all those years ago. I am living a half-life™ (haha get it, like, the game!) of distractions and fantasies. It's books and games and dreams and games and DON'T I FUCKING DARE focus on reality for a split second. 90% of what i think about doesn't even exist. I've been living on delusion sauce, i've completely wasted my life, AND I'M NOT EVEN FUCKING TWENTY. \n\nI have no talents, and if i did, they are buried and atrophied. I have no friends, and if i did, they couldn't really exercise the energy to understand me. I have no crush, and if i did, she would never love me back. Like, for what? I am unworthy of love, of friendship, fuck – recently i realized i can't reliably answer the question \"am i deserving of life\". I said, \"idunno\", which basically means i already know the answer. This is fucking sad, but even more than it's sad it's TELLING.\n\nMy physical condition is also declining. I can't focus on anything, my head hurts often, my movements are even more sluggish and slurred than they already are, and i've been sleeping for 10+ hours daily. Maybe i actually have, idk, a biiiig brain tumor. Would be fitting. I won't know, because the contents of my cranium are about to be spread out on wet asphalt like smooth, smooth jelly on some delicious peanut butter. (Woooow, i got jooooookes.). The only thing i know is that i'm fucking tired. From everything, all the time. I can't move on like this, and i am not obligated to the world to continue. In fact, the world would suffer almost nothing from losing an ugly, retаrdеd maggot. \n\nIn my note to my family members i advised them to forget about me as soon as possible. I can't advise the same to you, because none of you even know me. This is a testament to how little i actually brought to this world. The whole point of this post is for me to leave *something*, for someone, even if they don't give a fuck, to know that i was a little more than what usually meets the eye. That's more than i could ever possibly want at this point. \n\nI'm moving on. Don't repeat my mistakes, yada yada, and best of luck. ❤\n", "score": 145, "num_comments": 34, "created_utc": 1767881148.0, "id": "1q7cnll", "author": "metathesiophobic", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q7cnll/finally_done_living_best_of_luck/"}

As the title says, I (22F) am still struggling a lot of years after mom (39F) 's suicide.\n\nLong story short, mum died in 2017 and I'm still fucked up. The past year has been especially bad - I feel like ending myself approximately every 3 days, sometimes even more often.\n\nAfter she died, I became super close to other relatives, we talked about her, they helped me feel like myself again... And they're gone too. And I feel it's been a downwards spiral since then.\n\nWithout trying to boost my ego, I'm pretty successful in my field (primarly arts and NGO stuff). I've received several awards as well as worked with some pretty influential people in my country. Friends, as well as strangers, have called me an \"inspiration\", \"a role model\", \"super creative\", etc. I've had many people tell me they want to be like me, to be \"as brave\", \"as creative\", \"as ambitious\" etc as I am. \n\nYet here I am, wanting to off myself so fucking frequently. I smoke like a chimney, binge eat every day and can sometimes get myself blackout drunk just to feel better for a short while. I know I'd pretty easily get addicted to other substances if I have the chance.\n\nI once joked with a super close friend that my ultimate goal In life is to outlive my mum. I don't think it'll happen. I feel like, not only time doesn't heal, but every year it just makes shit 10 times worse. \n\nI've heard all the stuff - volunteer, workout, talk with friends, do art, etc, etc, etc. I do all of that. It doesn't make anything better. I can't celebrate my achievements, I don't feel good enough like... ever. I mean, I wasn't good enough for my mum to stay. I have amazing friends, one of which has also been through a ton of shit and we often talk about it yet I try to control my abandonment issues and not show them how attached to them I am and how much I dread the time when we separate and I'm alone with myself and my thoughts again.\n\nAnd I know all the other stuff, I've heard it all as well by many well-meaning friends and relatives - it's not my fault, my mum has struggled with it for a long time, including, by more religious relatives, that \"God gives his toughest challenges to his strongest warriors\" or whatever the saying is. \n\nI've achieved a lot of my dreams. It feels great the first few days, week, etc and then I just crash and this emptiness returns. I've told myself all the inspirational stuff - to get up, to never give up, that life could end at any second and I should fight, achieve my dreams, etc... so what? At the end of the day, I'll just feel the same fucking way again. \n\nI've been doing all the productive stuff, as well as the self-destructive stuff. I feel the self-destructive stuff so far has been much more numbing but at the end of the day, I feel like the only thing that will help will be to find a time machine, tell my mum I know she's suicidal, do my best to help her, tell my grandma to quit smoking before she develops COPD, tell my uncle to quit drinking and smoking before he gets cancer, tell my other grandma to get tested as her cancer that has been in remission for 30+ years will come back, etc, etc. \n\nThanks for listening to my rant!

I’m just exhausted, and I’ve barely gone to school this week and my parents are concerned about me rather than totally mad at me and I love them so much but I know that they’re disappointed in me because their daughter who was consistently an honours student and used to be so happy is severely depressed and frankly isn’t doing so well in school right now.

I don’t know what I did to deserve this because I’ve always been so good, I just hate feeling this way anymore and I’m just so tired. I texted a suicide hotline the other day but I was too afraid to really admit I was actually considering taking my life because I didn’t want the cops to come to my house or something.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "I got put on a PIP at work and I’ve been so depressed. How do I get out of bed in the morning?", "text": "Tldr; My boss is making my work life hell and has put me on a weaponised PIP. The work situation is really impacting my mental health. Do you have any tips for finding joy during a work day at a job where you feel undervalued and your boss is trying to get you fired? \n\nMy manager threw a surprise PIP (performance improvement plan) my way a week before Christmas. He hasn’t given me any hint I’m underperforming all year. But one day I think I unknowingly peed him off and two weeks later suddenly I’m the worst most underperforming employee ever. And now I’m on a three month PIP, which if I fail, I might (probably will) be fired. \n\nEver since this happened, my self-esteem has been on the floor. I dread going to bed because then I have to work the next day. I dread opening my laptop. My body is giving me all signs of ‘I’m uncomfortable!’. And I am so mentally drained. I know some of the things on this PIP are based on fiction too, which is even more frustrating. Because I bruised a little man’s ego (by trying to improve something he’d been doing before I came along), now my livelihood is at risk and I’m the problem. \n\nI’m so mentally drained that I called in sick twice, but I’m dreading Monday because I can’t keep calling in sick! Already he’s trying to make my life difficult by telling me I need to fill out a form to request sick leave when everyone I speak to never does it nor have I ever heard of this process before. \n\nI have to have 1-1s with the guy, and everything in my body is screaming NO THANK YOU. I feel like he has twisted so many things to make me out to be worse than I am that I just don’t have any respect for the guy. We’re in this situation because he can’t handle working with a woman who challenges the status quo - that is simply all. If I hadn’t have challenged him, I doubt I’d be on a PIP now. But at the same time, in my opinion, I was doing my job by challenging what I did…and if you’re curious I’m a copywriter and it was about grammar! He’d been spelling something wrong for the longest time when he was a copywriter, and then I just said ‘this is incorrect, here’s why, and here’s how our company would benefit if we change it. I guess he really liked how he spelled the word before :/. After the meeting where I made my suggestion and he disagreed (very rudely), I added his way of doing it in our style guide. So it’s not like I heard him say no and did it my way anyway.\n\nAlas he still managed to find some reasons to put me down and justify a bad end of year review and a PIP. Except he’s twisting his words from my summer review to make it look like he told me back then that I need to improve. Which is just lies; that review was good and I was never told I need to improve anything. So I feel totally gaslit.\n\nAnyway, it’s a complicated situation, you really had to be there. But now I’m on a PIP and I am just so down. I’m normally so bubbly, energetic, etc. But, as a high achiever type person, to be told everything I do is wrong is just so demotivating. I think the most f\\*cked up thing is that this isn’t even what I want to do, but because I have given a whole year - 40 hrs a week - to this job, it just feels like a real slap in the face to be told my contribution isn’t even valued. \n\nI really want to work for myself where no egotistical boss can tell me what I’m worth. But logistically I don’t know if I live somewhere my business idea would go well. It might, but it’s a risk. Normally I’m a risk taker person, so I’m ashamed that I’m using this excuse as to why I’m just not doing the damn thing! \n\nSo I feel kind of stuck. I am really uncomfortable where I work now because of how my boss has treated me, but I also need money so I can’t just quit tomorrow. I know the sensible thing to do is just to do my best and get whatever money I can out of this job and search for another one. But I’m so burnt out from corporate work; I just do not want to do it anymore. But I don’t feel like I have a choice because corporate is where the money is where I live. \n\nAnd so I write this from my bed because I just feel so depressed, overwhelmed, drained, peed off, all the negative emotions. I feel like I have a dark cloud following me everywhere I go. I can’t relax because I have this PIP to worry about. I can’t relax because eek I have to have a 1-1 with my boss tomorrow. A lot of feelings like this. \n\nCan anyone relate to my situation at all? How did you get through being dragged through the mud at work? Any tips for boosting my mental health during this stressful time? 🫠 I’m also in the middle of moving apartments with my boyfriend, so I just feel like I have a lot going on at the moment with no mental energy to do it.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "Brother with Depression/Mental Health issues", "text": "To start off, my older brother has been dealing with depression for about 8 years. Over the last 3 days, he’s started having what seem like manic episodes. He’s been addicted to weed for a long time, and I’m pretty sure he uses it to cope with his depression. He also struggles with insomnia and overuses his Dexedrine.\n\nGrowing up, he was genuinely one of the smartest people everyone knew. Everyone thought he was going to do big things. Fast forward 8 years and he’s broke, depressed, isolated, and hasn’t really accomplished what people expected of him. On top of that, he’s received a lot of nonstop criticism and judgment from people over the years, including family.\n\nThe last 3 days have been very different. He’s been extremely energetic, more social than he’s been in years, and keeps telling our family—who mostly look down on him at this point—that he’s going to prove everyone wrong and finally do something with his life. This is the most he’s interacted with us in 8 years.\n\nHe opened up to me during this time, and I tried my best to be supportive and not put him down, even though I could tell something was off and that the pills were likely influencing his behavior. When he tried to talk to my parents, they took it the wrong way. From their perspective, they’ve heard these same promises for years, but this time his energy and intensity were very different, which made them uncomfortable.\n\nEven though I supported him outwardly, I had the same concerns internally. I kept telling myself this was his mental health acting up.\n\nAs a family, we genuinely want to help him and get him back on his feet. We’ve tried ignoring the talk, encouraging him kindly, and being more direct about where he actually is in life. I personally tried being blunt because I believed honesty from family doesn’t mean lack of love. It actually pushed him to start looking into university courses and opening up more—until these manic episodes started.\n\nNow he seems completely out of it. He’s made comments like he’d rather overdose than kill himself because “killing yourself is what losers do,” which really scared me.\n\nI’m 20 years old and doing relatively well in my own life. I’m working toward bigger goals and trying to build a better future for my family, especially to help my hardworking immigrant parents retire one day. But this situation has started to seriously affect me. I’m constantly stressed, emotionally drained, and feel like I’m carrying responsibility that I’m not equipped to handle. It’s hard to focus on my own growth when I’m worried about whether my brother is okay or if things could suddenly get worse.\n\nI don’t know where the line is between supporting him, being honest with him, and enabling unhealthy behavior. I want to be there for him, but I’m also starting to feel the toll it’s taking on my own mental health and life direction. I was even told to get ahold of his doctor by someone to make sure he gets off the medication for dexadrine as that’s possibly why he may be having these manic episodes and for it being the reason it’s taking a toll on his mental health.\n\nIf anyone has been through something similar or has advice on how to handle this the best way possible please let me know.\n\nI’m not sure where exactly to post this or if this is the right subreddit.

I talk to myself a lot, i can hold conversations..but with myself. i pretend im okay with being completely alone, which honestly i think i am. I think its the part of not feeling like i could be loved, like something is wrong with me. And then that sends me right back to being reserved.

They blocked me, cut me off completely, and some of them continued to mock and bully me long after the relationship ended. Even now, it hasn’t fully stopped.\n\nI fought my way back.

I feel like I have nothing going for me and nothing to look forward to. There is no version of the future that feels hopeful anymore.\n\nI cannot remember the last time I was genuinely happy. Years have passed without stability, without safety, without anything solid to stand on. And when I finally thought I had found some sense of balance, it was taken away from me again.

Since all plans have seemed to fail me. I’m scare of myself losing the dwindling hope I have left.\n\nQuick synopsis of my life:\n\nI 18 and am a heavily closeted crippled severely clincaly depressed trans girl who lives in a very conservative small town. I love my parents and younger brother. My mom is a manipulative narcissist obsessed with having control of my life. She also on multiple occasions has molested me and abused me. My father is a coward who lost all personality when he got married. He does everything that my mother tells him to and he is usually the one to get physical with me. Finally my brother is a golden child who can do no meaningful wrong in the eyes of my parents. A spoiled brat that has found every way to torture and attack me. He was the child my parents always wanted and has a tendency to use this overt favoring against me. He also has a history of trying to sexually violate me and of nearly killing me on multiple occasions. \n\nAll together my home life can be considered a living hell. Currently I’m stuck in this hell and uncertain on how to escape without ruining my life.\n\nWhy I’m stuck;\n\nI have no way even with a job to afford my medical treatment, food, shelter, and anything else. \n\nThat means no future, no college, no dreams, no goal just survival or death\n\nMy parents want any kind of control they can on me. So they’ll do anything to keep me in their grip.\n\nMy evidence of my parents' abuse is or could be illegal. Context required: I was informed that my state is a two party recording state. Which could mean all my evidence of my parents abusing me is invalid. \n\nThe only hope is exemption for abuse and evidence of a crime.\n\nThere's still a small part of me that places value on my parents. Also my trauma makes me scared of them. Terrified of disappointing or failing them. With all they have done to me I'm terrified of them.\n\nEvery time I’ve tried to get outside people involved like the police it never goes well. \n\nContext: I made a report to the local police years back. They just went to my house, talked to my parents and left. Never looked at evidence or asked me about it.

There’s a lot more trauma and ptsd there but I’ll leave it at that for now.

I started talking to more friends, I started to be more open with my emotions as well as my sexuality, I became atheist after coming to terms with a lot of past events and trauma from their church, I painted my nails partially to help me not chew on them but also because I wanted to take more pride in my appearance, and I’ve been trying to separate myself from people who I feel make my life harder.\n\nMy parents don’t like any of it. Since I was a kid they never liked me having friends outside of their church. They don’t like that I’m atheist but say I’m an adult and that only god can “touch my heart”. They don’t like me painting my nails or wearing colorful clothes because they don’t want to draw “unwanted” attention or because it “sends a bad message to the rest of the church.

They said I can’t date, flirt, text, or hook up with any men while I live with them. \n\nSince I’ve came back I feel nothing but hostility, a hatred or maybe a tension so thick you’d need a sledgehammer to break it.

Acetylsalicylic acid has no antidote,so it could not be reversed .   I would prefer this method but I would not want to burden a physician with my death.  I am not sure which way to go.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "depression", "title": "From GAD to depression. Am I getting worse or am I getting better?", "text": "Hey All,\n\n39M here. I need some advice. I dont know if where I am at means I am getting better or worse.\n\nFor the past 15 or so years I have been dealing with debilitating anxiety. My psychiatrist at the time told me it was a form of neurosis stemming from depression, and I was diagnosed with OCD and put on Escitalopram for 4 years.\n\nI had debilitating anxiety and phobias with obsessive ruminations and all that. Finding the Escitalopram to be not great, I swapped to Clomipramine, which literally turned my days upside down. I became happy, stable, active, and for the next 8 years I built a family and all was good.\n\nFelt brave and tried to taper off. Life became really hard, low mood and high anxiety, phobias, everything feeling overwhelming etc. Tried CBT but with little success, resumed the meds and life returned to being wonderful.\n\nThen we found out that the meds had a very bad effect on my liver, I developed steatohepatitis and had to suspend the therapy again. Life returned to being quite difficult. But liver started healing. This was January 2025.\n\nAfter 4 months, I had a major anxiety breakdown following a family emergency, ended up in the ER, where I was put on Prozac and Seroquel to also manage sleep. Liver levels went back to being out of whack.\n\nAlso was diagnosed with GAD, a generally perfectionist and rigid character and not OCD.\n\nContinued with psychotherapy and psychiatrist advised I could try and come off meds again, noting that we needed to tackle the liver side of things. I came off everything in September 2025. Needless to say, since then it has been really hard, with either experiencing crippling anxiety or, at some points, really deep despair and sadness.\n\nAs I made progress with psychotherapy, in the past 2 weeks I have barely experienced anxiety. My drops now are really deep sadness, I feel like I am a bad father, a malfuncioning adult and partner, and everything is overwhelming. I am not even that worried about my perfectionist fixations (root of my anxiety) or anything like that all that much.\n\nI just feel down. Small criticisms make me spiral into feeling unloved, that my relationship is over, or my children telling me they love me makes me cry, the idea of travelling back home to Italy in March to see my parents and take the kids to Disneyland fills me with dread. I cannot focus at work and I feel like I haven't been happy/not felt like crap but a handful of times in the past 12 months. When I reach some sort of balance, it is very fragile and can be compromised by very little (bad night sleep, stress at work, weather, illness, etc.).\n\nSome of this stuff was there already when the anxiety was present. So if before was a general feeling of exhaustion + anxiety, now is mostly a feeling of complete exhaustion of energy and will to keep going. Everything feels too much. Anxiety used to keep me awake due to racing thoughts. Last night was the first time sadness kept me awake because I was feeling too shit to even sleep.\n\nAnd for the first time I thought about ending it (not making plans btw or wanting to go through with it, the thought of my children keeps me here), feeling that life is too hard and I am too exhausted.\n\nI don't know if the fact that the anxiety is gone, after being so much part of my life for so long, is a good sign that I am making progress, or that this is a further step into what has felt like a constant decline/daily struggle since January 2025. Meaning: I do not have the basic brain functioning left to even feel anxious.\n\nMeds wise, my only psychiatrist-prescribed option now is Vortioxetine, which I have a prescription for and am considering starting. But I don't know if this is a temporary storm I just need to go through and things will get better as I make progress with therapy.\n\nThank you everyone for your advice and support.", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1767930407.0, "id": "1q7xpt8", "author": "kr4mn1c", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q7xpt8/from_gad_to_depression_am_i_getting_worse_or_am_i/"}

No one will know. They’ll just stop looking. Just like I did. That’s okay\n\nI’ve been up and down my whole life and I did go on meds and that helped and then I went off meds and that was even better. I ended a relationship in 2015 because being in it nearly killed me. It was an open relationship until I realized I was an asshole and she was trying to get away from me. I didn’t want to face my issues so agreed to it. As she fucked around I drank and drank and got so so depressed. It was just such a familiar feeling.\n\nSomeone told me to go back to school, I did, got a scholarship and everything and moved cities. I aced it and drank my way through and was pitifully unhappy but content with moments of overwhelming intense emotional clarity. I quit school and blamed them for it being to easy (lol), drank myself homeless and moved back home burning every bridge. I had several good jobs too. Fired myself once they found out that I was a drunk depressed fool, lying to myself that the world had it in for me.\n\nI forgot to mention before I went back to school an eccentric millionaire gave me 50k. That’s right. I was a barista, we talked about money. I made a joke about flipping cars, being a sarcastic joke about it being a “good way” to make money. He thought I was serious, next week I was in a bank, he opened me an account and put 50k in. I shit you not. I just owed him half what I made! Like fuck me, when I think back… that was it! I could have done anything! But no! I went back to school, flipped maybe 10 and slowly he just realized I wasn’t going anywhere and started taking it back but by bit. Fuck. \n\nAnyways, so I’m back in my home town and I go to detox. My dad supports me a bit, I get some jobs, lose them. Get back into drinking. Live with a friend rent free as they lose themselves to an addiction. I finally get it together enough to find a place and I get an okay job with tips. I’m living alone, drinking, existing, I have friends, a best friend and I’m okay. I remember just saying to myself, “no girlfriends, just hook ups, no extravagant goals, just drink yourself alone till death, read, watch your documentaries, write your songs, do your shitty half drunk half assed everything, don’t disappoint anyone or yourself, the world sucks”.\n\nAnd that worked! I was content. I hooked up, I existed. And it allowed me to be fun actually. Like I made friends at bars, kept my close friends at a distance yea but still had old friends. Lots of mostly online interactions with them. I had my first seizure from withdrawal. I woke up in my basement apartment, my face and hair stuck to the floor in dried blood. My shoulder was broken. I kept it up. Chalked it up to, shits getting real, here we go.\n\nHere’s the shit of it, I meet her. Yes HER. Or I re-meet her. This is good. I super like her on tinder, it’s a super like match. She’s way out of my league. I make a joke and say, ‘this is a mistake yada yada’ and she responds, “you remember me right?”\n😳WTF right!?\nAnyways so turns out she was dating my buddy who visited from out of town when I was in open shitty relationship, they stayed with us in his van out front our house. Didn’t remember at all!\nAny who, so she just wants a friend while she’s working in town. We meet up. My heart stopped. I hadn’t believed in anything good in life, in me, AT ALL - I didn’t believe in love. I fucking shit you not, I saw her from 50 metres away - I forgot my name. I was done. I said to myself “oh no”. We fall into it. Dated for the summer, then long distance, then married.\nBut I’m fucked. I can’t stop drinking. I start feeling isolated. I changed jobs and I start making money and I’m spending it on her and she on me but we are saving. I am sustainably happy with a higher ceiling than my basement drunk content. I start losing my old friends, whatever, I love my wife but I start to think maybe kind of not. I realize a lot of my past I assumed she’d be okay with but I come to the realization she would definitely not be when one day she asks “do you know what a spit roast is!? Have you ever?” … \nAnyways, one of my old friends had really tried to be friends with me and her… really tried. But she had done some hard living too and my wife just kind of looked down on her. She had been having a tough go and I wasn’t there for her, I prioritized my wife and drinking. One night she came into my bar at closing and I promise her Monday we will hang out. She says “yeah let’s do that”. I wake up 2 days later and her family is calling me. She killed herself that night. I was the last person she came to see. I’m pretty fucked and my wife is understanding. I kinda block it out and tell myself she made up her own mind… in reality I feel so fucking guilty I abandoned her and my wife won’t ever really know me like she did. Slowly my wife kinda starts to tell me I wasn’t even a friend to her and she was disgustingly because she did drugs.\nAnyways, time goes on. I get a notice from the government saying I owe them 20k. I’m still figuring that out… I keep drinking. Wife slowly alienates me further. She hates my friends and she doesn’t want to make many friends. She had moved here to be with me. So I kinda lost all my friends. And so I drank like fucking crazy. I turned into classic drunk. I stopped showing up to work, I had two more seizures, I hid booze everywhere. My liver was going. I tried tapering but I got into some bad trouble. Here’s the hairy part and I swear, I understand how abusive it is to be an alcoholic to a wife but never ever ever did I cross that physical abuse line.\n\nOne night I was sober, she was wasted. I met her at her ONE friends house to take her home basically. I’m an asshole again now and just want to be drunk. She’s messing around being annoying on the walk home, I’m annoyed and want to get home so I can drink. She falls on the sidewalk and breaks her ankle. I run home and get the car and come back to her on the sidewalk. I’m trying to pick her up and get her in the car and drop her. I get her in and make it home. She calls the cops on me and says I broke her ankle. After so long she tells them she did it and they leave. She tells me though she only did that to save me but from now on I’m an abuser. This, she tells everyone. I drink and drink feeling trapped and ruined and just fucking awful but I can’t get out of this. She’s all I have left so I just start doing whatever she says, and agreeing to whatever she says. “Yes, I broke your ankle, I’m scum I’m sorry” I didn’t. One night we get into a fight she throws a knife at me. Cops come. I should have told them off but I was an idiot. I didn’t know what to do. The worst part was the cops got accidentally called when we were struggling over my phone! Just held the side buttons down. Total accident. So anyways they arrest her. I yell take me take me! No don’t! It’s fine! They say no and take her.\nSHES FUCKED! She’s very delicate, she doesn’t even know what a spit roast is! IM FUCKED! \n\nShe spent the night in jail and sobered up and sure enough she’s out with fucking a vengeance like she’s been in for 20yrs on a parking ticket and I’m the rat. I get her a lawyer. I go to my mother’s (that’s another story). Oh yeah, I’ve been on disability so no money now. Savings gone. So now I am an abuser who broke her ankle and according to her I called the police on her and made up a knife story and had her arrested to win a fight after I had choked her and beat her into submission before the cops arrived 🤔. She tells this to EVERYONE.\nI went on a bender. What do I do? I love this woman but it’s terrible. She’s coming home cuz her friend cant deal with her, she’s having an episode, restraining order is in place, I’m running out of time. Oh yeah she adopted 5 cats that I have to get back to a shelter, one ferrel. I was dead to myself already! The hospital had me hooked up to so much shit. My blood was 95 something. 100, your dead.\nSo off to rehab. Sure, saved me. 120 days.\n\nAnyways I sober up for good. She says she’s leaving me. The entire time I was away she needed me to call her every day at 5. She made me answer the phone by saying “hello, I’m sorry I broke your ankle and had you arrested for no reason” before she would speak. I comply. The stories change and I just started saying yes. I start agreeing and apologizing for shit that never happened. I can prove it with phone records and texts, pictures, video. My friends answered the phone a couple times. My family tried and that was nice of them but we are just not the same people.\n\nBut you have to remember, or I have to learn, everyday again and again that “I am a drunk abusive loser and I have no friends and they never really like me anyways and I should kill myself” And she’s right, or at least not wrong.\nI’m sober. But I have no money now, I pay rent. But I’ve only been out 3 weeks. Things were pretty good, but today she had a bad day and took it out on me. I just listen and agree with her. Say yes and I’m sorry, you’re right and she just gets more and more angry.\nShe just now got drunk, said she’s leaving me, screamed all the insults, yanked the dog away from me as it tried to follow me to the couch (away from her) and slams the door shaking the place.\n\nI know this relationships over. I don’t want to go back. I don’t want to go forward. I know I could put in the work really embrace my new sobriety which I do like, and see what happens. But I just don’t care! I didn’t care before her, I gave it a shot, and it ended back here. I am convinced I love her still which is fucked but if she could really get blood from this stone that’s gotta mean she’s like Stevie nicks and John prine in one. Fuck I just realized I left out so much more from the last 10 years, the other 30 are a real gas too… maybe if I live.\n\nIm saying, In life you need to have Faith in the tools your given that they will produce objective “good”. And if you don’t have that, you need to have Hope. Folks, I HAVE NO HOPE. I am no longer willing to look for it or recognize it if it comes to me. I’ve proven I can’t be trusted with happiness or opportunity.\n\n(That’s a lie, I love my dog more than anything)\n\nAs I say, Good luck everyone. I have one more day with my dog and I’ll cry up until she gets home and kicks me out. \nI have a car and a tank of gas. I live close to the Rockies, I know the spot to drive off the edge.

Ever since then, I've just been in this big depressive episode that I can't get out of. So many things have been happening in my life, and I'm just tired. It's just one thing after another, there's no break. I have no life whatsoever (I'm F20) no friends, nothing. My cat was my best friend, and I lost her.\nI saw one of those sad videos, where it showed a person with their animal in 2025, then it cuts to the person being alone in 2026, where it's the first year without them. I'm full on crying right now as I write this. \nI'm just so tired of everything thats going on in my life. It sounds so dramatic, it's been months, I should be fine, but when you have no life whatsoever, losing anything just hits so hard, especially a pet you grew up with.\nI miss her so much. I miss her greetings, I miss how she knew when something was off, and would jump on my lap to cuddle.\nI'm dealing with this by myself. I haven't told anyone how I feel. I don't feel comfortable crying around anyone but myself.", "score": 3, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1767919723.0, "id": "1q7tozs", "author": "All_I_Do_Is_Upgrade", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1q7tozs/loss_of_a_pet/"}

I realised that nobody had made this project before, and so I thought “oh, maybe this is an opportunity for me”, and so I started drawing backgrounds for it, and I actually felt like I had a reason to wake up every day. But then, BUT THEN, after having spent 5 days drawing various backgrounds, I find on my fyp that someone has made THE \\*EXACT\\* SAME VIDEO I WAS TRYING TO MAKE, ONLY BETTER.\n\n  \nReally stings to be honest. For once in my life, I though I could do something original, something I’d enjoy doing, but nooOoo00ooo, I cant have nice things can I? The fact I spent so much time and energy that I don’t have into trying to make something that was personal, just for someone to make the exact same video and post it a few days after I started making mine just.. hurts..\n\n  \nAll of that effort feel like it’s for nothing. I don’t want to quit, because I‘m proud of what I’ve done. But their version is so much better than anything I could do, and the timing of it all? People wouldn’t see the effort I put into it, and would only think that I copied them and am extremely unoriginal, because the internet is a mean place.\n\n  \nI just.. I don’t know. For once in my life I actually felt like I had something to work for, gave my life some sort of purpose, but apparently not.
