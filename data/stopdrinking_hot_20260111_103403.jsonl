{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "The Daily Check-In for Saturday, January 10th: Just for today, I am NOT drinking!", "text": "*We may be anonymous strangers on the internet, but we have one thing in common. We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n\\---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.**  Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink.* It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:**  A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n\\---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n\\- US - Night/Early Morning\n\n\\- Europe - Morning\n\n\\- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n\\---\n\nGood Morning and Happy Saturday!\n\nLet’s talk Self Care.  \n\nFor me, sleep is my number one form of self care.  When I’m well rested - most everything else is better.  I never realized how sleep deprived I was when I was drinking.  Even staying up late now can remind me of a hangover and ain’t nobody got time for that.  I do apologize for all the early posts for the check in this week, but I go to sleep early! ☺️\n\nPhysical activity is a form of self care that I lean into as well.  My dog especially likes it because we take a lot of walks.  Remember - rest is also self care!  You don’t need to earn it and you don’t need permission.  I hope you’re doing something this weekend that makes yourself feel cared for.\n\nWhat’s your favorite form of self care?\n\nAre you doing anything special this weekend you’d like to share?\n\nThank you so much for allowing me to be your host this week!  I hope 2026 is an amazing year for all of us!\n\n**IWNDWYT**", "score": 630, "num_comments": 1228, "created_utc": 1768021222.0, "id": "1q8v6sb", "author": "LetItKindle", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8v6sb/the_daily_checkin_for_saturday_january_10th_just/"}

Sometimes I just need to stop. Not sleep, not meditate, just be. I feel like it just helps my brain process life so much better if I make time to do that at least once a week, but more if possible.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "Day 17 checking in\nMy favorite form of self care is almost verbatim what was listed here lol\n\nSleep is HUGE!  I knew I was always tired but I didn’t realize that I DON’T actually have an internal alarm clock that wakes me up at 0400, “ready” to start the day.  Turns out, my body was starting to sober up and woke me up to demand more alcohol.  After only 2 1/2 weeks, I go to bed and fall asleep on my own and sleep (mostly) through the night for a solid 7-9 hours.  It’s a whole ‘nother level!\nPhysical activity:  I lied to myself and said I was prioritizing my family by procrastinating on “me” things (yoga, a quiet cup of coffee, a walk) by saying “well, I need to make them breakfast, I need to pack lunches, I can have a quick seltzer so I feel normal and can be on top of things for them” until I suddenly was out of time for me.  Turns out, I am far less stressed/anxious and my fuse is 10x longer simply because I take an hour for myself in the mornings before everyone wakes up to check in here with a hot coffee while everyone is asleep and do 30 minutes of yoga before starting anything else.  The dog is happier with less anxious energy too because we’re doing twice daily walks (short AM one long PM one).  I realized that my “selflessness” was instead just selfishness and hiding my addiction.  Let me tell you, that was a humbling moment.\nReading:  I LOVE reading.  Physical books, specifically.  I had forgotten how it feels to have a book in my hand and turn the actual pages.  I’m enjoying it again.\n\nThis weekend, hubby’s BFF’s girlfriend told me this week that she wants to get into a sober activity with me and wants to start working towards not drinking as much/stretching more so she is coming over tomorrow morning to do her first yoga session with me and we are going to go for a walk after up to town to grab a coffee or tea at a local coffee shop.  Then brunch with friends at the bar where I work.  I’m excited for shrimp and grits and a virgin Bloody Mary (the mix we have at work is the best and I don’t even miss the vodka).

I went to a lovely meeting last night, and tried to find another, but it seems that the second meeting no longer exists (last updated on the website in 2024, I showed up and there definitely was Not an AA meeting there). Too tired by 11:30 to get back out of bed lol.\n\nI woke my ass up this morning and forced myself into going to a 9:30 meeting (early for a Saturday!). I was certainly the youngest there, but it was a pretty fun and lively crowd. Lots of laughter. Some of us went to breakfast/brunch afterwards, and although my bank account is in the negative and I have to ration the $150 cash I have for the next two weeks (it was LITERALLY payday yesterday, but I've been on medical leave), I got some food and chatted with everyone. It was lovely. I feel lighter.\n\nDay 10/11 is where most of my relapses have occurred historically, so I'm on high alert right now. I'll be back on high alert near the end of the month, as it's the anniversary of my stepsister's death--she died, 8 days before her 23rd birthday back in 2023. It's grief I have yet to address. \n\nIn terms of self-care, I really haven't done much of that in the past few years. I've been living to work and drink. My home had fallen into disarray, I'd regularly go weeks without washing my hair or brushing my teeth, etc. I'm building those habits back up now, and I'm tackling one room at a time for deep cleaning. \n\nI'm almost done tossing all the empty wine bottles scattered around my apartment (there must've been hundreds), and I think I'll tackle my recycling and fridge next.\n\nAnd of course, my newest form of self-care is going to meetings! Right now, I'm aiming for one or more a day. I figure if I was drinking multiple times every day, then I've got time to hit a meeting too, right?\n\nI'm also meeting up with someone to discuss sponsorship on Monday, before a meeting she'll be the secretary at.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "Day 17 checking in\nMy favorite form of self care is almost verbatim what was listed here lol\n\nSleep is HUGE!  I knew I was always tired but I didn’t realize that I DON’T actually have an internal alarm clock that wakes me up at 0400, “ready” to start the day.  Turns out, my body was starting to sober up and woke me up to demand more alcohol.  After only 2 1/2 weeks, I go to bed and fall asleep on my own and sleep (mostly) through the night for a solid 7-9 hours.  It’s a whole ‘nother level!\nPhysical activity:  I lied to myself and said I was prioritizing my family by procrastinating on “me” things (yoga, a quiet cup of coffee, a walk) by saying “well, I need to make them breakfast, I need to pack lunches, I can have a quick seltzer so I feel normal and can be on top of things for them” until I suddenly was out of time for me.  Turns out, I am far less stressed/anxious and my fuse is 10x longer simply because I take an hour for myself in the mornings before everyone wakes up to check in here with a hot coffee while everyone is asleep and do 30 minutes of yoga before starting anything else.  The dog is happier with less anxious energy too because we’re doing twice daily walks (short AM one long PM one).  I realized that my “selflessness” was instead just selfishness and hiding my addiction.  Let me tell you, that was a humbling moment.\nReading:  I LOVE reading.  Physical books, specifically.  I had forgotten how it feels to have a book in my hand and turn the actual pages.  I’m enjoying it again.\n\nThis weekend, hubby’s BFF’s girlfriend told me this week that she wants to get into a sober activity with me and wants to start working towards not drinking as much/stretching more so she is coming over tomorrow morning to do her first yoga session with me and we are going to go for a walk after up to town to grab a coffee or tea at a local coffee shop.  Then brunch with friends at the bar where I work.  I’m excited for shrimp and grits and a virgin Bloody Mary (the mix we have at work is the best and I don’t even miss the vodka).  If shots are ordered, I will be having pickle juice.\n\nI feel inspired today.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "Straw Poll Saturday for January 10, 2026", "text": "Hello, fellow Sobernauts!\n\n\n[Last week](https://www.reddit.com/user/soberingthought/comments/1q2mhdd/straw_poll_saturday_for_january_3_2026/) we had exactly 1 vote and practically 0 voters for the 46th Straw Poll Saturday, down, like, 100% from 18 [the previous week](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pwncb5/na_beer_bracket_round_2_for_december_27_2025/).\n\n## Round 3 Recap: THE GHOST TOWN ROUND\n\n**Friends, we need to talk.**\n\nAfter a strong start with 38 voters in Round 1 and 18 voters in Round 2, Round 3 was a complete ghost town. How ghostly? Let me paint you a picture:\n\n- **Athletic Run Wild IPA vs Guinness 0**: 1-0. ONE VOTE. A single solitary soul showed up to cast a ballot for Run Wild, and Guinness 0 - the Irish stout that DEMOLISHED Athletic Free Wave 18-9 last round - received exactly ZERO votes. The marquee matchup we were all hyped for was decided by a coin flip disguised as democracy.\n\n- **Athletic Upside Dawn vs Sierra Nevada Trail Pass**: 0-0. Nobody. Not a single person. The bracket system presumably flipped a coin (Upside Dawn advances).\n\n- **Lagunitas IPNA vs BrewDog Punk AF**: 0-0. Tumbleweeds. Absolute silence. (Lagunitas advances by... existing first alphabetically? Bracket magic? Who knows.)\n\n- **Brooklyn Special Effects vs Deschutes Black Butte Porter**: 0-0. The dark beer showdown that could have been legendary... decided by the void. (Brooklyn advances.)\n\nSo after all that Round 1 and Round 2 drama, the Elite Eight was essentially auto-assigned. The bracket marches on, but the people have spoken by not speaking at all.\n\n## Semi-Finals Preview: AN ALL-ATHLETIC SHOWDOWN?!\n\nDespite the voter drought, the bracket has delivered something remarkable: **ATHLETIC BREWING VS ATHLETIC BREWING** in the first semi-final! **Run Wild IPA faces Upside Dawn Golden** - the flagship hop bomb against the crushable golden ale. It's sibling rivalry at its finest, and one Athletic beer WILL fall.\n\nThe other semi-final is **Lagunitas IPNA vs Brooklyn Special Effects IPA** - two American craft IPAs battling for a spot in the finals. West Coast hop philosophy meets East Coast brewing pride.\n\n**Can we get some actual votes this round?** I'm not asking for much. Just... more than one. Please. The beers deserve better.\n\n**[Vote in the Semi-Finals!](https://www.polltab.com/bracket-poll/xTlOSNtMHcutB)**\n\nIWNDWYT, and may the best brew win (with actual human votes this time)!", "score": 8, "num_comments": 22, "created_utc": 1767974897.0, "id": "1q8capk", "author": "soberingthought", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8capk/straw_poll_saturday_for_january_10_2026/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "You’re amazing for realizing this and doing it so young. What a beautiful life you have ahead of you. I’m so jealous!!\nFirst time I tried to quit I was 29 or 30. Back then there was one option, and no way in hell was I going to tell a bunch of strangers I was an alcoholic. Hell no! So I tried on my own. Made it exactly zero days.\nToday I am 64, which is so incredibly strange. They ain’t lying when they say life is short. Today I am also planning to stop drinking — again!!! I’m choosing Monday because by then the booze will be gone and my husband will be back from a road trip.\nThey also aren’t lying when they say alcoholism is a progressive disease. I’m worse now than I’ve ever been.\nMind you, I’ve quit a bunch of times before. For pregnancy, of course, but also because I’ve been successful at sobriety. Needless to say, relapse sucks. I want this to be the last time I quit. I want many sober years before I die. Mostly, I don’t want to die. If I keep this up, I will.\nI’m not yet ill from drinking, as far as I know. And I’d very much like to feel joy again before I die. There is no joy in drinking.\nSo kudos to you. Guard your sobriety with everything you’ve got! It’s ok for you to be selfish when it comes to self care. It’s ok to tell people who threaten your sobriety to fuck off.\nNever think working on yourself is a waste of time.

She was adamant on taking my bottom bunk and I was forced to sleep on a top bunk which I have a very hard time getting in and out of because of my lower back pain. It was a dirty disgusting old mattress with bugs crawling all around it. I asked my counselor to get me another bottom bunk but he refused, pushed me on the floor and we got into a fight with the woman who took my bottom bunk. The police were called and I was taken to jail for assault. My mom bailed me out and I went home. As soon as I got home, I started drinking and the feeling of never getting sober again started to fill me with dread. Then I started crying and asking God why I just can't stay sober. Why me? I ended up crying myself awake with tears in my eyes. While I slowly started to fade into a consciousness I started to see my bottom bunk with all my surroundings and my kitty pillow and Harry Potter blanket. I wiped the tears from my eyes. It was a nightmare. It felt so unbelievably real. I thought I threw away 53 days of sobriety. Waking up from that dream is one of the most reliving moments of my life. \n\nI wasn't arrested for assaulting a cop. I still have my bottom bunk. I still have my good health. I still have my 53 days. I still have my hope. I'm still going to complete this rehab program. \n\nStupid subconscious!

Conveniently, there is a sober group in my city that had a ski trip planned this weekend, but the universe had other plans for me I guess.  A couple of months ago, I was diagnosed with Testicular Cancer, and I am currently stuck in and out of the hospital ripping through chemotherapy rounds. \n\nCancer sucks.  I don't have anything insightful to say about my diagnosis or the way that my life has to be right now for me to get better.  But, I do feel grateful that I got sober and learned how to start to live and feel.  \n\nThe last few years of my drinking were painfully lonely, and I was ready to kill myself over obstacles far more trivial than a metastatic cancer diagnosis. I basically had nothing and no one in my life, and I moved from temporary situation to temporary situation sucking up everyone and everything around me until I felt I was being asked to leave.\n\nOne thousand days later, my life is completely unrecognizable.  I have had a lot of real accomplishments, and it's easy to point to the most tangible ones (career, physical appearance, etc.) to communicate to people who used to know me that I have started to get better.  While it's really easy to show someone else and external change, I find it very difficult at times to show someone how you have changed internally.  \n\nThe day I finally went to detox and decided quit for real, I thought I was making the choice to not wake up with withdrawals every morning, to not have to make excuses for why I was late to work all the time, to not have to go to 3 different liquor stores every day to hide how much alcohol I was buying, etc.  And while I have certainly outgrown all of those things, I did not truly understand the journey I was embarking on until much later.  Working an active program has taught me to build relationships, set boundaries, have goals and try to accomplish them, how to be comfortable with myself, and how to experience feelings (sometimes bad feelings).  It took having these gifts gradually appear in my life as I continued to live sober to prove to me that I truly was drinking to die toward the end.  \n\nI would never say this in a cancer sub or group meeting, but I am confident that this cancer won't kill me.  For a diagnosis like mine, testicular cancer is pretty well cured as long as you get the treatment (which is brutal).  If I start drinking again, I will not only die young, but I will also deprive myself of the chance to ever have lived in the first place.\n\nIf you're new to sobriety or haven't strung a day sober in a long time want to, be kind to yourself.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "2 Year Sober-versary", "text": "Two years ago today, I was discharged from the hospital after being treated for sepsis caused by alcoholic ketoacidosis, and after being medically detoxed.\n\nIt wasn’t my first detox.\n\nFourteen months earlier, I had gone through one before, convinced I just needed a break. I wasn’t committed to sobriety. I told myself that one day I could drink again, that *one drink couldn’t hurt*. That lie nearly cost me my life.\n\nThat “one drink” became a week-long binge I have no memory of. I stopped eating. My body, desperate to survive, tried to sustain itself on alcohol alone. I was actively dying, and the only reason I ended up in the ER was because I collapsed on my bedroom floor, violently vomiting, unable to keep even a sip of water down.\n\nAnd what terrified me most wasn’t that I couldn’t drink the water.\nIt was that I couldn’t drink more vodka.\n\nMy husband was deployed. I was alone. I was taken to the ER, where the first hours of detox brought horrific hallucinations; images and sensations I wish my brain had never learned how to create. Nurses struggled to find a vein. A newer nurse dug so deeply she caused nerve damage; I lost all feeling from my wrist to my elbow. That numbness didn’t begin to fade until six months ago.\n\nThe experience was traumatic. And the realization that I had almost killed myself was undeniable.\n\nAfter my first detox, I hadn’t healed. I was still carrying the weight of my alcoholism. Still shut off from the world. Still holding my shame in silence.\n\nToday, two years later, everything is different.\n\nI’ve committed to a lifetime of sobriety, and the difference is profound. I’ve finally started healing the trauma I once tried to outrun with alcohol. I’m in the best shape of my adult life at 36. My relationships are deeper, more honest, more open than I ever thought possible. And for the first time in as long as I can remember, I genuinely believe my life is good, and worth living.\n\nI’m… dare I say it… happy.\nAnd that is enough for me.\n\nSo here’s to two years.\n\nAnd if you’re reading this with two hours, two days, or two months, wherever you are in your journey, please hear this: it gets better, even if you can’t believe that yet.\n\nThe hopelessness, the darkness, the voice telling you there’s no way out, it’s a lie! A trick your mind plays when it’s worn down by addiction and fear. It feels real because you’re inside it, but it is not the truth of who you are or what your life can be.\n\nThere *is* light on the other side of this. I couldn’t see it either. I was certain my life was over. But slowly, quietly, that light found me, and one day I realized I wasn’t just surviving anymore. I was living.\n\nYou don’t need to see the whole path forward. Just stay. One moment, one choice at a time. The darkness doesn’t win.\n\nYour life is worth fighting for. \n\n💜\n", "score": 35, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768097570.0, "id": "1q9mzdg", "author": "MzPernicious", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q9mzdg/2_year_soberversary/"}

That's easy enough right?\n\nDecember the 19th, I had custody of my children (it's 50/50). I was 3 weeks sober then. But my girlfriend of almost a year took more and more place in my house. I never wished to have her at my home \"permenantly\". I told her she got to go at her home for the time being. Which she did.\n\nAs I went back from her home, I went to the liquor store to buy a bottle of whiskey. I had enough, I needed that. I already knew I was going to leave her. Truth is I wasn't yet ready to have a relationship after my breakup with the mom of my childs in August 2023.\n\nSo I drank. Kids didn't have their diner meal that evening. My daugther was not able to wake me up. Called her mother crying. Their mother came to get the kids at 11:30 pm. She was also not able to wake me up. I woke up in the morning with a note on the table. \"I came to get the kids, you know why\".\n\nI lost the costudy of my kids during the holydays. Starting December the 19th. The holydays after that were not good for me. Left my girlfriend, I was alone, I drank a lot.\n\nI also lost my best friend over something I did while we were both drunk, I was totally alone.\n\nDecember the 30th, I had my first ever suicidal thought. I called the crisis center the next morning to tell them that, I have so much pills at home it would be really easy, and asked what should I do. And I did a google research for that. \"Go to the emergency now\". Which I didn't.\n\nJanuary the 1st, something happened with the mother of my childs, which sent my in crisis. I don't want to talk about that particularly, but I was in distress, like I never had been. I talked to my ex in the morning. She was worried and called the crisis center. 2 social workers came to my home, unnanounced, talked to me. I explained the situation. They went off saying they were worried.\n\nAs the day passed, I was feeling less and less well. I called back to the crisis center to ask when is the right moment to decide when to go to the emergency. Had a small talk, told them I would think about it.\n\nThey (the social workers) came back a few hours later, maybe 9 PM. I told them I would refuse their services. We have a law here in Quebec called P38 that when someone is in danger for itself or somebody else, they can get taken care of against their will. That's what happened. Police showed up, I got into an ambulance, went to the hospital.\n\nI stayed at the psychiatric emergency for a day and a half. Tranfered to the detox center for 2 days (it went really well that time).\n\nThuesday I had a meeting with the CPS. I'm losing custody of my childs for 1 month and need to treat myself, or start doing this. I have the right to have my childs at least one time a week.

I’m really really proud of you for admitting that you need help even if they put you under hold at the psych hospital. I hope you can find the strength inside of you to keep going. You are so resilient and overcoming addiction will show you that you can do anything. And your kids will be so proud of you for doing so! You mentioned you’re in Quebec. I’m in Ontario, but I have a friend in Montreal who struggled with alcohol abuse as well. There are zoom meetings and in-person AA meetings in both French and English. If you google AA+the city you live in you will find one. The good thing about AA is that you can mingle and talk to people and make sober friends! After attending a few meetings, I met a couple other women there and now we hang out outside of meetings, doing healthy sober things like hiking, shopping, sitting around by the beach and playing badminton…once you get a circle of sober friends you’ll feel a lot better. You’re going through a lot with your ex so you need some supportive people in your life who can show you there is joy on the other side. If you’re not interested in AA there is also Smart Recovery. I hope your appointment with your psychiatrist goes well, my advice is be completely honest with her, they can hook you up with an addictions counsellor (it may take a while, this is Canada after all haha) but I don’t pay a dime to see my addictions counsellor. There is also the Affordable Therapy Network, check out their site and see if you can find a therapist within a price range that works for you. There are so many resources out there! I’m really rooting for you and your family, you can do this, just one day at a time. Just for today don’t drink - and the next day make a promise to yourself to not drink either - after a while the days will stack up and you’ll feel much better. Go for a walk, get some fresh air (even though it’s freezing outside lol) and reflect on ways you can help yourself. You are loved and cared for, you belong on this earth the best version you can be, and I believe you can do it, both for yourself and for your children.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "First of all, good for you knowing you are aware of your problem and trying all you can to control it. Always know that. \n\nI am only speaking from my experience. I've been thru rehab twice for drinking. It's damn hard to quit it. It's like losing your security blanket of coping with things in life. I felt like I was stripped of my security blanket and forced to walk naked into the world. It's scary, overwhelming and very humbling. \n\nI too started drinking after my daughter was born. Being a parent was overwhelming to me. I was young, married &amp; had recently started living on my own with my husband. It was a huge change in life for me. I realized a lot my first stint in rehab. People i thought were my friends were nowhere to be found once they learned I couldn't drink anymore. I got treated like I had some contagious disease. It hurt bad being treated that way. I felt even more overwhelmed and lonely. My 2 year marriage was falling apart because he didn't have a drinking problem, I did. We were young and he didn't understand addiction, so naturally he couldn't give the support I needed after rehab. \n\nMy counselor advised me to attend AA meetings as well. I went to several meetings over the course of a few months, but there was something nagging about those meetings that never sat right with me. I still felt like I was being judged at almost every meeting. I ended up going to an NA meeting even though my addiction wasn't drugs, it was alcohol. I never felt more welcomed than I did at those NA meetings. I felt belongingness there. It was something I'd never felt at AA meetings. \n\nMy life changed again about 10 years later and I fell off the wagon. I went thru rehab again after several years off the wagon. One thing that always stuck in my head was something my counselor said to me during my 2nd rehab stint.. he said in order to stay sober, you only have to change 1 thing. That 1 thing is everything. You need to change everything. I did just that. I changed everything, except sell the house and move. I drastically changed careers and I believe that's what helped save me. I needed something drastic to shift my focus onto. AA doesn't always work for everyone.. we all don't fit into a cookie cutter lifestyle suggested way of living. I appreciate what AA is about, but I've surrounded myself with other ways that help keep me sober. My job has screwy hours with no set schedule, so that sort of helps keep my brain focused. Plus, I read a lot of self help books, articles &amp; listen to self help podcasts and audiobooks. Like they say in the program, take what you need and leave the rest. I've gradually worked my own program to keep me straight. I challenge myself and my skills.. it keeps that nasty little monster from chatting in my brain to just have a drink. \n\nYou can do this honey. I have faith in you, and I'm not just saying empty words here..I believe in you and you can do this. Yes, it's hard as hell somedays, but you've gotta look at the rewards of sobriety and also challenge yourself each time you get an urge or when that nasty little monster starts his chatting in your brain. Cook something you've never made before, read a self help book, go for a drive and turn on a podcast, volunteer to help someone do something, whatever it may be to shift your focus away from that chatter until it passes. There's a lot of love and support on this sub, so please keep coming back.. daily, hourly, etc.. as long as you need to keep coming back. Hang in there. You can do this.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "90 Days - The fog is lifting", "text": "There is not a day that goes by where I do not reflect on this little corner of the internet and what it has meant to me.  I read almost every post and each time I am deeply thankful for the sense of community and encouragement here.\n\nThank you to everyone out there from the bottom of my heart.\n\n90 days was the original stretch goal when I set out to do this.  I'm now going for 180.  Here are some thoughts:\n\n* I had 100's of day 1s.  The first breakthrough was a Dry Jan a few years ago.  Each length of being sober, no matter how small, matters.\n* During stretches of attempting to be sober, I always kept a journal.  It is cruel, unjust and down right evil how my mind would constantly try apply some sort of twisted bias on how wonderful being drunk could be and how much I was missing by being sober.\n* I accounted for every small change I could notice during my attempts and wrote them down.  I literally had to read that top to bottom each time I was tempted to drink as a reminder that my mind was somehow blocking. \n* I also did pushups out of anger when I wanted a drink.  Whatever I was feeling, I got down and did pushups until I collapsed. In the beginning I could barely do 10.  Now I'm hitting the gym 2-3x a week.\n* I used to smoke 15 yrs ago.  While smoking, I could not imagine ever getting up and having a coffee without a smoke.  Same thing with drinking.  I was terrified about losing my Sunday nights watching the game and drinking.  4-6 beers every day.  Benders.  Bottle of wine and 2 DIPAs. After 90 days, I can 100% say I no longer think like this.  Its unreal to me that this is possible.\n\nThis entire stretch of 90 has become an exercise in finding ways to fill the dopamine crush I used to get from drinking.  To me, 10 drinks and a night out with a fireplace and maybe some darts hits a dopamine score of 100.  Its damn near perfect....up until the morning where it goes to -100 dopamine, regret, pain in my stomach and ribs, swollen ankles and exhaustion.\n\nI have come to realize I will never again score a 100 in my life.  However, for me, this is how I'm slowly making the progress towards feeling alive without alcohol (and their related scores on what they mean to me):\n\n* Falling asleep in minutes (10)\n* Fat wallet (7)\n* Weight loss (7)\n* Redness in face is near gone (5)\n* Sex drive (5)\n* Staying calm in moments of crises (4)\n* Not being winded from climbing stairs (3)\n* Clear competitive thoughts and connecting the dots at work (3)\n* Desserts ( 2)\n* Remembering my dreams - which are not as violent as before (1)\n* Driving at night with zero stress (1)\n* Fitting into old clothes (1)\n* NA Beers (1)\n\nI want to say again to this group : you all mean the world to me.  I honestly feel for the first time in my life that I will live longer and be able to watch my kids get married or have kids.  You all have given me the gift of life.", "score": 70, "num_comments": 7, "created_utc": 1768061395.0, "id": "1q97yh8", "author": "quattro767", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q97yh8/90_days_the_fog_is_lifting/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "I had 58 days sober and my wife came out to me. Today is day 59. AMA.", "text": "My entire life shifted under me 24 hours ago and somehow I'm still sober. I'm hoping that somewhere in this thread I'll start to have an inkling how that's happened.\n\nI've been a daily drinker for the last fifteen years, but the last six have been particularly hard. My wife and I took pay cuts to move 200 miles away to a place we thought we could afford to build a better life for ourselves - five weeks later the pandemic lockdowns started. I started drinking more. We managed to buy a home in 2021 and six months later, my wife lost her mother to cancer. She lost her aunt to the same six months after that. I started drinking more.  A miscarriage in 2022, followed by the realization that we were never going to be parents. I started drinking more.\n\nShe had been out as bisexual for a few years by then and after so much pain I was determined to try and bring more joy into her life, to do anything I could so that she could be more fully herself. We tried polyamory. We tried ethical non-monogamy. She met a woman she fell head over heels for and nine months later, she broke things off completely because of the lies she'd been told and how poorly I'd been treated. I was drinking much, much more by then. I remember how much of that summer I spent alone in our home, wondering what had happened to us. I remember how large a queen size bed felt when I was sleeping alone. I don't remember too much else.\n\nAfterwards we tried therapy, we tried couples therapy, and we tried couples therapy again. By this point I was going through a handle of 100 proof bourbon every 48 hours and I genuinely believed that since I could stop for a day or three or five and tend to whatever business I needed to it wasn't really a problem. She prefers cannabis, I prefer liquor, nobody's judging anybody and as long as everything's fine, then everything's fine.\n\n58 days ago, she asked me to stop. Not for a week, not for two, but to *stop.* Ninety days, at least, and then see where my head was at. She told me that it felt like I loved drinking more than I loved her, that she could not stand to see me making myself so small, that as confused as she was about everything that's happened she couldn't find a way to desire me when I was so dedicated to dulling my senses, that whatever we were going through could not possibly be helped by incrementally poisoning myself.\n\nShe said that it was only because she knew what kind of man I was and could be that she was having this conversation with me instead of a lawyer.\n\nThat one sentence sobered my simple ass up right quick. Everything out of the house that night, cold turkey then and there. Yes, I know, that's *very* stupid, but in my defense, so am I.\n\nI've been lucky so far in that regard. No physical withdrawal symptoms, no sleep disturbance, no mood swings, no anxiety spikes. My bloodwork shows no abnormalities at all. My therapist told me a few days ago that she's been doing substance abuse recovery work since the mid nineties and she's absolutely certain I don't have an alcohol problem (which is a whole different story that I'm not sure would be helpful here - I'll say that there came a time that I decided to become a functional alcoholic and we'll leave it at that. Like I said earlier, *very* stupid, but so am I!)\n\nI was starting to feel like I'd actually gotten away with it. That I didn't have to hit rock bottom, that my life didn't need to be rebuilt from the ground up at the age of 41. Okay, yeah, my job is absolutely ending on 4/30 and yeah, there's no relevant work where I live and yeah, the amount of debt we're carrying could crush us at any moment, but you know what? I got sober on COMMAND, my guys! I have the constitution of an ox and I can probably leap tall buildings in a single bound if I really tried hard, am I right? Willpower and discipline and the impossibly loving support of my wife, who -\n\nIs gay.\n\nYes, she's sure. No, nothing was faked. Nothing was forced. She wishes it wasn't the case. She's sure. She loves me. She's always loved me. She wishes more than anything that the person who helped her build a life where she could finally be who she is wasn't the one this will hurt to the core. Yes, she's sure.\n\nShe doesn't want to leave. She doesn't want a divorce. She loves me and she's proud of what I've done and she's proud of what we've built and she's sure. She swears that one day she's going to be the best wingman anybody ever had, she's going to make sure every woman I ever look at twice knows what she'd be passing up and she is god-damn *sure.*\n\nEverything I've done for the last decade of my life I've done so that one day she could feel safe enough to be all of who she is, whatever that might mean. I gave my word, and while I never dreamt that this might be what it takes to keep it, well, that's really too bad, because I gave my fucking word. When and if there comes a day there's a woman she wants to marry instead, I will send my fifty dollars to the universal life church and I will perform that ceremony myself and I will never do anything harder than that because even through a drunken haze a decade long I delivered what I promised and she is absolutely, positively sure.\n\nAnd that brings me, somehow, to day 59. I've read this back over twice and I don't see what could've been different any more than I see how I'm going to make it to day 60. But there's not a drop of alcohol in the house, I'm making another cup of tea, and if I can stand to sit in the ash and dust of my life for another handful of hours, I'll get to do the very same thing tomorrow. And the day after that, and the day after *that...*\n\nMaybe it's a stupid way to look at things but, well, y'know.\n\nAMA.\n\n===============================================\n\nEDIT 1.10.2026, 12:43PM EST:\n\nI am decidedly and dramatically unprepared for the response this thing has gotten, y'all, god-DAMN. I don't know how to appropriately return the support I've gotten here today. Thank each and every one of you, truly.\n\nGiven the visibility this has right now, there's one thing in particular I feel compelled to make very clear: in *absolutely no way* does this constitute a lie or a betrayal of any kind on the part of my wife as far as I'm concerned. I have said yes to *every single step* that led us to today. In fact, I've been the one to push us onward on occasion when she was afraid of what all of this could mean for us.\n\nWhen she first came out to me, I gave her my word that if there ever came a time she felt she needed to explore herself in this fashion, she would do so with my knowledge and consent, whatever that might mean. I told her that I couldn't bring myself to ask her to keep herself small or stunted or in any way less than the fullness of who she is just because she happened to be marrying a man. And when we were married, we wrote our own vows and I swore that I would always lift her towards the light, whatever that might cost.\n\nI very deliberately did not say a single word about fidelity.\n\nThe first sentence she ever said to me was \"Fuck you, you're wrong.\" I love that this is how she introduced herself into my life just as much as I love her. That energy has propelled us forward at times I couldn't have seen a way through on my own. That energy inspired this post just like it has 60 days of sobriety. And if one day still to come we should crash and burn despite our lofty dreams and best intentions, well, hey.\n\nFuck me, I was wrong!", "score": 1443, "num_comments": 132, "created_utc": 1768002067.0, "id": "1q8o81s", "author": "an_irrelevant_life", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8o81s/i_had_58_days_sober_and_my_wife_came_out_to_me/"}

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "I appreciate the comment. Seeing the response my post has generated this morning (which I am extremely unprepared for!) does make it important for me to clarify something regarding your second point - these are decisions we're making together, implausible as that might sound. Implausible as I'm sure it's going to feel some days, if I'm gonna keep being honest.\n\nThese are issues she and I have talked...around, I think, over the past couple of years. Neither one of us was really ready to face it before, but she has admittedly had more time and space in which to process all our possibilities than I have. Part of that it because the question of her sexuality is hers and hers alone to answer, and another part of that is that I chose to hide from the realities of our lives thus far in the bottom of a bottle for as long as I could. But at 60 days sober I'm just as sure I want her to stay as she is that she's going to.\n\nAs far as grieving what was lost and what will never come to pass? The original post is a critical part of that process for me, as are my responses today. I can't and won't pretend that this isn't one of the most painful and shattering experiences of my life, but I also can't pretend that I am in any way a victim here.\n\nI *insisted* on opening this door for her. I cannot in good conscience conceive of slamming it behind her because she trusted me enough to walk through it.\n\nI can't say with any surety that we will in fact remain married until question marks, or that I'll never hurt so much or grow in so different a direction that physical and legal space won't become necessary for us both. I can say that she is to this day the best and truest friend I've ever had in my life, that our lifestyles and outlooks and senses of humor are compatible and complementary in ways I did not believe possible before I met her.\n\nSo far we both think that's enough to build on until it isn't.", "score": 19, "created_utc": 1768063013.0, "id": "nyt63ae", "author": "an_irrelevant_life"}

I'm *really* not. \n\n(Although on the flip side of that argument, whatever mythical woman *would* like to meet the gay wife guy is probably somebody I'd be very interested in talking to.

I'm 41 now and by the time our living situation isn't so completely dictated by our debt burden, I'll be at least 45. How many more years, exactly, do I believe my sexual appetite is going to be such a driving force in my life? How many more years do I *want* it to be such a primary concern?

It's hard to see the forest for the trees these days, but you've given me an invaluable moment to zoom out and see the question I'm actually trying to answer.\n\nIt's not who will make me feel desired and wanted tomorrow or the day after that.\n\nIt's who do I want to grow old with?\n\nAnd the answer to *that* isn't going to change.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart for helping me see that clearly.", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768089896.0, "id": "nyvp2ld", "author": "an_irrelevant_life"}

Philosophy has long been an interest of mine, as a matter of fact, and while it's been some years since I pursued it even semi-seriously I find myself returning to Foucault these last few days. From an interview he gave in '81 on \"Friendship as a Way of Life\" (emphasis in italics is mine):\n\n\"One of the concessions one makes to others is not to present homosexuality as anything but a kind of immediate pleasure...There you have a kind of neat image of homosexuality without any possibility of generating unease, and for two reasons: it responds to a reassuring canon of beauty, and *it cancels everything that can be troubling in affection, tenderness, friendship, fidelity, camaraderie, and companionship, things that our rather sanitized society can't allow a place for without fearing the formation of new alliances and the tying together of unforeseen lines of force.*\n\nI think that's what makes homosexuality 'disturbing': the homosexual mode of life, much more than the sexual act itself. To imagine a sexual act that doesn't conform to law or nature is not what disturbs people. *But that individuals are beginning to love one another - there's the problem.* The institution \\[of marriage\\] is caught in a contradiction; affective intensities traverse it which at one and the same time keep it going and shake it up. Look at the army, where love between men is ceaselessly provoked and shamed. *Institutional codes can't validate these relations with multiple intensities, variable colors, imperceptible movements and changing forms. These relations short-circuit it and introduce love where there's supposed to be only law, rule or habit.\"*\n\nTomorrow may well bring me something completely different, but this certainly rings true for me today.", "score": 0, "created_utc": 1768058598.0, "id": "nysr010", "author": "an_irrelevant_life"}

When I don’t go out for a walk, the day feels much harder to get through &amp; my self-talk is a lot more harsher.\n\nSometimes even just making sure I’ve showered and made myself a home cooked meal, watched a comfort show/film or put a face mask on makes me feel like I’ve accomplished something because I *still* have not drank any alcohol. \n\nEverything else can wait right now. This stage of your life is just about getting through today/tomorrow/this week without drinking. \n\nBut my biggest piece of advice: keep yourself away from anyone who may directly or indirectly sabotage your sobriety. My biggest triggers are my family (as they don’t like to respect my boundaries) so I limit the time and energy I spend on/with them. Again, the ‘I am sober’ app has also shown me the pattern of me interacting with them = triggers my depression and increases my urge to drink vs minimal to none/low-effort interactions with family = stronger sense of self and will to remain sober.\n\nIf you haven’t tried therapy, I would highly suggest this as they might be able to help you with some coping tools.\n\nAnd if you don’t feel comfortable opening up to your friends/family about your depression and anxiety, try journaling or ChatGPT (just don’t rely too much on the latter as it usually just tells you what you want to hear, or will repeatedly redirect you to mental help services instead - rightfully so, but sometimes you just need to vent lol).\n\nIWNDWYT🤍", "score": 2, "created_utc": 1768098301.0, "id": "nywfegz", "author": "Responsible-Fill-113"}

Of course I started craving a glass of wine after I finished it but we all left and I just... decided it wasn't worth it.\n\nThing is, I'm a trans guy and getting misgendered is really uncommon at this state in my transition because I've grown a decent goatee, but for some reason one of my coworkers always misgenders me and my manager started to as well during the dinner (she never did before). So that stung a little. At some point she told me I seemed to have a rounder face than before as compared to a few months ago when it was more defined. I said I gained some weight. My weight fluctuates, not much, but when I'm a bit heavier, my face gets rounder (more feminine) and my chest appears bigger.\n\nI used to take walks for hours and hours most nights. Since August I've been drinking and not moving much. So one more reason to stay sober for me: the booze makes me look like a woman to those who already know I'm trans. The weight gain doesn't bother me so much, but the regression in my transition? That just sucks. \n\nI had a fun time, but I'm still a bit hurt about the misgendering.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "Am I sober or do I just not drink anymore? Either way, a year has passed.", "text": "Hi there,\n\nOn January 5th, 2025, I finally did it — I stopped drinking alcohol. Not for a week, not until the weekend, not until the next holiday or my birthday, or any other date I used to set as a limit (or as a “fresh start” to drink again). No more rules like “no hard alcohol,” “no drinking alone,” “just beer,” or “only one booze-filled day on a weekend.” Done.\n\nI drank for nearly 20 years and finally stopped when I was 35. I never felt comfortable with myself. I was insecure, and when I discovered how alcohol made me feel — good, relaxed, confident — I fell in love with it. Nothing could stop me. I took every chance to drink. But once I started, I could never stop. One glass became one gulp, like someone lost in the Sahara finally finding water. Always. So every night was too much.\n\nMy drinking never sent me to the hospital, but it made me do bad things. My character changed, and I lost a lot of friends. When I was drunk, I didn’t care if the girl I liked was already someone else's (my friends) girlfriend. I became arrogant, reckless, and all my insecurities came out. No one wanted to spend time with me.\n\nI dated many girls, made them like the version of me I showed them, and when things got serious, I ghosted them. I moved to the countryside and started drinking with neighbors — but most of the time, I drank alone.\n\nA typical Friday: grocery shopping, a bottle of whiskey, and a “Kasten Bier” (that’s a crate of 20 half-liter bottles here in Europe). Two big packs of Marlboro, BBQ started, first beer. Second. Third. My girlfriend came home from work — we made whiskey coke. I finished mine in a minute, poured another, then another. She said, “You’re drinking fast today.” “It’s just my second one,” I lied. Another beer, so she wouldn’t notice. She went to bed; I stayed outside, drinking, smoking, listening to music until 2 a.m.\n\nAt 5 a.m., I woke up: heart racing, heartburn, no sleep. Did I call someone? No idea — I always deleted everything before bed. I took the dog out, feeling like shit, hoping not to meet anyone. Spent the day on the couch, shaking a bit when walking, regretting everything. Saturday evening: probably two or three beers again. Sunday: summer, so some wine (well, a bottle) at lunch. Or Aperol. Buzzed by 3 p.m., stopped at 4 because I had work on Monday. Work? Right. Those mornings, I went to the office praying not to get stopped by police.\n\nDuring rough times at work, I drank four to seven beers almost every night just to calm down. Over time, I lost interest in any activity that didn’t include alcohol. Even when cycling on my exercise bike, I had two whiskey cokes (Zero ...) next to me. I couldn’t imagine eating out without drinking. Even at my godchild’s second birthday, I was the one who opened the fridge to grab beer first. On vacations, I was drunk every day.\n\nAfter more than 10 years, I changed jobs. Better pay, a nicer company car, a big title. First day — I had a hangover and hoped no one would notice. I quit smoking. The result: I drank even more. I thought, “This can’t be right.” So I stopped drinking for four months. I was proud, told everyone. The new company was full of heavy drinkers, but I had no problem being the sober one.\n\nThe job turned out terrible, and I became depressed. After four months, my girlfriend and I went to a Brauhaus, and I thought it was the perfect time for a few “Altbier” and a pork knuckle. Three weeks later, I was fully back in the game.\n\nThen I got sick — a serious motor nerve disease. I lost my job, went from hospital to hospital, and drank a lot. After medical treatments, I even googled whether it was okay to drink afterward. When my health improved, we went on vacation — I got so drunk the first night that the whole club knew me. We met some great people who later spent Christmas at our house. I bought a lot of alcohol — three bottles of liquor, two crates of beer, twelve bottles of wine, twelve bottles of mulled wine. Not all of it got finished, but I was prepared.\n\nWe had a great weekend, but when the new year started, I felt awful. My pain came back, I’d gained a lot of weight, stopped training, and felt completely empty. On January 5th, 2025, I was already hungover for the fourth time that year. Drinking alone at night until I was drunk — again — arguing with my girlfriend, telling her how much I hated my life.\n\nThat day, I finally admitted to myself that I couldn’t control my drinking — that I drank because I was unhappy and trying to bury my thoughts.\n\nI told no one. The next days felt fine — like always after a hangover. But something was missing. I had nothing to look forward to. Drinking had been my only goal. So what now? How to celebrate, relax, fill time? What would I do with friends if I didn’t drink?\n\nMy close friends rarely drink, so I was always the one bringing alcohol and drinking most. At first, those situations were stressful — moments where I’d normally start drinking. But they passed. After 15, 30, maybe 60 minutes, the feeling was gone. And at the end of the night, lying in bed with my girlfriend, I thought: “That was a nice evening. Even without alcohol.”\n\nIn the early weeks, I often woke up in a panic: “What did I do last night? Did I drink?” Then I’d remember: “You idiot. You don’t drink anymore.” My godchild’s next birthday was great too. I could drive home, had good conversations, and discovered some lemonade I really liked. Bit by bit, I started enjoying things again — hiking without wine, dinners without booze, moments I’d forgotten.\n\nThe people I used to drink with? I haven’t seen them in a long time. And that’s fine.\n\nPhysically, I’m still struggling. I live with a chronic pain condition that affects my nervous system, and nobody can tell me if it will ever get better. My professional and financial future feels uncertain, and sometimes that thought alone can be heavy. But I know one thing for sure: drinking again would never make any of it better. It would only make everything worse — my health, my mind, my relationships, my hopes. I’m also getting married soon, and I know I can only keep my vows if I’m fully in control of myself — of what I do, what I say, and who I am. And that’s only possible when I’m sober.\n\nSo — am I sober? In German, we say trockener Alkoholiker — “dry alcoholic.” Or did I just stop drinking? It was easy for me to stop, but sometimes hard not to start again. I made a list in my head of what would happen if I “just had one.” One glass, then another, then a third. The next day I’d want one at lunch, waiting for the moment when it felt “okay” again to start drinking later that day.\n\nI have to admit that I can’t control my alcohol consumption. That’s why I can never drink again — not even for pleasure.\n\nAnd that’s why I will never drink alcohol again!\n\nIf you’ve read my story all the way to the end — thank you. I really enjoy reading all the stories here and feel genuinely happy for everyone who has found a new version of themselves.

My drinking allowed me to do bad things and I ended up with an HIV scare (false positve, HOLY FUCK!!) that brought the weight of the stars down on me. \n\nShortly before that fucking mind-bender started, I had my ah ha moment. A switch flipped and I said no more. I finally had reached the point where I could tell myself never again.

When alcohol leaves your system, chemical imbalances conspire to convince you of this lie. They last, compound, and eventually you’re living in its reality rather than your own.\n\nI know that quiet, unfun, anxious person really well. It’s me, and all of us, when the booze is in charge. I know that personable, relaxed, anxiety-free illusion of self, too - it’s what we tell ourselves we are with it, when what others see is often something quite different.

But I no longer believe some people “can handle it/moderate” and others can’t—rather, some people use alcohol as a purposeful tool, and others don’t.

You’re putting a barrier between yourself and growth and convincing yourself that alcohol is somehow the answer when it will only take years of your life from you. There are other options for managing anxiety. There are plenty of people out there who suffer from anxiety and manage it without alcohol, you can do the same. Alcohol is insidious and the addiction makes us lie to ourselves.

I don’t know how to help you, other than to just be real and honest with you. My dad thought no one could tell either, but most of my memories of him were him being either a way too happy drunk or being passed out and not present because the more you drink the more you need to drink to feel normal. He died at 46 from cirrhosis of the liver. I would rather my son know me as moody and irritable than as an alcoholic. But you know, it’s been years now since I drank and I have nightmares about relapsing because I’ve never been happier than I am now.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "It takes time for your subconscious to catch up to your conscious decision making. \n\nEvery time you drank because you were anxious / stressed / nervous you were teaching your subconscious that alcohol is the quickest way to resolve those feelings. Depending on how long you've been drinking, those neural associations can run deep and as such, take time to unwind. \n\nThe book Alcohol Explained does a great job of illustrating that the speed at which alcohol affects us (i.e. very quickly) is why our subconscious says \"yes, this is a good solution to the current problem\". On the flip side, all of the negative effects from alcohol happen some time period after such that your subconscious' ability to attribute those things to the alcohol is long gone.\n\nYou are not a fraud if you are not drinking! To help solidify your motivation, I encourage you to take note (either mentally or literally in a journal) every time you notice something positive about sobriety. Waking up refreshed, feeling energized, being emotionally calm. The intention there will start to teach your subconscious that you don't need alcohol.\n\nTLDR: it takes time for your brain to understand the why; the only thing you need to focus on right now is abstaining. \n\nSidenote, I can't recommend Alcohol Explained enough. Understanding all of the negative physiological effects that alcohol imparts onto truly every part of the human body was such a huge step in my intrinsic motivation to stop.\n\nYou're crushing it, keep up the great work! \n\nIWNDWYT", "score": 1, "created_utc": 1768099221.0, "id": "nywi9c4", "author": "Slippery__Slope__"}

So brutally brutally hard and isolating and I found so much comfort sitting in my home group Christmas eve. We watched movies and had an ice cream bar and it was filled with other people as depressed as I was, though we were quickly laughing and checking in on one another. \n\nThis go around in feeling much more hopeful, mainly because of the work on myself I have put in and the support groups I have found. \n\nThere are still absolute shit days, but a shit day sober still seems much better than the hangxiety at 4am following even a good drunk day. \n\nThanks for everyone in this group and IWNDWYT!", "score": 8, "num_comments": 2, "created_utc": 1768099541.0, "id": "1q9noyv", "author": "theDigitalNinja", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q9noyv/90_days/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "Day 14 : I’d like to share my journey", "text": "Greetings all, long time lurker but I’ve never posted or commented as I never felt it was fair to those making a real attempt at sobriety. I’ll try to condense things as much as possible but it will be a lengthy post. \n\n**Background**: \nI moved to a new city all by myself in November 2017 and within a month met the woman I’d eventually marry. I was 24 at the time and she was 21. She was also one of the few girls I’d ever met that actually liked whiskey. We were both already heavily into the electronic music scene and did our fair share of substances on the weekend, especially early in our relationship. However, alcohol was always our thing. We drank 3-4 days per week whether it was bars, concerts, at the pool or even just chilling at home. \n\nEverything changed when COVID hit in 2020, my wife was furloughed at the time and I was working from home. It was fun at first, we could drink all day and had no obligation to be anywhere. We were in a small 1 bed 1 bath apartment at the time, the only space for a desk was in our bedroom. I’m on the phone for work a lot so she’d be trying to sleep while I’m on the phone with contractors at 7am. We decided we wanted more space, started house hunting and wound up finding a great house in the suburbs for a great price. \n\nWe got married in New Orleans in May 2023, drinking was a huge part of the experience. We managed to not get too lit and had a wonderful time that we actually were able to remember. \n\n**when the problem started** \nI was part of a 2 man team managing the financial side of a $350,000,000 construction project. He was a great boss, mentor and friend. In January 2024 he called me out of the blue to say he’s leaving the company to start his own. I was happy for him but it put a ton of pressure on me as I was now having to handle his client-facing responsibilities and work load on top of my responsibilities. I also had to travel once per month for a site visit which was something he’d normally do since he lived in town. \n\nI had been pretty good about not drinking during work hours but as the stressed piled up I found myself making a run to the liquor store in the late morning/early afternoon to get 3-4 of those disgusting 99 proof liqueur shots. Soon that became a daily habit plus my wife would bring home some shots when she was off work. \n\nLater that year my wife and I had a week long stay at an all inclusive resort in Mexico, I was beyond excited to step away from work plus I could drink as much as I wanted. I blacked out a few days and also got cut off a few times. Our last night there we were both shitfaced and got into an argument that cumulated in my wife screaming **“you’ve ruined the one vacation that we had together this year. I hate you. Do you hear me? I fucking hate you!”** I’ll never forget it, she fell asleep immediately after and when we woke up to head to the airport she didn’t even remember it. While she was apologetic and affectionate, I knew there was a part of what she said that was true. I hated myself and knew what we had grown into wasn’t sustainable. That’s when I recognized that I had a problem. \n\nI was getting burnt out of the job due to the lack of support plus the project itself was nearing completion. My former boss called me out of the blue in march 2025 saying a friend of his needed help on a $7,000,000,000 project. I transitioned jobs because that was good good of an opportunity to pass up and that’s where I work currently. The project is unlike anything I’ve ever worked on but it is stressful, demanding and chaotic. \n\nThose 3-4 99 shots turned into a daily 8 and I’d be at the liquor store 20 minutes after it opened. I’d been battling a depression because it felt like I traded one stressful job for another. I got started on Zoloft which provided immense relief at first but it kinda plateaued after a few weeks so I had my dr up the dosage in early December 2025. \n\n**the tipping point** \nOn 12/27/25 my wife dragged me to one of those timeshare presentations where they try to sell you the world but you get a free week vacation even if you don’t buy anything. I felt weird all morning and was having some sort of double vision (while sober) and overall just felt off. The presenter even noticed something was off and asked if I was alright. I was just focused on getting through the presentation so we could grab some drinks and go home plus my parents were coming into town and I was excited to see them. I remember greeting them and watching some football but that’s about it. That would be my last day drinking. \n\nI woke up on 12/28/25 with a hangover, but it felt different than other hangovers. I was sweating and shaking profusely as well as constantly vomiting even though my stomach was empty. My mom eventually convinced me to go to the ER. \n\nWe sat in the waiting room for 2 hours before my name was called. I could barely walk to the wheelchair they brought for me. During the assessment I had a seizure followed by a loss of pulse and I was turning cyanotic (blue). CPR was administered along with defibrillation, upon return of pulse I was given epinephrine and then moved to the ICU. My wife, as my emergency contact, got to be the one to receive the news and then inform my parents. \n\nI woke up with my hands restrained to a bed, ventilator tube down my throat and a Foley catheter in my manhood. Also was given fentanyl for the pain / sedation so I had no idea what was going on. My dad stayed overnight with me, my poor wife had been through so much emotionally that day and needed rest. She and my mom fell asleep on the living room couch watching comfort movies. \n\nMy dad informed me of the events that transpired but I was unable to speak due to the intubation. The nurse suggested seeing if I could write on a piece of paper, first thing I wrote was “tube out” which wasn’t gonna happen yet. Then “water” which was not possible with the tube. After that was “nose itch” which resulted in my dad scratching all over my nose until he finally found the spot, it was fairly comical. The last thing I wrote was “photo” and my dad got an amazing photo of me, hooked up to all these machines, ice pack on my head, with a thumbs up. I wanted the photo as a reminder of what I did to myself. Another notable part was how much my dad held my hand and even at one point kissed my forehead saying “you got this buddy”. I can’t even remotely remember anything like that happened with him. \n\nOnce I was stable and able to breathe on my own (around 24 hours) they removed the tube which hurt but pales in comparison to the removal of the Foley catheter. That was probably the worst thing I have ever physically experienced. \n\nI spent a total of 10 days in the hospital, first 2 were in the ICU before “graduating” to a regular hospital room. Tests were ran and images were taken. Had to be honest about my drinking as my liver was enlarged and unhappy. An MRI revealed a heart condition (genetic) called Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, essentially a thickening of the heart walls that can cause arrhythmia and makes the heart work harder. I had to have surgery to get a defibrillator implanted in my chest in the event that my pulse ever stops again. \n\nI’m lucky to be alive, who knows what would have happened if I seized up and went into cardiac arrest at home. The lead cardiologist referred to it as a “death attempt”. I was fortunate to be going through the initial withdrawals while under medical supervision, they hooked me up with anti nausea and anti seizure medications. To be honest, the cravings haven’t even been that bad since I was discharged. \n\nThis event made me realize how fortunate I am to have a strong support system. My wife was amazing the whole time, she was strong and caring, stayed in the hospital with me every night besides the first. She even called my boss from my cell phone to inform him of the situation. My parents stayed at our house for over a week longer than originally planned to help with our household and be there to support me and my wife. It makes me feel awful about who I was at the height of my drinking. The hiding it, the excuses to “run out” to do something just so I could grab more drinks, falling asleep in the middle of the day, gaining weight, no interest in hobbies, knowing which stores open early on the weekend, vomiting all the time, stumbling around at concerts, the list could go on forever. \n\n12/27/25 was the day of my last drink and I am ready to take sobriety seriously. I know it won’t be easy but I’ve been given a new lease on life and plan on making the most out of it. I’ve already joined an outpatient program and also look forward to utilizing this community. \n\nI Will Not Drink With You Today.

I took note of my alcohol dependence a while ago, but after last summer  things snowballed downhill and I started losing control (or maybe not caring, like depression it can be cyclical). My mental health plummeted a scary amount. \n\nDuring December I recognized I needed a change before I lose complete control and ruin my life. For the first time in a while, I started thinking to the future. I wanted to continue life in the best way possible, and part of it is with a good grasp on my relationship with alcohol. I don’t know if I’ll cut it out completely, but setting boundaries doing dry january felt like a less-scary start. I really just take it day by day, and I’ve already noticed improvements. \n\nShort story long, I could not be happier that I didn’t go out and drink with my friends last night (if I weren’t doing dry january I know that I would have). Apparently the night started fine for them, but things took a turn for the worse when they got to the bar. Two of my friends drank way more than they should have in a very short period of time (on top of not eating proper dinner). My sober friend there was the dd, and apparently it was messy. \n\nI was told they kept stumbling, spilling people’s drinks, falling over many times, and had to be carried out of the bar. Also throwing up inside/outside of the bar. Then in the car which still needs to be cleaned. They don’t drink like that often at all, and I think they just forgot their tolerance, but it was an all around a very bad situation. I feel empathetic because I know that being that drunk sucks ass, especially having to face everything the morning after. Obviously if I were there (sober) I would have helped them get home and be safe, but I’m so glad I didn’t go out. It felt like a reminder for why I’m doing this. I know it sounds crude to call that terrible night a mini win for myself, but that’s honestly how I feel. \n\nBefore, I never thought I could stay sober for long periods of time, now I have confidence in myself that I can :)\n\nIWNDWYT", "score": 6, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1768084718.0, "id": "1q9i02p", "author": "BigGuarantee4134", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q9i02p/friends_went_out_so_glad_i_didnt/"}

Long story short, I was in a bad way last April already when my dad had a serious stroke. That was unfortunately the catalyst I needed to finally take the plunge and quit drinking. It's been a long, scary, incredibly challenging 262 days, but all things considered I am in a much better place now than I ever thought possible even with everything going on. \n\nDoctors had been telling me to quit for health reasons for several years, and I can't believe I waited so long to listen. \n\nAnxiety and blood pressure are in check and I'm off of 2 blood pressure meds and one anxiety med. Insomnia is still a major challenge but I'm getting much better sleep now that I'm not drinking. I've resolved many financial issues in my life and headed back towards a normal credit score. Most recently I've re-enrolled in school and working to finish my almost-completed bachelor's degree from over 10 years ago. \n\nLife still sucks sometimes. Dad's health is still poor. Working, caregiving, and traveling 200 miles between those two responsibilities every week is wearing on me. The desire to drink comes on strong when the going gets tough, but I've stayed strong even with other caretakers drinking in the house and reuniting with old drinking buddies now that I'm back in my home town more. \n\nStopping drinking didn't solve all of my problems, but boy did it help.\n\nIf you are considering quitting, there is no time like the present. If I have one regret, it's not doing it sooner. \n\nThanks to everyone on here for the support and help along the way.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "Tell me your story. While I’m not brand new, I’m seeking guidance from those who once felt they didn’t know who they were. If you can’t offer guidance, give your story regardless.", "text": "TL;DR:. Tell me your story. I’m telling some of mine. whether you’re new, back at it, Or decades sober. I’d like to hear you contribute.\n\nHi all,\n\nEverybody, especially addicts, have a story. Sharing these stories can be cathartic,  traumatizing, insightful, or inspiring.\n\nI’ve been off alcohol for about 2 years and two months now. I’ve had had a good 16 months of full sobriety before I began exploring or revisiting things other than alcohol. I never got physically and mentally addicted to anything else the way I did booze, but I definitely put a big pause on the progress I was making. I realized while I was having fully sober days, there was still this sense of escapism. That due to my substance use starting from at age of 12, I never really let myself “become” anyone. Well I obviously did, but who is he?\n\nYou know the accurate trope for many addicts. That they wake up one day not knowing who they are anymore? That they got lost somewhere and need to get back home? I’ve never had that. I’m multiple weeks fully sober, still same 14 months alcohol free. I’ve been attending groups, going to therapy and I’ve been trying new things as often as I can. I feel like a piece of me is terrified that “What if who I am doesn’t like anything except consumption?” Not just consumption of substances but of food, books, media, and heavy phone dopamine addiction. A consumer not a creator.\n\nI’m grateful to have many many very close friends and family. Despite being introverted, I have a LOT of good people in my life. They all speak so highly of me. I try as often as I can to uplift them in kind. I don’t need to solicit hearing earnest kind words like “people are drawn to you”, “you put people at ease”, and “you’re one of the most compassionate people I know.” I sure as hell would like to know this guy people talk about. My goal for this year is “learn to be confidently, fully myself, whoever the hell that is.” Do I subconsciously have people fooled or\n\nAll I know about myself is the following:\n\n1. I am an addict and my life is incompatible with substances\n\n2. I love to cook learn , read, and write. I’m nourishing that to the best of my ability \n\n3. I’m a dreamer but undisciplined. I abhor routine but do well under it \n\n4. I’m lucky. While life has been difficult, I’m not my trauma, I’m not the trauma I’ve caused others, and when confronted with these feelings I need to sit with them. My community is one of my greatest assets. Don’t ruminate and take accountability.\n\n5. I am an introverted extrovert. I need people, but I’ve always needed a real extrovert to kick that door in. How do I learn to do this on my own? How do I learn to love myself and know myself the way my loved ones know me? If I had a 1/3 of the qualities people thrust up on me I’d at least be a flawed and interesting person I’d want to know.\n\nSo for the once lost, currently lost, the miscreants, ne’er do wells, those who started drinking too soon or too much - how did you get to know yourself? What about love yourself? Has a book or hobby or habit helped you? Is there something you revisit when you feel lost? \n\nWhile I am seeking guidance, I’m also seeking  fearless\n\nconnection. if you don’t have wisdom it I’d love to hear your stories, tell me about you, your journey, your new found or revisited spark. Whether two days sober or twenty years, your voice is valuable. \n\nHell, even making this post I kinda chuckle at the irony of knowing I’m not my thoughts but here I am pathologizing, seeking answers to questions that don’t have one. If they do, they’re mine alone to answer.\n\nIt might just be mindset, self nurturing, and time. Connection in the mean time won’t hurt.\n\nTL;DR: Tell me your story. Whether you can offer guidance as somebody who also stunted themself with alcohol before developing hobbies or knowing yourself, what helped you with this in your sobriety? \n\nFor those who did know but lost themself, what kept you straight &amp; narrow while sobriety walked you home?  \n\nLastly, if you’re in the same boat with me &amp; have no true understanding of who you are tell me your story. Sometimes commiserating or even saying your story out in the ether helps.  You, myself, or passersby’s.\n\nBooks, media, mindset , habits, hobbies, speaking the yet unspoken. Anything that helps or helped that was strictly for you, I’d love to hear it. I don’t mind if you have no guidance, I hope you use this thread to share your story &amp; perspective because it matters \n\nIMWNDWYT", "score": 2, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768103753.0, "id": "1q9p63x", "author": "justathrowawayforth", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q9p63x/tell_me_your_story_while_im_not_brand_new_im/"}

Then it gets so ingrained we do it without thinking it. \n\nBooks like alcohol explained really helped me understand that.\n\nOther books on how our minds work and a fave of mine is the Chimp Paradox by Steve Peters and maybe something like Atomic Habits.\n\nIn short we need to recognise the patterns ( you have identified it) and we have to find a way to introduce a new thought in that moment when we are vaguely aware we are following the old pattern. \n\nFor instance every Thursday for the last few years I got a Friday feeling because I worked from home on Friday so Thursday was the new Friday in my head. No matter how many times I said ‘I’m NOT going to the pub this week’ I found the little light switch would just ping on come 3 pm Thursday and my subconscious would start thinking about the pub and I’d message people and (so manipulative) tell them I was thinking about it, triggering their little light switch because once the thought is there we are all going to the pub.\n\nI found it very hard to break. But this time on quitting I would find myself thinking about it and say to my brain ‘we are not going to the pub we don’t drink any more’ , not as simple as just saying but I had also done the preparation in thinking this is just a thought, it’s not the law because I think something I have to do it, and I had thought a lot about all the reasons I do not want to keep up that habit, it’s still hard work, or I’d phone my husband and say it aloud ‘I’m just thinking about going to the pub but I know I said I won’t drink’ and he’d have a conversation with me and that small distraction was enough to disarm the notion long enough for me to get on the train home. \n\nI’ve done it enough times it is just a faint flicker now and I can ignore it because another neural pathway has been built to say ‘you always have this thought on a Thursday but now you ignore it’ \n\nSometimes I know it’s NOT actual beer I want but the ritual of recognising the week is almost over and believe it or not I now sometimes DO go to the pub but it’s for an NA Guinness or a soft drink. Because going to the pub was never solely about alcohol for me. It was a place of community and a kind of neutral place to hang with my husband or friends.\n\n\nIn short we need to replace the habit or distract ourselves, enough times that it’s no longer the only thing we do.

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "Thank you for your service, and I'm sorry you are struggling right now.  When you are drinking alcohol, you are flooding your brain with an unnatural amount of dopamine.  In response, your brain kills off dopamine receptors and your dopamine threshold (the amount of dopamine something needs to generate for you to feel joy) is raised up.  At this new level, there is nothing in the world other than addictive substances that can cross the threshold, so when you initially quit drinking, everything in life feels meh, even hobbies and activities you used to love doing.\n\nOver time, your dopamine threshold will move back down to normal, and hobbies and activities will be fun again.  But it does take time.  If interested, watch this video by MD and recovery specialist, Dr. Nicole Labor, who talks about addiction and the brain, cravings, the dopamine threshold, and more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYvZTH746yg.\n\nBest wishes to you!", "score": 0, "created_utc": 1768054354.0, "id": "nyse69f", "author": "General-Buy-5543"}

The problem as I see is that for many years my only source of enjoyment was alcohol, so my brain just kept looking for that source.

Drinking always made me feel the exact same way and it trained me to approach everything like that. So I would do things because I want them to make me feel a certain way. \"I'm going to go for a walk because then I will feel refreshed and peaceful!\" And then I would get home and I wouldn't feel as good as I wanted and so suddenly in my mind that walk was a \\*failure\\*. And even during the walk I would get caught in my head thinking about how this walk isn't relaxing me as much as it should! Ugh! This sucks! What's the point?!

I didn't want to make commitments and then continue to break them. So I made a commitment for a period of time - my initial period was mid August to mid - October 2023 when we were traveling to Ireland (I knew I was going to drink there and was ok with that) - those 2 months taught me a lot about \"how\" to quit. Then when the year end was coming I knew that would be my beginning-  but again, I just made an iron clad commitment to one month (Jan 2024). I used both times as experiments for improving my health - I wanted to see if I felt better and lost weight- (yes and yes). But I also made a promise to myself just for those time periods. When the end of Dry January 2024 was approaching I extended to February- then Lent fell in the middle of that month so I extended for Lent to 4-1. During this time period I took note of everything in my life that was improving (my weight, my skin, my sleep, my mental health - the list goes on and on). The thing is though - I really knew deep down that it really was my very last drink at 11:50 p.m. on 12/31/23 - I just knew that I couldn't tell my lizard brain/inner child that. I tricked myself (very similar to the way I tricked myself into quitting smoking 25 years ago).\n\nTL;DR: For me the most important thing at the beginning was that iron clad commitment of Dry January. and for many people that commitment has to be a daily time frame - hence \"I will not drink with you today\" or AAs One day at at time.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768054477.0, "id": "nysej04", "author": "Tough_Got_Going"}

My husband said i look significantly less bloated and reminded me how beautiful he thinks I am, especially when I’m not drinking. I have Crohns Disease and I have noticed significant improvement in my symptoms since I cut the alcohol too. I no longer have to run to the bathroom after eating.\n\nSober life isn’t easy, especially in the beginnin , I have to make the conscious choice every morning, every afternoon, and every night that I am not going to drink. The positives are significantly outweighing the negatives though.\n\nTo those of you who are still in early sobriety with me, let’s white-knuckle another Saturday night and stay strong together.\n\nIWNDWYT!", "score": 5, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768062806.0, "id": "1q98k66", "author": "Black-Moon-Rabbit", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q98k66/7_full_days_sober/"}

The place was spotless, had obviously been cleaned that morning. I get in the stall, look down and I see a can of premixed rum and coke, drained.   \n  \nIt was like the object told the whole story. Someone had arrived for a funeral for someone they knew, maybe even loved, at around 9:00am. They'd locked themselves in the stall, on their own, drank this thing in secret, crushed the can and tried to hide it behind the toilet. Maybe to stop the shakes, maybe to 'get through' a eulogy, I don't know. I felt so bad for whoever that guy was. I recognised so much of what he must have been feeling, understood how someone could find themselves in this situation. There was so much shame in the way the can was crushed up.

Not a day goes by that my body doesn't wonder where our old friend has gone, or my mind doesn't play visions of cheap beer ads on an infinite loop. It's bizarre. I've always known I've had a problem but I didn't expect to have such a visceral reaction to removing alcohol from the equation.\n\nThe word \"alcoholic\" still intimidates me. Right now it feels more comfortable to simply say I have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol to the point where the drawbacks outweigh the positives 100 to 1. That 1 kept me hanging on for so long. That 1 cost me a lot. That 1 was a lie. Was I having fun or was I just having a diluted version of hierarchical needs being met? What needs did drinking meet that I couldn't have gotten without it?\n\nMaybe this has something to do with my new path, maybe it doesn't. But today I laughed and really felt it in my chest. It came easy. It sort of tickled. I haven't laughed like that in a long time.\n\nI bid farewell to the monkey on my back, just for today. I'm not thinking about a few months from now, a few years from now, or even a few decades from now. I'm thinking about how there's a damn monkey on my back! Get this thing off me!\n\nSee you soon.

Anyone!\n\nI’ve been awake since 5am with a stomach ache and major anxiety. I can’t make myself stop for a day or two without wanting more. I have a sleeve under the bed in my office I’ve been working through the last day, and even tho I have an upset stomach, I added shots on-top of my tummy issue. I want to sleep, but I also know I’m doing myself no good here.\n\nA bit of background; my ex (M 27) and I (M 27) broke up in early 2025. We were together for 2 and a half years, and knew each other since Kindergarten. Now I have no connection with him.\n\nI was devastated, but have found a new guy (M 24) the past few months who has been absolutely fantastic and makes me feel a bit better about life. This post would be longer if I gushed about how awesome he is, but I’ll save it. He knows I “struggled” with alcohol, and it’s why my ex broke up with me. I wanted to be drunk all the time (mind you, I’m a happy drunk, I am never an asshole when I drink, thankfully). I just never knew when to stop.\n\nI can’t stop drinking. No matter how good things are going.\n\nI’m over my ex, to an extent (the financial burdens he left me with is the only thing that reminds me of him, I do not miss him anymore at this point), he was the one who really started amping up my drinking. We loved to get crossfaded together with cannabis/alcohol, but it seemed to take a bigger hold on me than it did him. I never liked drinking until we got together.\n\nI do not blame my ex for my attraction to alcohol and its “solutions”, I fully take responsibility for spiraling with this crap.\n\nI can’t stop drinking. I can’t. I get off work, and all I can think about is going to the gas station and downing 3-4 shots before getting home. I chew gum to mask the smell on my breath with the new guy I’ve been with. He isn’t stupid and I know he will figure it out eventually.\n\nI have plenty of side hobbies (making/releasing music, collecting figures from movies I love, old video games, total nerding-out kind of hobbies lol), and I know what I’m doing is not good for me. Nothing fulfills me without that buzz.\n\nI’m tired of taking shots. Hiding them somewhere; my car armrest, my desk, my office closet, things like that.\n\nI feel helpless. I feel like I have no other way to cope. Im embarrassed of myself.\n\nI don’t want to destroy the past 3 months with the new guy, over hiding my addiction and telling him I’ve been over it since my ex and I broke up.\n\nThe new guy smokes cannabis as much as I did before this crap started. I live in a legal state, have a spinal issue that allowed me to get a medical card in ‘21, and love what the products do for me. However, THC started to make me feel anxious/paranoid after I started drinking and the stress of life began creeping in heavily the past year. Thanks to him, I can consume and not have as much cravings while high. But yet, here I am, still trying to figure out what to do with myself, knowing this is not good for my health or social/romantic life.\n\nWhat I’m really over, is myself.\n\nSorry this is so long.

Maybe not right at that moment, but certainly it will go there.\n\nThe funny thing is being one of those people that alcohol does not compute with has been a blessing for all of the time after it left my body and mind.

But one noticeable change in myself is the difference in the quality of my erections. To anyone with a penis, if you’re looking for just one more reason to quit, your boners may improve drastically.\n\nI wasn’t getting drunk every day, but I was having a couple every day and getting just past the point of tipsy. As my tolerance seemed to grow this took more and more alcohol. I didn’t want anyone to realize how much alcohol I was drinking compared to them, so I would do the unthinkable by stopping somewhere along the way of any drive and slamming a large IPA or something while driving. At first it started as a youthful moment of rebellion, but I soon realized that I was really looking forward to the rush of drinking and driving without getting caught on a daily basis. I’d be at work thinking about it and I’d be upset if work kept me past midnight because then I couldn’t have that rush of trying to get tipsy before I reached my house. So obviously I had a problem with drinking at this point and it was no longer safe for me or others.\n\nAnyways, we all know the positives of quitting like saving money, improved mental health, losing weight, no more stupid mistakes, etc., but one positive I hadn’t heard of or considered is that my boners would be concrete. This is TMI, but I’m trying to give another form of hope for the boys and trans. \n\nEver notice that you could still get hard, but maybe you weren’t standing at full attention? Like, it’s up, but it’s not as solid anymore. You can get the job done, but you’re not going to be holding anyone’s body weight up with your flagpole like you used to? Well since quitting I feel like a high schooler again down there.\n\nI’m getting random hard ons, being more turned on that I have been in years, and the size feels like it’s doubled. You know what I’m talking about, the ones that feel like they could tear through some pants if you just flex it a little. So that’s a bonus that people either don’t mention or I haven’t seen. \n\n(I am not a doctor and I could be entirely wrong. This could be a side effect of anything else, but I can only attribute it to the lack of alcohol because that’s the biggest change I’ve had in my life recently.)\n\n ", "score": 390, "num_comments": 162, "created_utc": 1767966943.0, "id": "1q88vd9", "author": "FakeJackNicholson", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q88vd9/one_huge_bonus_i_didnt_expect_when_quitting/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "constantly reminded of my rock bottom", "text": "I am a girl in my mid 20s and essentially I drank way too much at a work party last month, got called an ambulance to the hospital by HR (I know, lol, it turned out to be the absolute worst case scenario) and was babysat by coworkers late into the  night at the hospital. God knows what I did or said in the hours I was at the event blacked out. I don’t even want to know.\n\nI’ve been aware I have a problem since I started drinking at 18. But this was genuinely rock bottom. Especially because it was so hard to find this job after being laid off earlier this year. Before, I’d been able to keep my work and drinking separate (excluding being constantly hungover at work or calling out sick due to hangovers) and this felt like a new line I crossed that I don’t know how to come back from.\n\nI wasn’t fired or anything, but everyone certainly has a different opinion of me now vs before and it’s palpable. I made an excuse about being on a new medication but not sure if anyone actually bought it. Seem to be generally on thin ice with everyone.\n\nI am 100% committed to sobriety. Waking up that next morning, I knew that there were only 2 options - get sober or end my life. because I knew if I kept drinking this wouldn’t be the last time I’d have to feel such unbearable shame (have had endless embarrassing incidents in the past in a variety of situations). So I knew I had to get sober if I didnt want to break my family’s hearts by ending my life altogether.\n\nI do feel much better and the main thing that’s making me hopeful is knowing I never have to put myself in any kind of compromising situation or be out of control of my behavior ever again. Also not to brag (but also to brag) I look amazing (clear skin finally, -5 lbs, in case anyone needs any extra motivation, LOL!)\n\nI feel generally positive about my life moving forward and believe in myself to stick with this and do what’s actually best for my mental health and wellbeing. This wasn’t my first hospitalization due to alcohol… and I’m only 24. It was just the first one at work 😭\n\nThe issue is having to be at this job everyday in a confined office space, around coworkers who’ve seen me at my absolute worst. My boss seems to have moved past it and we have a positive relationship. But I hate that I can’t scream to everyone “I know I had a problem, but I’m sober now, I’m better now, I’m not that embarrassing version of myself” but that’s obviously not appropriate or necessary. I just wish they didn’t think I was still walking around as that sad broken out of control  version of myself.\n\nI know as time passes people forget and move on, but it’s a terrible reminder coming in every day that all of these people were there for my rock bottom without any context as to my struggles or level of self-awareness. I’m scared they just see me as a young blonde party girl who doesn’t know her limits or take her work seriously or care about the repercussions of her actions. I know that’s not me- I do care, and I care a lot. I care about others, being kind, showing up in a positive way in the world. I just wasn’t always able to do those things because I’ve been captured by this disease my entire adult life.\n\nIt never felt like I was actively making bad choices, but rather like I was simply reacting to impulses that I had to drink excessively in order to cope with life. It felt like there was no other way.\n\nI know now that I do have a choice, but I just wish everyone knew my entire struggle and how deeply I regret and feel shame about this incident. I know that’s not how life works and as they say perception is reality. I guess that just makes me feel uneasy and upset. I hate the feeling of being misunderstood. Not to mention, beyond this incident, there are hundreds of other people walking around the world who have some other terrible image/memory of who I am that isn’t the real me. And it’s just frustrating. I’m sure many of us feel this way.\n\nI guess I don’t have a question. Just needed to share this with someone.

Not a drop, except the one time I accidentally took a sip of someone’s IPA instead of my NA. I hadn’t planned for that situation, but I went to the bathroom and spit it out.\n\nThere have been so many moments where I started to justify “just one.” Then I remember that one is just enough to make ten feel reasonable. Every morning I wake up genuinely glad I didn’t drink the day before.\n\nThe biggest change by far is that I don’t feel shame and loathing when I look in the mirror anymore. Early on, after one of my many failed attempts, I remember posting that I “fucking hate myself.” I hated knowing I was pissing my kids’ childhoods away. I hated knowing they would remember my booze breath. I hated being hungover around them and showing up as a watered down version of myself.\n\nThat self loathing is gone. That’s the best part of this so far.\n\nI may have inspired at least one friend to quit. He randomly reached out and told me he was on day 20. That meant more to me than I expected.\n\nI’ve also learned that people really don’t care that I don’t drink.\n\nThe physical stuff has been nice too. I’ve lost weight. My skin looks better. Smoother, less puffy, spider veins way reduced. I’m sleeping better. I stayed healthy through the holidays, which never happens.\n\nOne side effect is that I absolutely hate being around people who are hammered now. They smell. They repeat the same dumb punchlines. They’re boring. They’re gross.\n\nWhile I don’t hate myself anymore and I’m actually proud of myself, I’m not yet much happier. Most evenings I’m still just counting the hours until I can go to sleep. I’m guessing that part comes later.\n\nGoing in for updated labs soon and I’m looking forward to seeing some progress.\n\nGrateful for you all. \n\nIWNDWYT", "score": 21, "num_comments": 5, "created_utc": 1768025137.0, "id": "1q8wfdu", "author": "303WPG", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8wfdu/i_dont_fing_hate_myself/"}

I'm on a similar journey, but not alone (with a tee total partner who is away most of my waking hours) the boredom at 6 gets me most days. \n\nThe next day I don't drink, the hungover is enough to put me off (GABA supplément to replace what alcohol withrawal wiped out helps, L-Theanine as well. Just don't take GABA with alcohol!). Day two sober I usually feel better and by 6 the cravings get me. \n\nJust one glass of course - then I finish the bottle or two. Fortunately I have two hunting dogs, so whatever state I am in, I start the day in nature and usually do around 10km+ hiking/walking on a good day. \n\nFinally I decided to end this cycle, talked to my doctor and have naltrexone prescribed. I have been hesitating to start it, somehow the loss of joy of that first drink stopped me, which is ridiculous knowing it's a highly toxic substance I pour into my body in large quantities. \n\nI started 2 days ago, with half a dose to prepare for side-effects. It makes me a bit drowsy, so I'll probably take it late afternoon before I'd want to drink like the Sinclair method. Last night I drank. It was weird, somehow I knew I was getting drunk but the euphoria wasn't there. Still drunk though. Today I'm going full dose! It helped so many people here, I have to trust the process and start reprogramming my brain.\n\nAccountability also helps, if you have anyone who you can share your struggle with. This group is amazing, I have a cousin who knows and is also trying to quit and I use the reframe app, where I log how much I drink and try to reduce gradually, along with helpful psychological guidance. \n\nThat's it, you can do it, I can do it, I will replace boredom with something useful instead of poisoning myself! \n\nToday I will not drink with you!", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768032114.0, "id": "nyr4hty", "author": "Dull_Engineering_583"}

Drunk people get really in your face and don't realize the concept of personal space, and it annoyed me. Even when it was my friend who I normally adore and don't feel weird with being close to.\n3.

I am a /casual/ smoker (well.. smoke everywhere except for at home weirdly enough) and I felt less inclined to smoke every 15 minutes. The alcohol really adds onto the craving.\n5. I am now in bed, without feeling like needing to eat greasy food and drinking a liter of water to prevent a hangover. I feel clean. I feel like I will have a nice sleep. I took my makeup off and brushed my teeth like I would do any normal night. When drunk I would either skip or do it half.\n\nLastly, I am so tired.

I'm sitting with my thoughts and thought I'd put some of them down, in part so that I can look back on them as time goes on.\n\n- I had a bit of a cheat start with a frankly chaotic bout of gastro. So my first weekend didn't really 'count' I guess - but I'll take any advantage i can!\n\n- within days my face was less puffy and my eyes looked brighter.

I know that makes me sound a bit vain but again - motivation is an advantage so I'll take it!\n\n- have i been tempted to have just one a couple of times? Yep! There's been some speed wobbles. But each time I've had a speed wobble I've put my thinking brain back in charge, not my instant-gratification brain. I 'just' need to keep doing that.\n\n- I'm so incredibly grateful for the people around me. I haven't even told people that I've stopped drinking, so they don't know to be supportive. But they're still being so supportive just because they're lovely - no questions, no pressure to drink. On the one hand I'm very lucky, but on the other hand I'm part of my friend group too - together we've built a lovely vibe.\n\n- I'm on my own this weekend at home. Last night (Friday night) felt easy. Tonight feels very doable too - I have coke zero in the fridge, I have things I want to watch on telly, and then I'll have an excellent sleep and will wake up fresh on Sunday. That looks very different to previous weekends home alone!\n\n- I know that this is likely the pink cloud or whatever it's called. I know that it'll get waaaaaaay harder. But I'll ride this positivity for as long as I need to, and build some of those willpower muscles. And then when the time comes I'll remind myself that I can do hard things!

It’s an amino acid that promotes calm focus, no drowsiness, and you can get it OTC for cheap. Increases GABA, improves sleep, and people who drink caffeine report it’s a perfect pairing (I believe prescribed stimulant users also take it to mitigate the unpleasant effects of those drugs). It has worked wonders for me. Take the recommended dose, no stupid “maxing.” I usually take it when I’m winding down for the day along with my multivitamin (which has some magnesium as I believe most do). It works within like 30 minutes, it’s tangible, not at all habit forming (I constantly forget to take it). Amazingly useful and gentle.\n\nI saw benefit from 5-HTP after quitting, another amino acid and a direct precursor to seratonin. It’s occasionally recommended to people with mild depression or intermittent depressive episodes, my doc mentioned it to me. In effect it acts as a mood stabilizer. Typically taken before bed, evening you out the next day. It definitely made me drowsy when I took it, and I did notice an evening out of sorts when I was consistent with it. It can make you kinda gassy.\n\nThese two amino acids in combination with a B-complex vitamin will go a long way to helping your mind and body adjust to a lack of alcohol.", "score": 3, "created_utc": 1768051210.0, "id": "nys5fml", "author": "BackupTrailer"}

I would read some of the stories on here and think \"wow i'm glad I never let it get that bad\".\n\n  \nI decided I actually don't care if I have a problem yet or not, because regardless of the current answer, I know that I was on a path to a problem eventually.

So thank you to this community.\n\nOne of the greatest gifts of my sobriety has been the ability to be \\*\\*present\\*\\* in my life. I am in touch with my emotions now, rather than being beholden to them. When these \"dark days\" arrive, I’ve noticed they are far less frequent, less deep, and much shorter than they were during my drinking days.\n\nI’m not sure if that’s a direct result of not having the depressant effects of alcohol in my system, or a result of the other life changes I’ve made since quitting—most likely, it’s a combination of both.\n\nIf you are in a funk today, or if you are white-knuckling your way through Day 10: hang in there. It passes. You are doing the work, and the clarity is waiting for you on the other side.\n\n\\*\\*IWNDWYT\\*\\*", "score": 11, "num_comments": 1, "created_utc": 1768009209.0, "id": "1q8qys4", "author": "Forward_Pea_9555", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8qys4/dry_januaryists_day_9_the_fog_has_lifted/"}

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*\n\n**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**\n\nI'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.\n\nMaybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!\n\n\\---\n\n**This pledge is a statement of intent.**  Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink.*  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!\n\nWhat happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.\n\n**What this is:**  A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.\n\n**What this isn't:**  A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.\n\n\\---\n\nThis post goes up at:\n\n\\- US - Night/Early Morning\n\n\\- Europe - Morning\n\n\\- Asia and Australia - Evening/Night\n\nA link to the current Daily Check-In post  can always be found near the top of the sidebar.\n\n\\---\n\nHey Friends!  Happy Friday!\n\nLet’s talk about **Freedom** today.\n\nI try to always remind myself that *sobriety is a gain*, *not a loss*.  It provides us the freedom to live a fulfilling life without the chains and cycle of destruction.\n\nFor me, I have the freedom to do what I want when I want.  I’m no longer planning the next drink.  Making plans based on whether drinking can be involved.  Figuring out rides to and from events.  I have given myself this freedom and it’s absolutely wonderful.  \n\nSomething I’ve done a few times sober is go to concerts alone.  I’m confident and aware of my surroundings.  I save money. And I can drive to and from the venue without relying on other people.\n\nWhat’s something that you get to do sober that used to feel impossible?\n\nShare your “freedom” moment with us!\n\n**IWNDWYT**", "score": 675, "num_comments": 1310, "created_utc": 1767927368.0, "id": "1q7wm4m", "author": "LetItKindle", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q7wm4m/the_daily_checkin_for_friday_january_9th_just_for/"}

Where to start?\n\nThe first thing is the freedom from the clutches of alcohol mind (I have a name for her that I won’t use here). That incessant brain noise after that first sip: how much can I have? How can I pace myself? How much do I have at home? Am I gonna do something stupid? Etc., etc. \n\nThen there’s the freedom to come to something and to follow through — medical appointments, spontaneous friend/family stuff, etc.\n\nThe third is freedom to be accountable. I have been pretty ill this week, still not 100% - but I showed up when I needed to. No dramatics, just getting it done.\n\nThe last is freedom is to be present in my own life.

I always just thought that was who I was, and that there wasn't much more to it. My partner jokingly said I would've easily lost this jump drive a couple years ago, considering I couldn't even keep track of my damn car.

Can currently handle but may seek external support.\n\n- Quit was aided by influenza A. Really took care of those first few weeks.\n\n- There is no moderation. There is no going back. The season finale has happened. It’s done. I now accept this. Even after 6 months, a year, whatever the time period may be, being a normal (whatever the hell that is) drinker does not exist anymore for me and never will again and that is absolutely fine.\n\n- Bars, restaurants, social settings have all been quite manageable. The last bastion, the last test for me, will be flying with lounge access and a nervous disposition. Will need a good plan here.\n\n- Feel a bit healthier and sleeping well. Don’t feel perfect, but I’ll sort my diet out and take this win.\n\n- lastly, this community is the absolute best.

I didn't like what I had become and how hard it was to get through even an afternoon without drinking. It become my only preoccupation. I had so. Much. Anxiety. It also didn't help that I worked in restaurants and it was easy to have a serious problem being with other alcoholics and a bar at work. \n\nAbout a year ago an interaction with my now ex was life changing. Acter, I ended up going to my friends house where I drank a liter of pb whiskey. When I finally got home, I took a shower. When I was in the shower I heard the door open (I've suffered a lot of abuse so even when I was wasted I was still hypervilligent with my environment). To my surprise it was my 6 year old kid.. I got upset because my ex was supposed to be caring for them because I didn't want them to see me so out of control. I yelled my exs name and ended up scaring my kid. I will NEVER forget the look in their eyes when they saw me and how their little body trembled when I yelled (I usually never yell). Since that night  I quit. I was sick in bed unable to move and throwing up for 3 days straight. I thought I was going to die. I kept replaying my kids horrified face seeing me ... to make sure I wouldn't let this happen again.\n\nFast forward a year, I've been in therapy. I've built a support network and I'm gaining a lot of momentum in my life. \n\nI still feel sad I spent so many years running. Hiding from myself and the pain. The pain the kept me so close to the bottle. I can't express how much better my body feels now after a year of sobriety. My nervous system is finally starting to come back online and I'm thankful to actually *FEEL* again. I've realized when I numbed it not only not made me feel the bad things, it also made it so I couldn't feel the *GOOD* either. \n\nIt's still hard.. and even a whif of alcohol is still enough to make me feel like a shark smelling blood in the water. But I can do this. You can do this. We can do this. I wish everyone else out there struggling... wondering if it'll ever be worth it... and all of those in pain... strength and clarity. \n\nHere's to 1 year sober, I can't believe I've done it!!

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "i’ve been using video games as a distraction for years now, but they’ve been especially helpful for my 50 some odd days of sobriety. I’ve personally found survival type games to be the ones that eat the most time away, because *there’s always something to do* and for me, that tickles my brain just the right way. \n\nMy favorites are Subnautica and The Long Dark. \nSubnautica is just so fantastically done, with an amazing map to explore, a great story, and solid crafting/looting/building system. I think the 2nd one is worth playing too if you like the first game. \n\nThe Long Dark is bit more challenging, but another great way to pass the time. It has a good story and a pretty awesome survival mode. It can be unforgiving, but in a way that drives me to learn and explore more, and keeps me coming back. \n\nGreen Hell deserves a mention, especially if you like a Jungle setting. \n\nAbiotic Factor has survival elements, but is more of a story driven game, so not quite the same.  It’s absolutely amazing though, especially with a friend. SCP lovers rejoice! \n\nBut if none of those sound interesting, i can say with certainty, another playthrough of RDR2 would absolutely kill time. I can’t recall how many hours i put into my 100% playthrough, but it was a lot, and i only ended up around 90% before giving up. That one, i think, maybe took too much time.

I find long RPGs really help and are the ones that keep you invested. The main problem of alcohol is it can be paired with anything to increase the enjoyment levels of the activity. That's why I feel heavy narrative games that require your attention are the best distraction.\n\n-Witcher 3: Amazing adventure that will sink away your time just as Skyrim. Just don't get too caught up in Gwent. Intertwining stories and tales that require your attention are great for avoiding the current world situation.\n\n-Persona 5 Royal: Extremely long adventure which rewards you the more you take your time. This game is such a good distraction as it requires your time and attention and rewards you with an incredibly well written story. The music with a jazzy vibe will be stuck in your head. Personal favourite but can't go wrong with Persona 4 or Persona 3 Reload as well.\n\n-Expedition 33: This game deserves all the hype it gets. This game will resonate with anyone as we eventually all suffer the same story beats. Unforgettable story and music that will stick with you. It requires you to explore and really immerse yourself in the story and adds some childlike humour to lift the spirits.\n\n-Astrobot: Not an RPG, but this game was a pleasant surprise and truly a love letter to what gaming can be. Full of references and platforming that never stop the goal of the player having fun.\n\n-Mass Effect trilogy: Three games of content, great characters but an underwhelming ending. The gameplay is tight and you really get to immerse yourself in space politics.\n\n-Arkham trilogy: It's Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill at the top of their game in a Batman love letter to the fans. The third has a bit too much vehicular combat, but if you grew up in the 90s with the animated cartoon this one is a must play.\n\n-Baldurs Gate 3: This one is tricky as for myself it has triggers, it's very dialogue heavy which is good, but every time I play I feel it could be better if I had a few brews alongside the adventure. Absolutely immersive world with so many options of story routes. My biggest problem is save scumming which also hinders my Skyrim playthroughs.\n\n-Final Fantasy 16: While not for everyone it's a medieval world with Attack on Titan powers, what more could you want? Very divisive game but I had a great time after an initial slog of how the game was going to be (very cutscene heavy). The music is great and varied, the boss battles give the adrenaline rush one would get after purchasing alcohol.\n\n-Slay the Spire: Not an RPG, more of a deck builder card game.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "4 weeks", "text": "It's been 28 days since I had my last drink, it was a full blown alcohol induced blackout, here are the changes I noticed\n\nSleep in the first 3 days were absolute torture, I could probably sleep 4 hours daily and go the rest of the day like a zombie and at night roll around in bed until barely fall asleep at almost daylight for another 4 hours and repeat. Now almost a month later I could fall asleep somewhat normally again, although my body clock is still messed up, and I still have trouble sleep pass 7 hours a day.\n\nBrain fog in the first 3 weeks were so bad I basically lost my capacity to think or initiate any social interaction. Sure I could engage in a conversation but there was always a wall in my head that blocked me, and is still blocking me albeit lesser so to come up with new topics for conversations and new ideas, for me to be the one who initiates rather than passively responding. Now it improved slightly but I still have trouble puting my idea into words even if I could form them in my head.\n\nNo energy: I feel more energized and clearheaded in the morning when I first got up, but that little energy is quickly drained around 2pm, I would be so tired with a foggy mind for the rest of the day and lose all capability to think and just want to get the day over with and go to bed. 4 weeks in I can stay sharp for a little longer, maybe to around 3-4pm, then fatigue and brain fog again.\n\nHeadache has gotten slightly better, I drank plenty of water but it doesn't seem to help, for the first 2 weeks the headache felt like something was pinching my brain from within, paired with the constant brain fog even reading became a luxury. Now I still have headaches daily but it became slightly more tolerable. Since water doesn't seem to help I think I can only ride this out with time.\n\nFor more than half of the nights since I gone sober I was plagued by some kind of bad dreams, sometimes it's straight up nightmare being chased by demons that looked as if it came straight out of a Lovecraftian book, sometimes by humanoid figures that looked human but there are something terrifyingly creepy about them, I could fly in those dreams but those entities always flied faster than me even at full speed like they were toying with me, it was sheer horror and desperation; other dreams were eerie but not quite terrifying, most of them were fragmented, with little pieces here and there so I couldn't quite piece together what I just dreamed, but one thing I do remember they were all in realms without sunlight, some were grey and some looked like dark forests, some in abandoned schools that were suddenly filled with people... like I wouldn't be surprised if you tell me I've been briefly pulled into the afterlife in those dreams. But regardless dreams of demons or some grey purgatory, the common theme all these dreams had was hopelessness, I'm stuck there for eternity with no way out.\n\nBut even I'm going through these problems, headaches, brain fogs, insomnia ,dreams of demonic worlds, I have faith that it will all pass. I've been drinking heavily for over 4 years, the damage has been done and the healing will take much longer than a month I'm sure. So I made the bed and now I have to sleep in it.\n\nI'll probably make an update in another post that's more coherent once I'm in a better mental state, right now the brain fog hasn't completely lifted yet which you could surely see from my writings of my poor mental performance.", "score": 9, "num_comments": 3, "created_utc": 1767998708.0, "id": "1q8mux6", "author": "efthegreat", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q8mux6/4_weeks/"}

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "5 YEARS SOBER!!!", "text": "I don't think I've ever felt more pride than I do this week. Yesterday was my victory lap. 5 years ago I made the best, hardest, and most important decision of my life and took my last drink. In making that decision I also decided I wanted to live. I realized I wanted and deserved better than I had led myself to believe and that I wasn't just the sum of my all mistakes which were plentiful. \n\nI was going to write this whole long thing about what I've learned in sobriety but honestly the only thing that matters to me this. In a few months I'm giving birth to a little girl and although I know I won't be a perfect mom, I know down to my core that I'm going to be a loving, calm, and steadfast presence in her life. My daughter will know that I've done the work and will continue to do so I can always be there for her. One thing I told myself over and over again after I got sober was that I did not pull myself out of hell to live a life I didn't want to live. Part of the goal is creating a life you don't want to escape from. That meant making hard decisions, having hard conversations, being honest about what I do and don't want out of life, and stepping many miles outside of my comfort zone. And to me our daughter is a manifestion that.\n\nIm grateful to be alive. I grateful to be out of the darkness. I'm grateful to my friends and family that loved me even when I was a mess. I'm especially grateful to my husband who has been there every single step. I did the heavy lifting but he never shamed me. He just loved me and gave me a safe space to do the work so I could save myself. It is the kindest thing anyone has done for me. \n\nIf you're still struggling I just have this to say: Sobriety is more than just not drinking. It's a healing process. For me it felt like I was relearning how to exist in the world. Be kind and patient with yourself. You didn't get to this place in your life overnight. It's going to take time to untangle all the knots. But when you do I promise it is the most beautiful, freeing, and rewarding thing you'll ever experience. ❤️", "score": 283, "num_comments": 20, "created_utc": 1767922507.0, "id": "1q7urlx", "author": "mct318", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1q7urlx/5_years_sober/"}

Might not sound like a lot but it is probably the longest I have went in years with non-alcohol sequential days. \n\nFor background, I started drinking quite heavily when I was 25, I am now 37. I excused it as a bit of fun, I was a mature student and it seemed to come with the territory. What I didn't realise was how I would get so sucked in. I craved anaesthesia. I had some life stuff going on at the time and I convinced myself my drinking was a \"normal and healthy\" amount. I realise now that I was lying to myself, using it to dampen my fears and give me a false sense of bravery.\n\nIn 2019, my dad died, complications caused by cirrhosis, caused by long-term alcohol abuse. My dad was a brilliant man and we knew he liked a drink but he worked all his life as an engineer, so he never drank during the day, just when he wasn't at work, so I didn't see it as a problem (it was all I knew, home from work, can in hand). In the end, he was emaciated. Somehow no ascites, but he kept suffering from an infected layer of tissue that covers the organs (can't remember what it's called) and later encephaly. Seeing him like that and realising that he used alcohol the same way I was made me really rethink my habits. He was always there for us, willing to help and guide in any way possible but below that role, he was using alcohol as a coping mechanism, and it ended up being a slow suicide. I wish I could say that after he passed, I immediately spurned into positive action but...I didn't. In fact, I just came up with new excuses why that wouldn't be me. I told myself he drank from much younger right until he was 67, the age he was diagnosed with liver failure (died a year later) and that I had time. But recently, I developed a pain in my side, good old pancreatitis and I know what caused it. I lie to the doctor but I know...\n\nApologies for the lengthy post. But yeah, 10 days in and finally making it happen. We can't choose how we die but slow suicide won't be mine. I am pleased that I have had no complications not drinking so a saving grace is that my problem was likely more habitual than full chemical reliance.\n\nWishing everybody strength in this journey.

It wasn’t until I was fully awake that I realized I was dreaming about throwing back shot after shot of whiskey.  I might be reading too much into it but I think my “nope not going back to sleep” reaction was my mind saying “absolutely not. We don’t do that anymore”.  Instead of going back to bed, I extended my morning coffee quiet time, did some chores, and spent an hour or so reading through posts on here then went about my day without even looking at hubby’s bottle of whiskey and thinking “weeeeelllll maybe”.  Then later at work, we had a celebration for the owners: every person over 21 today got a complimentary glass of bubbles to celebrate with them.  I finished my shift, cheers-ed regulars, coworkers, and friends with my Guinness 0, and came home to walk the dog.  For today, on both counts, I consider this Friday a win.

Both are terrible habits but I will focus on the drinking being that that's what this subreddit is for... The drinking started off slowly then got worse when I lost my home shortly after.

To top it off I have bad anxiety and health anxiety and as we know, even though we think drinking helps short term, long term it makes everything worse.

She prescribed naltrexone, which I took daily for 6 weeks to help with the worst of it.\n\nI chose the day, and tapered down a week ahead with the help of my husband. I got the house in order, stocked up on ice cream, candy, tea, and sparkling waters, along with some frozen meals my husband could eat. \n\nI changed my sheets and washed my bedding and lined up some movies, books, and podcasts to occupy my time, and declared myself out of commission.

I couldn’t picture my life without alcohol, but that was the addiction tricking me so it could keep having its precious.\n\nIt’s not impossible and it gets easier the more distance you put between yourself and your last drink.

{"type": "post", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "title": "31 days today.", "text": "I’m 37 and this is the longest I’ve gone without drinking since I turned 21. In my mid 20’s I overcame a serious addiction to prescription painkillers. Until COVID I was a fairly moderate drinker, maybe somewhat of a binge drinker. The last 6 years I’ve seen myself devolve into undeniable alcoholism. Hanging at my local dive bar 5-6 days a week. Drinking every night. Feeling like shit at work every day. I couldn’t make it more than 2 days without drinking. Constantly anxious, high BP, stomach issues, body getting soft (I’ve always been lean and athletic), my body was just telling me it was time. I went on a big bender in early December and just decided enough was enough. 3 days before my birthday I decided I was done. Today I’m 31 days sober. Been feeling all of the highs and lows that come with early sobriety as expected. The holidays, my birthday, new years, and two deaths in my family in that timespan were all huge challenges that made me consider drinking, but I made it through without.. I work in the trades, and have been laid off for the last 2 months, which gave me plenty of fuel to feed into my alcoholism. Unemployment has barely been covering basic expenses, and finances have been a huge stessor. I didn’t know how I was going to continue paying for school that started this week. I’m 3/4 years in to an apprenticeship, and without school - I’m out of my line of work completely. At the last second I was able to miraculously obtain a grant through my college to pay my tuition this term. Then my old company called me last week. They want me to come back starting Monday. I can finally pay my rent on time. I can pay my utilities the month they’re due. I can go the gym 5-6 nights a week because I feel ok enough to do so. Life is looking so much better than it did only 31 days ago..

{"type": "comment", "subreddit": "stopdrinking", "text": "I never drank the way I did because of stress. I did so because I'm alcoholic. That means that when I put alcohol in my body, I crave it. I need to have more and more. I find it hard to stop. I felt it when I had my first two very tall beers at age 15 up until I stopped twenty years later. A mental obsession develops and my life becomes increasingly unmanageable. Everything suffers...relationships, health, finances, work,  sanity, etc.\n\nThat's just the way it is. I'm just one of those people who can't drink just one. It's not a question of character flaws, being a bad person, or weakness. I'm just plain old powerless over what alcohol does in this body of mine. I'm alcoholic. Not an alcoholic, just alcoholic. It's a condition not an identity. In the end, I just can't drink safely.\n\nSo, I avoid the first drink at all costs. In the beginning of sobriety, that meant finding a support group and participating (I ended up being the guy who made the coffee for my group). I also had a close friend who I could call anytime if I was struggling. I ate sweets to curb cravings. Evnetually I cleared up, and one day at a time, I've managed to put many years of sobriety in.\n\nA sober life is vastly different than a drunken one. If I avoid that action of drinking the first drink at all costs, one day at a time, I stand a chance at life.

I don't know if I would ever say that I ever was an alcoholic, the label isnt really important, but a short backstory before I go on;   \n  \nAbout a month ago I messed up, again. I go to university, and I used to go out with my friends and have fun drinking. I had a habit of going a bit too overboard, my upbringing wasnt easy and I never really had a social life until recently where I could learn my limits with drinking. I've never been used to going out drinking, and I believe that this is a big reason why I keep messing up maybe? This entire situation lead to my friends being put in a unfortunate situation of needing to help me get home, which is emberrasing for both parties. Its happened a couple of times, and this lead to them giving me the silent treatment after the last time. This really hit my mental hard, as I have trauma related to that (which they knew), and they used it to teach me a lesson, leaving me spiraling mentally to a really dark place for a couple of days. We made up though, I understand their perspective, but im also not happy with how they went about dealing with the situation in hindsight.\n\nThis brings me to the topic at hand too, tomorrow they're going out, they want me to come with, but sober. I already went out with them once after that ordeal sober, which was not a problem, but it was unbelievably boring to me. I feel like they already labeled me, and they are removing my autonomy and not giving me a chance to prove that ive learnt my lesson. It makes me really sad, because i feel like im missing out on a very important part of being in uni, which is socializing. I do socialize when im sober too, but I feel like going out with them with a few drinks is important, and im scared that if I just don't drink with them that they will eventually just disappear from my life and I'll go back to being alone again like I was for many years.
